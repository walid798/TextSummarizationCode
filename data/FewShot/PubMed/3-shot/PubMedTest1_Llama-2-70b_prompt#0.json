        "generated": "The article discusses the role of a variant in the retn gene in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. The authors analyzed data from 130 trio families and found an excess transmission of a mutant allele at the retn-420 locus using TDT analysis. They suggest that inherited variation in the retn gene at -420 is associated with heritable acne vulgaris. This finding could have implications for the understanding of the genetic basis of acne and potentially lead to new therapeutic targets for the treatment of the disease.",
