LED screens blared out televised coverage of the counting of results at important intersections in the city.Although the Indian media started reporting in the afternoon that Modi had won (possibly looking at the margin of votes with which he was leading), the final results came in only in the evening, when BJP supporters erupted in euphoric chants and slogans that later spilled over into fireworks and colors.They smeared each other with saffron and green colors, distributed sweets and took out small victory processions. But in general, celebrations were muffled, as election Commission officials had banned victory processions in Varanasi (and throughout Uttar Pradesh, which has seen major communal riots in the recent past) after results were announced.AAP\u2019s Kejriwal, who reached Varanasi on Friday morning, was stoic about his defeat.\u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s verdict,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cWe have to accept it.\u201dFor a new party and with much less financial clout than the BJP, the Kejriwal-led AAP had undoubtedly put up a laudable fight against the indomitable Modi wave that had engulfed most of India in elections 2014. Kejriwal had walked away with 1,79,739 of the votes, relegating the Congress party\u2019s Ajay Rai, local strongman, to the third position.\u201cTough luck for AAP. We keep talking about change but when it comes to bringing it in, we shy away,\u201d says Aloke Thakur, a small trader, looking disappointed as the results were announced.Modi is expected to be in Varanasi on Saturday evening to celebrate his and his party\u2019s win with a Ganga Aaarti\u2014an invocation of the river Ganges\u2014a grand evening ritual that attracts people from all over the world to the shores of the river Ganges in Varanasi.\u201cWe are happy Modi won, he has said he will transform Varanasi in one year,\u201d says Dipu Majhi, a first time voter, who voted for the BJP. \u201cLet\u2019s see what he does.\u201dGolu Sahni, another first time voter says, \u201cIf not, then we can always change our mind after five years."},

It targets a type of breast cancer called her2/neu-positive breast cancer, which affects between 20 percent and 30 percent of breast cancer patients.Like Provenge, Neuvenge is made using immune cells from the cancer patient, so it is a tailor-made vaccine.Dr. John Park of the University of California, San Francisco and colleagues tested it in 18 women with advanced her2/neu-positive breast cancer, whose cancer had spread despite treatment.Writing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the researchers said the vaccine did not cause any serious side effects and appeared to help at least one patient.\"We saw a partial response, meaning a reduction in the size of tumor area in one patient that was certainly attributable to the treatment,\" Park said in a telephone interview.In three other women, their cancer appeared to stabilize for as long as a year, something that could have been due to treatment, Park said.Park said the effects justify moving from the Phase 1 safety trial to a Phase 2 trial, which would be designed to show the treatment actually helps patients. But that may not happen for a while, he said.\"The sponsor of this vaccine technology, Dendreon, is also associated with Provenge,\" Park said.\"We on the breast cancer side are trying to encourage them to develop Neuvenge with the same vigor that they have tried to apply to Provenge, but it is not a company that has unlimited resources.\"In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted Dendreon's marketing application for Provenge on a \"fast-track\" basis, and in March an advisory panel said Provenge appeared reasonably safe. But the FDA has asked Dendreon to show the vaccine helps prostate cancer patients actually live longer.Dr. Dave Urdal, chief scientific officer at Seattle-based Dendreon, said that data would not be available any sooner than next year, and perhaps not until 2010.\"The company currently is focused on its lead product, Provenge, so moving forward with the Neuvenge product is something that we haven't given guidance on,\" Urdal said in a telephone interview.The delay in approval of Provenge has angered some patient advocacy groups.Urdal said both Provenge and Neuvenge make use of immune system cells called CD4 helper T-cells.\"This validates the approach. So there is more than one target and more than one cancer that potentially will benefit from this form of therapy,\" he said. Other companies are also working on cancer vaccines.The her2/neu protein is over-expressed, meaning it is over-active, in several tumors including breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer.The vaccine is a therapeutic vaccine, meaning it stimulates an immune response to existing disease. The patient's T-cells are removed, \"trained\" to recognize the her2/neu protein, and then re-infused into the patient."},

And there's no way of knowing for sure that people who announce candidates actually submitted a legitimate nomination to the award committee.Kristian Harpsviken, a leading Nobel-watcher and director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said he didn't consider WikiLeaks as a strong candidate for the 10 million kronor ($1.6 million) award.\"The reason I think it's unlikely is that there has been so much criticism of WikiLeaks, not least how they have handled identification issues of people in the documents,\" he said. \"I don't think it quite does the trick.\"Harpsviken keeps a list of \"possible and confirmed nominations,\" based on public announcements and his own sources. His list this year includes WikiLeaks as well as Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of leaking material to the website.Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva, Afghan human rights advocate Sima Samar, and several rights groups including U.S.-based Wings of Hope and Cuban opposition movement Damas de Blanco are also on the list.His own top guess is Russian rights group Memorial, followed by activists Leymah Gbowee of Liberia and Ory Okolloh of Kenya.The committee will announce the winner in October.Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Mehdi says Google's sting, in fact, was \"rigged to manipulate Bing search results\" through the use of click fraud -- the elaborate trickery scammers use to fake clicks on Web ads in order to get paid by advertisers.\"What does all this cloak-and-dagger click fraud prove?\" asks Mehdi. \"Nothing anyone in the industry doesn't already know.\"Google senior engineer Amit Singhal told Technology Live that the search giant stands by its original allegations that Bing is a copy cat.\"At Google we strongly believe in innovation,\" says Singhal. \"We look forward to competing with genuinely new search algorithm built on core innovation, and not on recycled search results copied from a competitor.\"In an exclusive Technology Live interview, Bing Director Stefan Weitz elaborated on why Microsoft contends Google is the real cheater in this confrontation:TL: So Google really blindsided you with this?Weitz: It was a surprise, not so much the stunt itself. I was more surprised by the fact that it isn't intellectually honest. It's just not true.TL: So what was manipulated?Weitz: What Google did was clever, I'll give them that. They basically took a bunch of nonsensical words, like xlgr493, and then modified their own algorithm to point the search query for that particular word to a real site. So xlgr493 refers to kittycat.com.Then about 20 of them went to their houses at night, and, probably over a glass of merlot, started using the Bing toolbar to query Google for that particular nonsensical word. Then the next day they showed that if you searched for that nonsensical word on Bing, the faked site would appear as the first result.TL: And the first Bing result would be the same as the first Google result for the same nonsensical word?Weitz: Yes. Google's engineers basically issued a bunch of queries to Google from the Bing toolbar for that nonsensical word. They already had tuned the Google search engine to display a certain link when it saw that nonsensical word. By using the Bing toolbar, and then clicking on that link, the data flowed through normal processes back to Microsoft as it should. From there the data gets analyzed against a thousand different signals, one of which is our ranker. There is no copying here at all.TL: So the sting was set up knowing only your ranking signal would trigger, not any of the others?Weitz: There were no other signals, nothing else to look up. They artificially created this association, and there was nothing else we could use to figure out what the user was asking for. So we pulled that one signal, which was the faked one from Google.TL: Do you take this as evidence that Google will get more down and dirty about defending its turf now that Larry Page is replacing Eric Schmidt as CEO?Weitz: At the end of the day, we're all a bunch of geeks competing, right. Everyone's competing hard and that's actually good for the users because, in the end, they get a great product."},
