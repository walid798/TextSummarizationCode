Any good?\r\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\r\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\r\nClara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\r\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\r\nClara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\r\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\r\nNeela: How's that?\r\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\r\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\r\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\r\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!\r\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\r\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.\r\nClara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\r\nNeela: See ya, love!\r\nClara: Bye!",

Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \r\nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\r\nBetty: Why is that?\r\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\r\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\r\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\r\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\r\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\r\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\r\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \r\nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\r\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \r\nBetty: So what would you recommend?\r\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \r\nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \r\nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\r\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\r\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \r\nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\r\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \r\nBetty: That would be great.
