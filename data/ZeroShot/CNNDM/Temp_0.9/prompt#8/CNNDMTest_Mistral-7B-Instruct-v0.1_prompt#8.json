        "text": "'Insta-fame' is the latest criterion for models wanting to book jobs, according to leading Australian modelling agencies. While being beautiful, fit and healthy is expected, it's all about a demand for the 'influencer' now. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, in order for modelling agencies to keep up with client demand, 'influencer' and 'blogger' divisions are now being added to their traditional model portfolio. General manager of Vivien's Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an 'influencers' section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers. Scroll down for video . Influencer: Gigi Hadid is one of many in-demand models whose social media following is as much a draw card as her good looks for clients booking her on jobs . Self-made model: Mimi Elashiry turned her social media following into a modelling career . Big on Instagram: Elashiry has almost 700,000 followers . 'Our bookers  were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said. 'Now when we\u2019re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.' McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers. 'It\u2019s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 'So if models are getting up to that, they might get added to our 'Influencer' page.' Joseph Tenni of Chadwick Models told News.com.au that 'It\u2019s not unusual for a client to ask \u201chow many followers does she have?\u201d before they ask what they look like.' Chic Management also started a 'blogger' management division two years ago. Of influencer: Prestigious model agency Vivien's has introduced an 'Influencer' page noting their models' social media stats . 'That line of just being a model is being blurred': Bloggers and influencers are now being snapped up by agencies capitalising on their following . General Manager Paul Thomas says it's now where all the money is being spent, with clients seeking hard and fast brand promotion. 'If you  think about it, your brand can send their product straight to someone's pocket rather than printing a catalogue in store and waiting for a customer go collect it.' Thomas told Daily Mail Australia it's all about the elusive 'cool girl' appeal. 'Influencers are like a captain of the ship - because there is so much information out there, people turn to models, fashion people and talent and begin liking what they are liking.' 'We do have clients that  book in a traditional sense, but new up-and-coming brands want a \u2018cool girl\u2019 with vast social numbers that they can book a campaign off the back of the model's social media,' he said. It's this combination of 'cool girl' meets followers and a 'lust-have' lifestyle that Thomas said is really drawing in clients, and models are now being trained how to self-promote on their Instagram to get work. International: American Alexis Ren has over 1.6million followers, and is in demand Down Under as much for her looks as her army of followers . 'Now that line of just being a model is being blurred, people want to know about the model but it's got to be organic, you can smell when it\u2019s all a bit too staged,' he said. Thomas said health and fitness is very 'on brand' at the moment, so that's something the girls are encouraged to promote, which most of them naturally will as they stay in shape. 'With new faces we sit down with them and do social media training, to make sure those girls are representing us as well. We don\u2019t need them to be serious posters, just once or twice a day, or one every day.' Chic manage American model Alexis Ren, who has over 1.6 million followers and has shot previous campaigns for Australian label General Pants. 'She has\u00a01.6 million followers, a  huge following in Australia, her boyfriend is this amazingly good looking surfie and her Instagram is a mood board that makes you want to be on holidays with them.' Thomas said it's a coup for Australian brands because she is not only 5\u20198, beautiful and blonde  but  she is 'insta-famous', has an increase of 45,000 followers per week and has a boyfriend with almost a million followers, so they have the tools they need to sell her as a talent. Chic Management also says bloggers like Sarah Donaldson from Harper and Harley and Brooke Testoni have scored major campaigns with Oral B and Pandora  based on their social outreach and style.",

Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals \u2013 ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it \u2013 were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: \u2018Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I\u2019ve ever seen before. \u2018I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. \u2018It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . \u2018There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.\u2019 According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera\u2019s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. \u2018I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,\u2019 he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.",

The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open . Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week . But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open. 'It is difficult to win everything all the time. Djokovic was as good then in 2011 as he is now. He had an impeccable year in 2011 as well as he is having in 2015. I have to congratulate him. Djokovic is World No 1 and in superb form, but Nadal insists he has no worries about Roland Garros . The Spaniard is looking to win a sixth consecutive French Open, and a tenth in total . 'The rest of the players have to accept that at the moment he is the world number one with all he has achieved this year,' added Nadal, who has had a patchy year after making his comeback in January following another lengthy injury and illness break. 'This year I have to do things right, get back to a very high level to face him on the court,' Nadal said. 'Tennis-wise, I feel a lot better than a few weeks ago. I am going to try to get as far as I can and to play as well as I can, topping the level I showed in Monte Carlo.' Nadal admits that Djokovic will be the man to beat, but says this year will be no different to previous ones .",

        "text": "Rocker Richie Sambora is being investigated by police over claims he 'threatened to kill' his former fashion designer lover. The ex Bon Jovi guitarist, 55, allegedly told former business partner Nikki Lund he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her', Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. Sambora is said to have made the chilling threat during a blazing telephone argument on March 19. His shaken former flame decided to report the allegation to authorities a week later. Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of \u00a0LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Two of the teens, 18 and 19, have been released \"pending further inquiries,\" Australia's Federal Police said. Sevdet Besim, 18, was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The person charged Monday is accused of conspiring to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. \"The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,\" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the \"Daesh death cult,\" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic. It's a handle ISIS is known to loathe.

Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28, developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for years. But true  happiness eventually found the shy Brazilian - who has come to be known as 'the gentle giant' - in the form of Evem Medeiros, a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online. Scroll down for video . Half his size: Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28 (right), who at 7ft 8in tall has come to be known as 'the gentle giant', married Evem Medeiros (left), a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online . 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size.' The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life. 'I get asked a lot about this and at first it annoyed me but nowadays it's normal and I am used to it. I take it in good humour,' explained the real-life Goliath. 'Some people like to talk about my shoe size and then imagine how big my member might be. 'I think the size of my feet is false advertising. Our love life is normal. We adapt. Lying down everyone is my size.' Happier times: Joelison developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for year . Joelison grew up in a small rural village in Paraiba, northern Brazil and was bullied from a young age due to his height. He got in trouble for fighting his tormentors and later decided to quit school altogether, much to the disappointment of his mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45. She said: 'From a young age I knew there was something not quite right with Joelison. 'When he was a baby and only a few months old the baby shoes stopped fitting his feet properly and I'd always have to go and buy more and more. 'I thought \"there\u2019s something wrong here\" but the doctors said he was just a big baby and would stop growing eventually and so we waited for him to stop growing - but he still hasn\u2019t stopped. True love: 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size' Joelison's mother added: 'When he got to eight years old I knew he was growing at an abnormal rate and by the time he was 14 he was already 6ft 4in. 'We lived in the rural zone and nobody knew him. For half of his life he had been hidden away. If anyone came to our house he was so shy he would hide so they wouldn\u2019t see him. 'I was really worried.' Doctors later discovered he had a benign tumour on his pituitary gland that was causing his body to produce uncontrolled amounts of growth hormone. Joelison initially refused to have it removed as he didn't want to spend three months in hospital recovering, even though he was warned it would eventually kill him. But in 2007, after some convincing from his family, he agreed and had it removed using less invasive laser surgery performed through his nose. The successful operation helped slow his growth but he still sprouted another four inches to his current height of 7ft 8in. Long and the short of it: The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life, which he says they have 'adapted to' With the gigantism under control, Joelison's confidence grew. The computer games fan finally took a step into the public conscience and was eventually crowned Brazil's tallest man. One TV show took such pity on his plight they made him seven pairs of shoes to fit his enormous size 23 shoe size and custom shirts and shorts to fit his bulky frame. Joelison, who used to work in a gold mine as well as a plantation before leaving due to his health issues, now makes a living appearing in commercials for frozen ready meals. As a celebrity in his homeland he began to attract admirers, including new wife Evem. She contacted him on Facebook to wish him happy birthday and they swapped numbers before starting a committed relationship two months later. Mum: Joelison's mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45 (left), admits she's found it hard to adjust to her son's wife, claiming, 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him' 'She was basically my first woman. The first woman of my life. I was 28,' said Joelison. 'I thought everything about her was beautiful - but especially her eyes. 'She is very caring. She doesn't show it when the cameras are here but she is caring and truthful. She has never lied to me.' Just a year later they were married and it didn't take them long to start trying for a family. But Evem, who hopes to find work as a hair stylist, was initially wary of getting intimate. 'I had a certain amount of fear,' she said. 'I was afraid it wouldn't work out. But it was fine. We have a normal love life.' She added: 'We want to have a family so I track my dates, times, temperature, everything. All I have to do is call him and he understands what is going on. 'I have polycystic ovaries and so there are months that I don't ovulate. I've done my exams and already know that my condition makes it more difficult to get pregnant. 'But he hasn't done his tests so we need him to go and do it so we can see if the problem really is just me.' Joelison and Evem are currently trying to start a family, but having difficulty due to Evem's polycystic ovaries . Aside from family planning they also struggle to work together on basic chores like cooking, cleaning and shopping as Joelison's height makes it tough for him to stand up for long periods of time. His new relationship has also caused friction with his mother, who is finding it hard to let him have his independence after 28 years. She said: 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him and when I had to share him with someone else it really wasn\u2019t easy. But as a mother I want him to be happy. 'With his treatment, I\u2019m still the one who takes care of that, I haven\u2019t delegated it to that girl yet. 'But I will once she gets used to things.' Joelison still has monthly injections and four types of daily medication to control his condition and is likely to need even more care as he gets older. However, he has still plans to fulfil many of his dreams, including having a family and travelling abroad. He also finally finished his high-school education last year after studying at home.

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either \u2018incredibly naive or totally incompetent\u2019 by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank\u2019s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for \u2018a further one-year period\u2019 before leaving the bank\u2019s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that \u2018no decision has been taken at this time\u2019. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: \u2018You should think about resigning.

Mrs Fairhead suggested that \u2018frontline\u2019 staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank\u2019s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: \u2018We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.\u2019 But Mrs Hodge responded that to \u2018simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose\u2019.

The disgraced ESPN sports reporter has been suspended for a week since footage emerged showing her unleash a vicious verbal attack on a single mother-of-three at a towing firm. Her car had been towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Virginia, where she left it overnight on Easter Weekend. When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She\u2019s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she\u2019s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding:\u00a0'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed\u00a0magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to\u00a0suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence. 'We have provided guidance to both clubs on the matter, and advised Carlisle United of our own stance that if any fans do choose to 'black up' they should be refused entry to their stadium. Kick It Out have urged Carlisle to refuse entry to any fans who decide to black up for the fixture . 'We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have received from Hartlepool United supporters. 'If we do receive complaints informing us that supporters have 'blacked up' at the fixture between Carlisle United and Hartlepool United, or that any incidents or disturbances of a discriminatory nature have occurred, we will follow our usual procedures by making the Football Association and the Football League aware for them to investigate.' Neither Carlisle nor Hartlepool were immediately available for comment but Carlisle boss Keith Curle told the local News & Star at a press conference this week: 'I've been to fancy dress parties when white people have dressed up as Bob Marley.

Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth\u2019s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday\u2019s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth\u2019s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: \u2018It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, \u201cDon\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\u2019t want them to have any more\u201d.\u2019 Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his\u00a036th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth\u2019s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham \u2014 the only goal of the match \u2014 Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. \u2018No-one will blame Adam,\u2019 Howe said. \u2018We will tell him how much we love him tonight.\u2019 Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt \u2018heartbroken\u2019. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs \u00a31 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth\u2019s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. \u2018He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,\u2019 he said. \u2018We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.\u2019 But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of \u00a3120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It\u2019s crazy but it\u2019s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .",

        "text": "A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based\u00a0Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post\u00a0was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I\u2019m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects \u2013 including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video\u00a0Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn\u2019t had [my friend\u2019s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly\u00a0visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

        "text": "A former mob enforcer in Rhode Island with ties to late New England crime boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca has died in a federal prison in North Carolina. Gerard T. 'The Frenchman' Ouimette was 75. The Federal Bureau of Prison's website reported that Ouimette, who had lived in Fall River, Massachusetts, died Sunday. Ouimette, suspected of having a role in up to eight murders, 'ran' the federal prison in North Carolina in the 1970s and even had booze, drugs and lobster dinner smuggled in on a weekly basis, according to a Rhode Island State Police report. His nephew, Kevin Ouimette Lynch, tells the Providence Journal that his uncle was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and died in his sleep at a prison in Butner, North Carolina. Ouimette was reportedly in control of a gangster network responsible for gambling, loansharking, extortion, and murder, among other crimes . Ouimette passed away in this medium security facility after being diagnosed with lung cancer . In 1996, Ouimette was convicted of extortion and became the first criminal in New England sentenced to life in prison under the federal 'three strikes and you're out' provision for violent offenders. Ouimette had more than 10 convictions during his criminal career, including one for punching an FBI agent. The Providence Journal\u00a0reports that Ouimette spent a total of 46 years behind bars. A 1979 FBI document regarding his background paints the picture of man in control of a massive underworld network. 'Subject OUIMETTE controls a large group of criminals known as the OUIMETTE faction, whose criminal activities include gambling, loansharking, extortion and property violations such as major hijackings, robberies and burglaries,' the report states. Ouimette had close ties to crime boss Raymond Patriarca, seen here leaving a federal building in Boston on June 27, 1967. 'Although not Italian, OUIMETTE enjoys the same stature as lieutenants under RAYMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, who controls organized crime (OC) in the Boston and New England area.' The document went on to call Ouimette responsible for 'seven of eight gangland-style murders.' He was never convicted of any homicides, however. Ouimette was known to his associates as 'The Frenchman.' In his 2012 memoir, 'What Price Providence,' the enforcer blamed the police for the nickname. ''The Frenchman' is the name that Rhode Island police attached to me in 1969 since I am proud of my French descent, an anomaly in that neighborhood,' he wrote. 'Due to ensuing notoriety, the name stuck.' In the introduction to that back, he wrote that he knew he would die in prison.

'Bottom line is, if you can survive, you're ahead of the game, not by much, but by some. The reason is, there is no room for error when you are playing the La Costra Nostra's major leagues; one mistake can end your life, and often does.' The gangland enforcer's influence was not diminished behind bars, and state police said he even became the boss of the ACI's maxium security prison in the 1970s.

They even had catered lobster dinners, police said. Ouimette, then 55, is seen here being escorted out of Federal Court in Providence, Rhode Island, after being sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 . Besides booze, Ouimette even once had his son, then only five-years-old, smuggled into the prison for a sleepover, the Journal reported. Eventually he and Kennedy had a falling out, and Kennedy claimed a hit squad was assembled to kill him.

His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs \u2013 a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of \u2018We\u2019re rich but our team is s***\u2019 and \u2018Where\u2019s the money gone?\u2019 in protest at Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million and later revealed they have \u00a334m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. \u2018I can understand why fans are frustrated,\u2019 said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. \u2018It\u2019s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there\u2019s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they\u2019ve been. They think \u201cWhere else can I make money? Oh a football club\u201d. \u2018I\u2019ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it\u2019s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books - he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. \u2018Now it\u2019s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why he wants to own a football club.\u2019 Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club\u2019s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . \u2018I think you\u2019ve got to get the balance right. It\u2019s not just about making money,\u2019 he said. \u2018Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn\u2019t care what the fans thought.

        "text": "Two men who claim they were molested as young boys by Michael Jackson are expected to find out on Tuesday if they will be allowed to sue  for a slice of the late King Of Pop's $1.5 billion estate. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once the singer's staunchest defender, now claims Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has scheduled a hearing for Robson and another of Jackson's alleged child victims, James Safechuck, on Tuesday that could decide if their respective claims proceed. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once Michael Jackson's staunchest defender, now claims the singer was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . Robson and Safechuck missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death. If Judge Beckloff gives Robson, 32, and Safechuck, 36, a green light to proceed with their civil claim, new child molestation allegations will likely be revealed in court against Jackson. Lawyers say the King Of Pop shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims, reports the New York Post. The Jordan Chandler lawsuit alone is alleged to have cost more than $40 million. Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride. Safechuck alleges the singer gave him a marriage certificate and a wedding band as keepsakes and confirmation of their 'undying love'. He also alleges that Jackson wrote a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck's father, a sanitation worker. James Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride . 'Jackson was successful in his efforts to the point that my client endured repeated acts of sexual abuse of a heinous nature and was brainwashed... into believing they were acts of love and \u00adinstigated by James himself,' Safechuck's attorneys said in the \u00adfilings. The singer regularly dressed Safe\u00adchuck in clothes identical to his and would tell reporters Safechuck was his cousin, a former employee said. Safechuck's attorney alleges that Jackson molested Safechuck more than 100 times. Robson was a five-year-old dance prodigy in Brisbane, Australia, when he first met the singer. Prior to filing his civil lawsuit in 2013 he had been one of the pop star's biggest supporters, including testifying under oath at Jackson's 2005 molestation trial in California he was never abused by Jackson. Robson was a key reason for Jackson's acquittal. He now says he 'lived in silence and denial for 22 years' and alleges he was seven years old when Jackson first molested him. Former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, left, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw them semi-nude in bed together . Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. A former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw Jackson and Robson semi-nude in bed together, the Post reports. The estate has previously asked the court to reject the claims on the basis that Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. Robson, a choreographer for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, says he has been unable to work because of the pain caused by Jackson's abuse. Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.",

Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of \u00a323,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of \u00a323,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to \u00a39,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was \u00a323,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have\u00a0travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a \u00a3550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently \u00a37.60. But this is still far less than the \u00a319.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding \u00a343,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.",

They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused:\u00a0Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that\u2019s not where a large portion of the investors\u2019 money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D.

Slinking back into public view:\u00a0Nicolas Sarkozy is driven to court where he faces charges\u00a0over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country - two days after being heralded as France's saviour . Thierry Herzog, the lawyer of the former French President and current head of the right-wing UMP opposition party, arrives at the Pole Financier headquarters (the fraud section of the courthouse) in Paris . Not only was he roundly beaten by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, but he is alleged to have got the UMP party to pay off his personal fine approaching \u00a3500,000 for over-spending. Under French electoral law, Sarkozy should have paid the fine himself from his own funds. On Sunday, his party made massive electoral gains against the Socialists in regional elections, and Sarkozy is convinced he can become president again in 2017. After the UMP won 66 out of 101 departments - the French equivalent of counties - Sarkozy announced: 'The French have massively rejected the policies of Francois Hollande and his government. 'Hope has been reborn in France.' Happier outing: On Sunday, Sarkozy's party made massive electoral gains against the Socialists in regional elections and he is convinced he can become president again in 2017 . Under pressure: France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections at the weekend - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' But his former lieutenant Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cope has already been charged in the funding case and Sarkozy could suffer the same fate today. It will add to a long list of corruption scandals, which started for Sarkozy as soon as he lost his presidential immunity from prosecution. Within days of leaving the Elysee Palace in 2012, the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by police. He is facing criminal charges in numerous cases, including an investigation into more than \u00a315million of false billing by Bygmalion, an events-organising company, during the 2012 campaign. It has also been alleged that Sarkozy's successful 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator. Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing in any of the cases against him. He refused to speak to reporters before arriving in court at 8am today and is expected to spend most of the day in a closed sitting with judges.",

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

A thief who tricked his way into students' homes to steal their belongings was caught when he left his old police charge sheet behind which had his name written on it. Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as a university maintenance engineer to gain access to students' properties before pinching laptops and mobile phones to feed his drug habit. But a court heard he was easily tracked down by police after he left behind his bag at the scene of one of the crimes. Officers searched the rucksack and found it contained a police charge sheet from a previous offence bearing his name and address. The prolific thief was arrested last Friday, and has now been sentenced to four years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five burglaries. The court heard unemployed Woolaston would walk around the University of Birmingham campus wearing clothes bearing the red-brick university's logo. But he was caught out when he broke into the Biosciences Department on January 29 where he forced open two secure metal cupboards. Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit. However, Woolaston was caught after breaking into the University's bio-sciences lab and leaving behind a bag containing a previous police charge sheet, with his name and address written on it . 'He wore a University of Birmingham top and pretended to be a maintenance engineer in order to enter the student flats and steal electrical goods. 'Unfortunately for him, Woolaston managed to leave vital evidence behind at one of the break-ins, and we are grateful to vigilant students who were able to identify him for further burglaries. 'Woolaston was charged with a total of five offences, and asked for a further five burglaries to be taken into consideration. We are happy with his sentence.'",

However despite the fox\u2019s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide \u2018with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day\u2019s photography.\u2019 However Mr Byng\u2019s relaxing day\u2019s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. \u2018I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,\u2019 explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. \u2018I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.\u2019 Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. \u2018The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. \u2018It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. \u2018Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . \u2018It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. \u2018The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!\u2019 The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK.

        "text": "Caller ID as we know it could be getting a revamp. Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers. Scroll down for video . Facebook has launched a new app called Hello (pictured) designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers . The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US. It is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful. 'Billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who\u2019s calling them,' explained Facebook's product manager Andrea Vaccari in a blog post. Facebook has tweaked its News Feed setting to make posts from friends more prominent. The rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends. Content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up  in News Feed so they are less likely to miss it. The latest update will also make posts and Pages that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down. Facebook said: 'The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. 'This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses. 'This balance is different for everyone [and] as more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right.' 'Today we are starting to test Hello, a new app built by the Messenger team. 'Hello connects with Facebook so you can see who\u2019s calling, block unwanted calls and search for people and places.' When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who\u2019s calling, even if they don\u2019t have that number saved. Users will only see information that people have already shared on Facebook, and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app's downfall. Callers must also have a Facebook account in order for the data to be shared but they don't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call. They also don't need to have Hello installed, either. Another feature of Hello includes making it easier to block unwanted calls. From the settings menu in Hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers. This is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers, for example, and blocked calls go straight to voicemail. When a user receives a call Hello shows them info about who\u2019s calling, even if they don\u2019t have that number saved (pictured left). Hello also makes it easier to block unwanted calls and see which numbers have been blocked from other users (pictured right) in the app's settings menu . The list of blocked calls can also be reviewed in the recent calls list. If a call is made and the number isn't linked to a Facebook account,  Hello simply shows the number like a traditional caller ID. However, if other users have blocked this number the number of times it has been blocked is also shown. Elsewhere, when users search for people and businesses on Facebook they can call them with  one tap when Hello is installed. And in the case of searching for businesses, Hello will also show opening hours and web addresses where possible, on the user's screen.",

        "text": "(CNN)The night before her daughter's first triathlon, Kate Parker could tell the child was nervous. Ella and her younger sister, Alice, are athletic, loud, curious, wild-haired kids. They grew up watching their mother compete in races and Ella had asked to sign up for her own. Still, as they laid out everything she'd need the next day, Parker, a photographer, could tell she was afraid. \"Why don't we get a picture?\" Parker asked Ella, now 9. \"Show me your strongest face, show me your bravest face, even if you don't feel that way right now.\" As she pulled the image up on her screen, she got chills from her daughter's direct stare. She looked, Parker said, like \"a little badass.\" \"You're going to be totally fine,\" Parker showed her. \"Look at how tough you are.\" The next day, Ella participated in her race, and loved it. Looking back, \"I wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it, sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear, \" said Parker, who lives near Atlanta. \"As a mom, I really wanted to get a good picture of it, too.\" The photo is one of Parker's favorites from her series, \"Strong is the New Pretty.\" It covers the last two years, but evolved from Parker's early days behind a camera, when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition. It seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows, forced smiles and Photoshop-smooth skin. Hers didn't. \"I didn't want to shoot pictures like that. I didn't want girls to think they had to look like that,\" said Parker, whose daughters are now 6 and 9. \"Whoever they were, however they were, was worthy of an image. Whatever they were was good enough.\" So, she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled, muddy, screaming, laughing, jumping in the pool, collecting worms in the creek, barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles. \"I want to capture them before they lose that sense of 'I'm so awesome.' I wanted them to keep that as long as they could,\" Parker said. \"I started to shoot with that in mind, but it was already there.\" The girls pose for an occasional portrait, but most are kid-inspired moments, shaped by childish wonderment and energy. As parents, Parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside, make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass-stained knees and knots in their hair, Parker said. Now, the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own. \"They're just being themselves, and I'm just recording it,\" Parker said. Responses to the images are mostly positive, Parker said, but there's the occasional complaint that she's showing just one type of girl. It's true, Parker said: They're the ones she's raising, the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7. She hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children's lives. More important, she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be. Parker's own kids still surprise her. \"Alice is a beautiful singer. When I hear her sing, it makes me cry,\" Parker said. \"Ella has this amazing, kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win. It's something that I did not teach her. \"Whatever it is, it's OK.\"",

        "text": "A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by\u00a0Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing\u00a0Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought \"you're not gay, you're transgender.\"' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections.

'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said.

She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying;\u00a0'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.'

        "text": "Ferrari technical director James Allison believes Mercedes are again likely to lead the way in China this weekend. Fears of another season of domination from Mercedes were blown away by a shock, yet deserved victory for Sebastian Vettel last time out in Malaysia. It was the Maranello marque's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg will not have it all their own way. Sebastian Vettel won the second race of the season with victory in Malaysia last month . Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . In searing heat and high track temperatures the Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen were far kinder on their tyres, stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for Hamilton and Rosberg. This weekend's race at the Shanghai International Circuit, however, should favour Mercedes given the cooler climes than that of Sepang. Allison is certainly not expecting back-to-back Ferrari wins and said: 'Our car has a pretty decent cooling package. 'That allowed us to operate in the fierce temperatures like we experienced in Malaysia without having to open up the car. 'The track was also rough and hot, which is hard for tyres, and we're fortunate the car goes well on its tyres. Hamilton celebrates his win in Australia . 'Quite what problems were going on in Merc-land I don't know. 'But I'm fairly sure we will have our work cut out in China to do as impressive a job as we did in Malaysia.' As to whether Ferrari can stay the course with Mercedes and provide a season-long challenge, for now that is too difficult to determine. 'I don't know about that. I'll tell you at the end of the season,' remarked Allison with a smile. 'In Melbourne (the season-opening Australian Grand Prix) Mercedes were very, very dominant, and we were better than we looked. 'Even in free air we wouldn't have held a candle to them there. 'There is a lot of work for us to do before we can head into every race weekend confident we can hunt for the victory from the first session of that weekend. 'But we do have a fairly exciting development plan, and we've a lot of performance to bring. 'It should at least be an interesting season to see if we can close that gap so we are genuine contenders at any weekend.' Crucially, and what may yet be a determining factor, Allison added: 'Normally over the course of a season being kind to your tyres is the best thing you can be.'",

The former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other. Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says Knight was transported to a hospital from the downtown courthouse. She says no further details could be released. Scroll down for video . 'Suge' Knight, pictured above on April 8, will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges following a hit-and-run, an LA judge said on Thursday . The parents of Suge Knight (pictured left) and his girlfriend (right) comfort each other outside the Los Angeles courthouse after learning on Thursday that he will stand trial for murder . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling on Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle 'Bone' Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand in Los Angeles county. The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million.\u00a0On Thursday morning, Knight walked out of court after the hearing. A message sent to Knight\u2019s attorney Matt Fletcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned. Sloan told detectives that he attacked Knight but testified on Monday that he didn't remember the fight and did not want to be a 'snitch'. Prosecutors played Sloan's statement to police, which offered a lucid, detailed account of the events on January 29 that led up to the deadly encounter. Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55. Suge Knight's parents seen leaving the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday after a judge ruled that their son will stand trial for murder and attempted murder . Victim Terry Carter's eldest daughter seen leaving court with attorney Carl Douglas after the announcement that Marion Suge Knight will stand trial for murder and attempted murder on Thursday . Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, said his client was ambushed and was trying to escape Sloan's attack when he ran over the men. Sloan's testimony demonstrated the difficulty in prosecuting Knight, who has gang ties and a reputation for intimidating witnesses. 'I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison,' Sloan testified, adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed. Prosecutors granted Sloan, a former gang member who's known Knight for decades, limited immunity after he said he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. Sloan, an adviser on the upcoming film 'Straight Outta Compton,' said he was trying to forget details of the crash, in which he suffered two fractured ankles, a serious cut to his head, two torn knee ligaments and a shoulder injury. 'Every day, I try to forget it,' Sloan said. 'I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead.' Sloan's memory troubles prompted the judge to comment on his testimony: 'I find that this witness is being deceptive.' The judge also heard from the lead detective investigating the case and watched security camera footage of the crash. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - \u00a0at one hearing in March, a medical condition sent him to the hospital . The camera caught a limited view of the parking lot but shows Knight struggling with Sloan through the window of his truck before putting the vehicle in reverse, striking Sloan, then hitting him again and running over Carter while fleeing the scene. Fletcher, Knight's attorney, pressed Sloan on his feelings toward Knight and whether he was 'enraged' at him on the day of the crash. Sloan said he was mad but disputed that he told detectives he was enraged. Fletcher also painted Sloan as the aggressor, saying Knight 'hadn't attacked you in any form, fashion or manner. You agree?' 'Yes,' Sloan said. Knight faces up to life in prison if convicted in the case. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. Knight pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years' probation in an assault on two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992. The rap figure was sentenced to prison in February 1997 for violating terms of that probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car near the Strip. Shakur's slaying remains unsolved. Prosecutors only had to present a fraction of their evidence against Knight during the preliminary hearing that began on Monday. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances. He complained earlier this month when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court. 'No snitch': Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 45, (left, file photo) told the court that he 'will not be used to send Suge Knight  to prison'.

Villagers in the small country hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich in Cheshire, had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could 'intimidate' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings. But yesterday, Cheshire East Council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting, which will create a 'transit site' with room for nine gipsy families. The 200-year-old Cledford Hall in the small hamlet of Cledford in Cheshire which is being knocked down to make way for a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp costing \u00a33.2million . People living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners . The mansion's Grade-II listed adjoining barn will be converted into 'washing and toilet' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers. The cost of the project, revealed through a Freedom of Information request, has left locals stunned, and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area. Formerly Grade II-listed Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled. It will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on. Around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to \u2018unauthorised encampments\u2019. The \u00a33.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a Freedom of Information request and got the go ahead yesterday by Cheshire East Council . Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its Grade-II listing was cancelled . Builder Bob Moody, 66, bought a \u2018dream\u2019 retirement cottage with his wife Trisha, 61, and has spent \u00a3130,000 renovating it with original Victorian fittings. It now lies, almost finished, at the site\u2019s entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose \u00a3100,000 if it is put on the market. He said: 'We\u2019re totally gutted. We\u2019re not going to live there now. Can we sell it? It\u2019s going to be so hard to sell. We honestly don\u2019t know what to do. 'Most of my life savings have gone into this cottage. Do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it? Would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site? 'We were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety, as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations. Builder Bob Moody at the gates to the site with local residents Ken Roden and George Beevers. He says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting . Mr Moody beside the house he bought in Cledford as a retirement home. He is refusing to move into the property\u00a0and fears he could lose \u00a3100,000 if it is put on the market . 'If they have to be three metres apart they may have to reduce the number of caravans. That means they could be spending up to \u00a35million to accommodate six to eight families. It\u2019s ludicrous. 'These types of transit families in Cheshire can be obstructive, they may fight with police, defecate in hedges, leave rubbish everywhere. These are not the sort of neighbours that OAPs want opposite them.' At the planning meeting, the strategic planning board of Cheshire East Council had eight votes in favour of the site, with one against. Three members abstained from voting. Residents also raised concerns that the new site would destroy local wildlife which had settled on the site of Cledford Hall, including grass snakes, hedgehogs and toads. A planning permission sign next to Cledford Hall. Cheshire East Council say the development is needed to house travellers in the area . Mr Moody added: 'None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin\u2019s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside. 'There could be a minimum of between 80 and 100 gypsies and travellers at any time. Some may be very pleasant and law abiding, but you will always get the few who aren\u2019t. 'They are only allowed to stay for 28 days so you can\u2019t form a relationship with these people. If we get the odd ones that fight and get drunk and cause trouble it will be very intimidating.' Mr Moody explained he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting. He added: 'I\u2019m going to talk to a lawyer to see if there is any way we can get compensation. 'It is the direct action of Cheshire East Council that has lost me nearly \u00a3100,000 and I can\u2019t recover that cost. 'This has totally ruined my retirement and retirement plans. I haven\u2019t set a date for my retirement now because our dream was to go to our little idyllic comfortable country cottage in the fields of Cheshire and that\u2019s been shattered now.' Building work on the site is due to go ahead in the near future since the passing of the final stage of the application. Councillor Don Stockton, head of housing and jobs for Cheshire East Council who lives in the nearby town of Alderley Edge and was part of the applying team, said: 'We need a site somewhere in Cheshire East as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them. 'This is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough. It is very difficult to get these things sited and there has been plenty of public opposition. 'I know there has been a lot of public angst and people haven\u2019t liked it but I\u2019m afraid that is going to be the case wherever you would wish to put a transit site. 'I do feel sorry for the nearby residents. I think if the site was on my doorstep it\u2019s just a case if wherever these things are sited it is bound to have opposition. 'It wouldn\u2019t matter whether it was next to my house or anyone\u2019s house. With the best will in the world we have to try and pick the best site possible. 'It\u2019s just inevitable there is opposition and I\u2019m very sorry for those who have a problem with that.

With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from \u00a364 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs.

But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. \"The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,\" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. \"We know how to address disease when we find it.\" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus \"low\" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. \"That said, human infections have occurred\" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. \"We are cautiously optimistic\" that it won't spread to humans, but \"we are prepared for the possibility,\" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called \"torticollis\" or \"stargazing\" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA. So the cases should go down over the summer, but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the Fall.",

The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus \"low,\" but human infections have occurred.

Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However,\u00a0ABC News reports that\u00a0South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . \u2018I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,\u2019 he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. \u2018That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.\u2019 The 38-year-old was captured\u00a0streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman\u2019s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said\u00a0Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I \u00a0always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.",

The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents\u00a0a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, \"Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,\"' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS.\u00a0A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.",

        "text": "Veteran Burnley defender Michael Duff believes manager Sean Dyche could one day take charge of England. Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players.

'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 . The high point of Burnley's season, so far, is the 1-0 defeat of defending champions Manchester City .",
        "generated": "Burnley defender Michael Duff believes that manager Sean Dyche could one day take charge of the England national team, stating that he has learned a lot from the former Chesterfield defender and has a high respect for his managerial abilities. With eight games remaining in the season, Burnley is fighting for survival in the Premier League, but Duff is optimistic about their chances and hopes that Dyche will stay with the club beyond his current contract. Additionally, Duff has mentioned his own plans to pursue a career in management after retiring from playing.",

        "text": "A former lager lout who ballooned to 24 stone has lost nearly half his body weight by giving up his favourite drink. Rugby prop Dale Forrest, 26, of Bolton, would sink up to 12 pints a night, but decided to shed the pounds after seeing a photo of himself while out with his fitness fanatic friends. In December 2013, the bank teller decided to ditch the booze, give up his favourite fatty readymeals and greasy takeaways and hit the gym. Dale Forrest would drink up to 12 pints a night - and ballooned to 24 stone - before giving up beer to lose weight . Dale, pictured at his slimmest, was worried he would look like a 'beached whale' next to his friends on holiday . Since then, Mr Forrest, who had a holiday planned with his mates and didn\u2019t want to look like a \u2018beached whale\u2019 next to them, has lost 10.5 stone. He said: \u2018I can now go on nights out and feel confident - even without the Dutch courage. \u2018I no longer feel like people are laughing at me and all it took was a bit of willpower.\u2019 Mr Forrest struggled with his weight from a young age and in adulthood fell into unhealthy habits. Before shedding the pounds Mr Forrest ate a cheese and sausage bap for breakfast, a Big Daddy Box Meal from KFC for lunch and a meat feast pizza for dinner. Dale, pictured sitting down, said he would consume beer, alcopops and shots regularly on nights out . Dale, pictured before his weight loss (right) and after losing 10 stone, gave up greasy takeaways for healthy foods and started going to the gym regularly, and saw the pounds fall off . Despite being a rugby player, Dale weighed 24 stone due to his unhealthy lifestyle . He said: \u2018I was inactive and ate and drank what I wanted. \u2018All my friends were in really great shape. They got a lot of attention from girls and I got none, which was a bit depressing. \u2018They were all quite careful about what they ate, but I thought nothing of having dinner at McDonald's regularly.\u2019 Despite being a keen rugby player, Mr Forrest rarely exercised and lived on an unhealthy diet \u2013 and would regularly drink 12 pints of beer followed by shots and sugary alcopops on a night out with friends. He said: \u2018I would drink in the pub with my friends every Friday and Saturday. \u2018I would start off by having a few pints, then as I got a bit bloated I would switch to other drinks. By the end of the night I was downing Jaegerbombs and drinking alcopops.\u2019 After a night out in December 2013, Mr Forrest logged on to Facebook to look at the pictures taken the night before. Dale is now taking part in a charity boxing match since losing weight . Dale, pictured before (left) during a rugby game, and (right) after losing more than 10 stone . He was horrified to see that he was nearly double the size of all his friends. He said: \u2018I was shocked when I saw how big I was compared to my mates. \u2018Me and the lads had just booked a holiday for the summer and I did not want to be the beached whale at the side of the pool. \u2018I decided I had to change.\u2019 Desperate to change, Mr Forrest set his alarm for 6am the next day so he could go to the gym. He said: \u2018I had to drag myself out of bed - during the walk to the gym I felt like death and I struggled to find any motivation. \u2018When I got to the gym things changed. I started with some weights and then did 15 minutes on the crosstrainer. \u2018After I finished I felt I had achieved something, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. \u2018I got a taste for it and started going all the time.\u2019 Dale said he would start the night drinking beer and then move on to shots and alcopops . Dale (left before losing weight) turned his life around and lost more than 10 stone thanks to healthy eating . The committed slimmer also overhauled his diet, swapping fatty takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Before his dramatic weight loss Mr Forrest would snack on chocolate bars and gorge on a fat-rich diet. Now he eats porridge with blueberries for breakfast, grilled turkey with boiled potatoes and vegetables for lunch and grilled fish with green vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day he snacks on nuts, fruit, celery and protein shakes. He also started going to the gym twice a day, weightlifting before work and doing cardio in the evening. By February 2014 Mr Forrest had lost an impressive 3st 7lb. He said: \u2018The biggest change was kicking the booze. I still go out now but I've changed my drinking habits. \u2018I drink lime and soda throughout the week and I'll switch to gin and tonic on a Saturday night. \u2018Within four months people started to notice I had lost weight. My work clothes started getting really baggy as the weight fell off. \u2018It was a good feeling every time I needed to go down a size, but it cost me a fortune to keep refreshing my wardrobe.\u2019 Since losing more than ten stone, Mr Forrest has dropped from a 48-inch trouser waist to a 34-inch waist. He now weighs in at an even 14 stone. He is planning on taking part in a charity boxing match on April 18 for Cancer Research UK. He said: \u2018I've changed my lifestyle completely. It was a lot of hard work - but it is the best thing I have ever done for myself.\u2019",

'Any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us, especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week,' Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.'

'It looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week, but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we've seen last week,' Ms Westcott said. 'The difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over Sydney.' Ms Westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly. 'We might get two days of rain but it's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week,' she said. Damage and destruction caused by flooding in Stroud in the NSW Hunter region . Bureau of Meteorology NSW regional director Barry Hanstrum said: 'Early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the Northern Rivers and Mid North coasts, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. 'Current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week, and peak between Thursday and Saturday. 'Further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week\u2019s severe weather event.' The Bureau Of Meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be. Ms Wills said the SES would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible, as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit.

        "text": "Their parents came to the U.S. for opportunities and now these four teens have them in abundance. The high-achieving high schoolers  have each been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University. And as well as the Ivy League colleges, each of them has also been accepted to other top schools. While they all grew up in different cities, the students are the offspring of immigrant parents who moved to America - from Bulgaria, Somalia or Nigeria. And all four - Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana,\u00a0Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and\u00a0Harold Ekeh from New York - say they have their parents' hard work to thank. Now they hope to use the opportunities for good - whether its effecting positive social change, improving education across the world or becoming a neurosurgeon. The teens have one more thing in common: they don't know which school they're going to pick yet. The daughter of Somali immigrants who has already received a U.N. award and wants to improve education across the world . Star pupil:\u00a0Munira Khalif, from St. Paul, Minnesota, says she has always been driven by the thought that her parents, who left Somalia during the civil war, fled to the U.S. so she would have better opportunities . Munira Khalif, who attends Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, was shocked when she was accepted by eight Ivy Schools and three others - but her teachers were not. 'She is composed and she is just articulate all the time,' Randy Comfort, an upper school director at the private school, told\u00a0KMSP. 'She's pretty remarkable.' The 18-year-old student, who was born and raised in Minnesota after her parents fled Somalia during the civil war, she said she was inspired to work hard because of the opportunities her family and the U.S. had given her. 'The thing is, when you come here as an immigrant, you're hoping to have opportunities not only for yourself, but for your kids,' she told the channel. 'And that's always been at the back of my mind.' As well as achieving top grades, Khalif has immersed herself in other activities both in and out of school - particularly those aimed at doing good. She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13. Incredible: Munira, pictured speaking at Malala Day at the UN, hopes to study political science at college . High achiever:\u00a0She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13 . She launched a non-profit group, Lighting the Way, to make education more accessible for East African youth, especially girls, through scholarships, libraries and improving sanitation issues. And she was also appointed as A World at School Global Youth Ambassador to promote universal education. Khalif, who plans to study political science at college, said she has yet to decide where to go and plans to visit a few more campuses before she makes her final decision. As well as the Ivy League schools, she also received offers from Stanford, Georgetown and the University of Minnesota - and she's still letting the realization sink in. 'I was very surprised,' she said. 'I am humbled to even have the opportunity to choose amongst these schools because they are all incredible places to learn and grow.' The Bulgarian housekeeper's son who couldn't speak English a decade before he was accepted to 18 top schools in the U.S. Driven: Stefan Stoykov cried on his first day of school because he could not speak a word of English but he is now a straight-A student committed to helping other pupils with language barriers . When eight-year-old Stefan Stoykov moved from his family's one-bedroom apartment in Bulgaria to the U.S. after his parents won a green card lottery, he could not speak a word of English. 'I started crying on the first day of class,' Stefan recalled of his first day in the second grade. 'I was scared. I was scared. I didn't understand what was going on around me.' But now 18 and a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools in the world - and he admits he can hardly believe it. 'It is an incredible feeling,' Stefan told WTHR. 'I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. 'I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' But as well as getting offers from all Ivy League schools, 10 other prestigious institutions also came knocking. He has yet to decide where he will go. He revealed that hard work and the support of his mother, a housekeeper, had helped him achieve his goals. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., his parents divorced and his father took a job as a truck driver, and he has not seen him much since. Impressive: Despite his early struggles at school, he said he knew that he had to make the most of the opportunities he had been given by his parents when they moved him from Bulgaria to the U.S. 'My parents had done so much to put me in this position, to put me in the United States of America,' he said. 'And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include tutoring other students with language barriers, running the cycling club and Spirit Week and joining the stock market club, the Indy Star reported. He is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score by borrowing test guides from the library. He also helps his mother - who spent much of his childhood working so that she could support him - with her housekeeping duties so that it takes her half the time. The son of a Nigerian immigrant who dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon . Hard worker:\u00a0Victor Agbafe, 17, says he believes his Nigerian immigrant mother set a good example for him in her job as a physician. He now hopes to study\u00a0microbiology  with government or economics . Victor Agbafe, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, North Carolina, has no idea where he will attend college, but he's certain on one thing: he wants to become a neurosurgeon. The 17-year-old was accepted to 14 schools in total, including all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford and Duke. Agbafe, who plans to double major in microbiology along with government or economics, called his acceptance achievement an 'amazing opportunity', WSOC reported. Just before he played a game for his school's basketball team, he learned that Harvard had made a decision about his application - but he waited until the game was over to find out. 'I owed it my teammates to be focused there,' he said. 'I didn't want to get too low on myself if I didn't get in. I also didn't want to get too high if I was accepted.' Going places: The teenager from Wilmington, North Carolina says he plans to visit as many campuses as he can before he makes his final decision by May 1. He hopes to become a neurosurgeon . He has also been part of North Carolina's Youth and Government program, where he was chosen as Speaker of the House. He says his mother, a Nigerian immigrant and physician, set a good example for him - but she refuses to take the credit. 'For God to crown his effort with success is just something that is just beyond me,' his mother Dorothy Agbafe-Mosley said. 'I am very happy that he has all these choices to make. But then it also makes it difficult because it's a lot of good schools. A lot of good schools.' Her son will make a decision later this month after visiting as many campuses as possible. The Nigerian student who credits his Target employee parents with his success . Top student: Harold Ekeh, from Long Island, New York, has been accepted to 14 colleges in total . Ten years after his family moved him from Nigeria to the U.S., Harold Ekeh is hoping to do something for them in return. The 18-year-old Long Islander was accepted by 14 colleges - including all Ivy League schools - and now hopes to study neuroscience to cure Alzheimer's, the disease his grandmother suffers from. The straight-A student at Elmont Memorial High School secured an SAT score of 2270. He also worked as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. But he wasn't expecting to get into so many top schools.\u00a0As well as offers from the Ivy League colleges, he was also accepted by Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. 'It was crazy,' he told DailyMail.com. 'My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it.' Afterwards 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect,' he said. Devoted: He hopes to study neuroscience and find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandmother suffers from . He said it was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country,' he said. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' He said he is leaning towards going to Yale but will be visiting a few more campuses before making his decision before May 1.",

Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it.\u00a0In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying:\u00a0'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking.

        "text": "Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member \u00a0bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year,\u00a0details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party\u00a0for Tory researchers at the party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester,\u00a0funded by Conservative MPs\u2019 expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.",

        "text": "Melbourne, Australia (CNN)A man stands on a beach in a distant land. Waves lap his ankles. He wades through the gentle dawn light, arms outstretched, his head held high. He is fully dressed; not a tourist but a freedom fighter. A photograph of this man, beamed around the world, becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty. It is 2015. The man is Peter Greste. If you thought the man might have been an Anzac on the shores of Gallipoli, such is the power of persuasion. It's easy to lead a horse to water when, in the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign, our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance. The sum total of television programming, beer advertising, political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of Australia's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation: young (white) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead. Last weekend I planted Gallipoli rosemary in my backyard; part of the proceeds go to the Avenues of Honour, a national project to preserve and restore Australia's living memorials. More objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game. To widen the scope of historical tribute, and also recall the words and deeds of the Australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment, is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive. But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder. Even at the time, the Great War itself was divisive, a historical reality belied by today's bland, blanket coverage of \"the Anzac spirit\". Australia's participation in the war was contested from the outset. On August 11, 1914, veteran political campaigner Vida Goldstein wrote in her Woman Voter newspaper: \"It is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of Christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict.\" As she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage, Goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words. \"The time has come for women to show that they, as givers of life, refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter.\" Australian and New Zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate: the vote. \"The enfranchised women of Australia are political units in the British Empire,\" Goldstein argued, \"and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts.\" Goldstein's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace. Under the newly legislated War Precautions Act, the Woman Voter suffered censorship, leading Goldstein and her Women's Peace Army to fight on multiple fronts: \"We are fighting for Civil Liberty and against Military Despotism.\"  Around the nation, trade unionists opposed to \"the capitalist war\" joined the movement. Australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the Allied forces; less than 40% of eligible men signed up to fight \"for King and Country.\" As the carnage at Gallipoli brought home the realities of war, recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread. General strikes halted industry, as workers reacted to the food shortages, unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of \"the Working Man's Paradise.\" With enlistments falling away in 1916, Prime Minister Billy Hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the Unlawful Associations Act. Groups that voiced opposition to the war, like the International Workers of the World, were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material \"likely to cause disaffection or alarm\". When waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike, the War Precautions Act was invoked to send them back to work. In September 1916, the Sydney Twelve were arrested and tried for treason. \"Fifteen years for 15 words\" was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment. The conscription referendums of October 28, 1916, and December 20, 1917, became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war \u2014 or the federal government's domestic policies. There were diverse reasons for that opposition, including the anti-British sentiments of Irish Catholic Australians. In Melbourne, the meeting place for such public debate was Yarra Bank, a pocket of land nestled between what today is Birrarung Marr and the Rod Laver Arena. Anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown Yarra River. Most protest meetings were peaceful, but one became infamously violent. \"Riotous scenes at Yarra Bank\", headlines around the nation proclaimed, when a demonstration organized by the Women's Peace Army in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers. Both conscription referendums ultimately failed. The Australian Dictionary of Biography contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists, many of whom went to jail, including Vida Goldstein's compatriots Adela Pankhurst and Jennie Baines. Baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at Yarra Bank in 1918. She is reputedly the first Australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike. Other protesters were deported. As historian Janet Butler reminds us: \"It does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide.\" The enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of Gallipoli, manifested not only in the \"shattered Anzacs\" whose families bore the burden of care, but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped Australia's social and political relations in the 20th century. Lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech \u2014 were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much, but are still accorded little recognition. Perhaps, by the 125th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives, we will come to associate riverbanks, as well as beaches, with the potent ebb and flow of freedom.

        "text": "In an unprecedented move, Russia has cancelled the release of a Hollywood thriller set in the Stalin era - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.",

The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just \u00a365 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just \u00a33,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant\u2019s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing \u2018management consultancy activities\u2019. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of \u00a33,378, down from \u00a318,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a \u00a345million house in west London - married the heiress in a \u00a37million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia\u2019s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated \u00a370,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone\u2019s family is worth an estimated \u00a33billion - and the couple are said to own a \u00a3300,000 Ferrari, \u00a3123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a \u00a3100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London .

A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: \u2018Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.\u2019 Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a \u00a350,000 Rolex and a \u00a320,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence.

Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker\u00a0Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday . Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland . REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box . WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud \u2013 proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS .

        "text": "A mother-of-two lost more than ten stone after she became concerned that her size was causing her to look like a man. Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread . Dinner: Chicken Kiev with potato croquettes and chips . Snacks: Crisps . Breakfast: Porridge with berries . Lunch: Scrambled eggs with ham and mushrooms . Dinner: Chicken stir-fry . Snacks: Throughout the day she snacks on yoghurt and fresh fruit .",

        "text": "Thousands of holidaymakers face up to three days of chaos and cancelled flights because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers. 'Ryanair said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options - full refund, free transfer onto next available flight or free transfer onto an alternative flight routing.'",

        "text": "The records just keep tumbling for Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. After his strike against Rayo Vallecano, the Portuguese forward now has 300 goals for Los Blancos, despite having played in Madrid for only six seasons, amassing 288 appearances. He has well and truly made his name as a legend at the Santiago Bernabeu, only trailing Raul and Alfredo di Stefano in the club standings. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 300 goals for Real Madrid in just six years with the La Liga giants . The Portuguese forward is catching Raul's (l) club record and is just seven goals shy of Alfredo di Stefano (r) Ronaldo heads home his 300th goal for the club - against Rayo Vallecano at the Vallecas Stadium in Madrid . 323 - Raul . 308 - Alfredo di Stefano . 300 - Cristiano Ronaldo . 289 - Carlos Santillana . 242 - Ferenc Puskas . Ronaldo has scored 206 with his right foot, 52 with his left, even managing 41 with his head. 46 of his goals at Real have been outside the box, many of them screamers. After claiming two FIFA Ballon d'Or awards during his time in Spain, as well as glory in La Liga and the Champions League, many would be running out of motivation, scratching around for more records to break. But Ronaldo, 30, doesn't only have the status of Raul or Di Stefano to look up to, but also Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, who is younger, and seemingly still improving. But there are other poachers that have formed their goalscoring reputation at one club, including a Portugal legend and an Everton hero who the former Manchester United man could draw inspiration from. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his first goal (vs Deportivo in 2009, above), and his most recent (below) THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME . 10)\u00a0Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 383 . Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60\u00a0goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident. Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside . 9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81) 394 . When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side. Willy van der Kuijlen of PSV runs with the ball in the UEFA Cup match against Bastia in 1978 . 8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 398* . Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years. Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer . CHELSEA . 211 - Frank Lampard (2001-14) 202 - Bobby Tambling (1959-70) 193 - Kerry Dixon (1983-92) EVERTON . 383 - Dixie Dean (1925-37) 159 - Graeme Sharp (1980-91) 138 - Bob Latchford (1974-81) LIVERPOOL . 346 - Ian Rush (1980-87 and 1988-96) 286 - Roger Hunt (1958-69) 241 - Gordon Hodgson (1925-36) Ian Rush netted 346 times over two spells with Liverpool and is streaks ahead of anyone else in the charts . MANCHESTER CITY . 178 - Eric Brook (1928-39) 166 - Tommy Johnson (1920-30) 153 - Colin Bell (1966-1979) MANCHESTER UNITED . 249 - Sir Bobby Charlton (1956-73) 237 - Denis Law (1962-73) 230* Wayne Rooney (2004-present) Wayne Rooney is just 19 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton at Manchester United after his recent strike . NEWCASTLE . 206 - Alan Shearer (1996-2006) 200 - Jackie Milburn (1946-57) 153 - Len White (1953-62) Alan Shearer scored 206 goals for Newcastle, while Vic Watson managed 326 for West Ham United . TOTTENHAM . 266 - Jimmy Greaves (1961-70) 208 - Bobby Smith (1955-64) 174 - Martin Chivers (1968-76) WEST HAM . 326 -  Vic Watson (1920-35) 252 - Geoff Hurst (1959-72) 166 - John Dick (1953\u201363) 166 - Jimmy Ruffell (1921-37)",

        "text": "The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England\u2019s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell\u2019s century. But \u2018the Burnley Lara\u2019, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England\u2019s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith\u2019s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four. Jos Buttler fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . West Indies fast bowler celebrates after dismissing Buttler for a duck on day two of the first Test . Stuart Broad was England's ninth wicket to fall before Anderson fell for 20 with the score on 399 . Anderson celebrates after seeing Devon Smith edge behind to Buttler to take England's first wicket . Buttler makes the catch from Anderson's bowling to dismiss Smith for 11 and leave West Indies 19 for one . Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord\u2019s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India\u2019s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England\u2019s noses in front until the wait for Anderson\u2019s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test.",
        "generated": "The first Test between England and West Indies began on Tuesday in Antigua. On the second day, England was struggling to keep up with West Indies, with Anderson's four wickets bringing him to a total of 380 and within three of Sir Ian Botham's England Test record. Jordan was also instrumental in putting the brakes on West Indies' innings, taking the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite. West Indies ended the day on 155 for four, with England still needing to make up ground to win the Test.",

        "text": "Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007\u00a0I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in\u00a0the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn\u2019t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn\u2019t that much more, but when you\u2019re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely\u00a0unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named\u00a0Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the\u00a0Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from\u00a02011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012,\u00a0858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children \u2014\u00a0she has an 8-year-old step-daughter\u00a0and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer\u00a0Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'",
        "generated": "Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed her experience with abortion, detailing the challenges and stigma she faced in obtaining a legal procedure.

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members \u2013 something that anyone can become by joining free \u2013 while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury.

Just hours after he had played the full 120 minutes it took for the Gunners to grind out a 2-1 win in extra-time over Reading in a tense FA Cup semi-final, Szczesny was treated to a lovely birthday surprise courtesy of his singer-songwriter girlfriend Mariana Luczenko. The Poland international, now 25, was joined at his home by family and friends as well as one of his favourite rock bands, 'Lemon', who delivered a private performance.

There are also pictures from Szczesny's childhood and family holidays as the goalkeeper turns 25 . Szczesny was clearly touched by the efforts of his girlfriend and took to Instagram on Monday to thank her. 'Best birthday ever!' he wrote. Arsenal's triumph over Reading sees them reach the FA Cup final for the second consecutive season, having also won the competition last year against Hull City. This year, it will be Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa who stand between the Gunners and more glory, after they defeated Liverpool in the other semi-final on Sunday. Szczesny joined Arsenal's academy in 2006 from hometown club Legia Warsaw and graduated to the first-team in three years later. Although he has racked up nearly 200 appearances for the north London outfit since then, this season has raised question marks over Szczesny's long-term future. He was caught smoking in the wake of Arsenal's 2-0 Premier League loss at Southampton on New Year's Day and has only made Cup appearances since then. Factor in the form of fellow goalkeeper David Ospina, who inherited\u00a0Szczesny's role in the league and there is a cloud of uncertainty around the Polish stopper.

        "text": "Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that\u2019s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.",

Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday:\u00a0Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, \"I'd love to take this girl to dinner.\" David Beckham embarrassed his son Brooklyn on James Corden's Late Late Show in America last month . Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . 'I said, \"Okay, great.\" I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, \"Really?\", so I said, \"Yeah, he's going to do it.\" 'She said, \"Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant.\" So I was like, \"Really, you're going to make me do that?\" and she said \"Yeah, that's the only way I'm going to let him go.\"' 'So we took him to a small sushi restaurant and he sat at the sushi bar and I sat about five tables back. By the way, my daughter is four years old. When she gets to that age, I will be closer than that!' Beckham's son Brooklyn, who was sat in the audience as his dad retold the embarrassing story, is aiming to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer. This season, he has been playing for Arsenal's Under 16s but was recently dealt a blow with the news that the Gunners will not hand him a new deal at the end of the season.

Dybala is wanted by Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Inter Milan, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain . Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini watched the Serie A match between Parma and  Palermo on Sunday . Yet the former Manchester City manager's fiercest competition would be Ligue 1 champions PSG, with Palermo determined to cash in. 'I'm in contact with the player's agent and with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi,' Zamparini told Telefoot. 'For PSG, he would be a good investment for the future. 'For me, he is the new Messi. Today, how much would you pay for Barcelona's Argentine? \u20ac200m (\u00a3143m)? \u20ac300m (\u00a3215m)? And even at that price, would he be sold? 'Messi is worth an entire team and Dybala is this kind of player. I want \u20ac40m (\u00a329m) for him but I asked Nasser for \u20ac50m (\u00a336m). 'The boy's agents have already travelled to Paris to talk to the club but Dybala has some doubts because there are already great players there.' Dybala would more likely be guaranteed a first-team place in Italy rather than France, but could be sold to the Paris club if they are prepared to meet\u00a0Zamparini's demands. Palermo are determined to cash in on Dybala as he is wanted by some of Europe's biggest clubs .

        "text": "London commuters faced traffic chaos this morning while thousands are still without power as firefighters battle to extinguish an underground blaze that has been raging for more than 24 hours. More than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in Holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables, causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke. Although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely, and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze: The scene in Holborn today, where a fire has been raging for more than 24 hours . Emergency: Firefighters and gas workers were still battling to put out the fire a day later . Plume: Flames rose up from the street in the deserted part of central London today . Continuing: Firefighters spraying water into a manhole in a bid to put out a fire in Holborn . Much of the area is cordoned off as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire, while there were reports of major delays in central London. Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible, and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway, where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed, as is the Strand underpass, while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted, and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn, but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1,000 buildings remain without power today, with businesses, government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage: Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matin\u00e9e performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including\u00a0The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.",

Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson\u2019s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club\u2019s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson\u2019s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese\u2019s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from\u00a0Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini\u2019s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City\u2019s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford\u2019s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.",

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85), \u00a0Bamford, Garcia Martinez.

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .",

James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare \u00a0\u00a3200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a \u00a3200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for \u2013 let's not be shy \u2013 a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at \u00a3208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green\u00a0Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.' James May (right) was vague on the future for the trio, hinting that they may be reunited on screen .",

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.",

        "text": "For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no\u00a0evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that\u00a0reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.",

'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after.

        "text": "Labour peer John Prescott has defended Prince Charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers - insisting he should 'right to 'write as many damn letters as he likes'. The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had 'a lot to offer this country'. Lord Prescott's intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles's so-called 'black spider' memos. Lord Prescott, left, said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott, whose letters are separate to those due to be released, said that while he is 'not a raving loyalist', he has 'a lot of time for Charles' who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters, he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said: ' Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. 'And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work, combating climate change and building sustainable communities, he can write as many damn letters as he likes.' Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince - including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician's mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved 'the measure of the man'. He said: 'They show he has nothing to hide and he shouldn't be worried about publication.' The first letter is a typed \u00adinvitation to a meeting of Regional\u00ad \u00adDevelopment Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be 'splendid' to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince's \u00addistinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott's mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has 'been overdoing the quota' of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles - with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week - does a lot of good for the country, according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this \u2013 and the 'trouble' the press would give him \u2013 he goes on to express his sadness and says his 'heart goes out' to the politician. He added: 'I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he shouldn't be writing to ministers but he's quite entitled to express his opinion. 'Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter \u2013 even from Prince Charles \u2013 to unduly \u00adinfluence them.' Prince Charles has long been accused of 'bombarding' ministers with 'black spider' memos attacking government policy. His letters are so-named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both  Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect,  according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve, the prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'.",

The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there\u2019s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won\u2019t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out \u2018Tinder Plus\u2019, a premium service allowing people to \u2018undo\u2019 a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of \u2018likes\u2019 a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them \u2018You\u2019re Out of Likes\u2019, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says \u2018Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus\u2019. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around \u00a31.49 a month to as high as \u00a314.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay \u00a317.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping \u00a3179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying \u00a3162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.'

Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour.\u00a0At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a \u00a37,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'I\u2019m so happy for Mike that he\u2019s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I can\u2019t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour.

A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker \u2013 who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche \u2013 described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise \u00a345,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London, \u00a0escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge . Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers \u2013 from South Africa \u2013 managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London \u2013 Chloe Pincho and Brennan White \u2013 were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover. Amanda Holden said her sister Debbie was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness .",

        "text": "A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times in four months while working as a services technician is hoping to use an insanity defense, claiming she was 'vulnerable, passive and gullible' and suffers from mental illness. Brett Robinson is facing 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts  between March and July last year. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named - \u00a0in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. 'Gullible':\u00a0Brett Robinson, 32, is facing 12 charges after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell at Washington County Jail and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . According to a psychologist's report obtained by Oregon Live, Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year. Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby \u2013 I could not envision my life without you in it.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25, \u00a0who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.",

        "text": "Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace\u2019s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort .

CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . \u2018You never know what to expect,\u2019 Pulis said in regard to returning to a former club. \u2018They did well for me last year and I hope I repaid them a little bit in respect to what we did in the dressing room and on the pitch. \u2018It is a good club. It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on \u2013 if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.\u2019 Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis\u2019 hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon\u2019s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. \u2018That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,\u2019 Pardew admitted. \u2018It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. \u2018We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn\u2019t come off. Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.\u2019 Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis\u2019 resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three.

Barker had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows. This is the moment 102-year-old Alice Barker, who used to dance with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, got to see herself shimmy and shake on film for the first time . Barker (pictured far right in the video) snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen . But she had never gotten the chance to watch herself dance. She didn't even have any photographs or memorabilia to remember her years on stage. It was David Shuff, who met Barker years ago when he brought his therapy dog to her retirement home, that finally reunited the one-time famous dancer with her videos. After a long and unsuccessful first search, Shuff connected with Mark Cantor, a collector of short musical films called 'soundies' who runs the online archive Jazz on Film. It was then Shuff and Cantor discovered that Barker's videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before, according to\u00a0Mashable. They located three of Barker's soundies, giving her the chance to finally watch her days in the chorus line, where she was almost always in the front row. 'Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,' Barker sang along as she watched one of her routines. When Shuff asked her how many years she danced, Barker replied 'that's all I ever did, that was it!' She said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again'.

David Shuff, who met Barker years ago at her retirement home, and archivist Mark Cantor helped locate and reunite the one-time famous dancer with three of her 'soundies', known then as short musical videos . Barker found herself needing to dance and move to  music at a young age. She told Shuff a story about when she was a child and her mother was preparing her for a bath. Her mother had gone to the house to retrieve something when a young Barker heard a band play nearby. 'When she came back I was gone,' said Barker. 'I was down there naked just going, dancing.' 'And then, if the band would stop playing, I'd look at them and \"come on, let's get it going, let's get it going here.\"' Barker said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again' But the most special part for Barker was getting to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said . Shuff shared Barker's story on\u00a0Reddit, where he wrote that the videos were now in her possession and that they are often played in her retirement center's communal room, noting that she's a 'rock star these days'. He added that Barker knows her videos are online now and that it made her happy because she 'feels connected to the world again'.

The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family's lawsuit trying to block the Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes. The lawsuit brought by Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their two children claimed the school district's yoga classes promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Scroll down for video . Students hold their positions during a yoga class at Capri Elementary School in Encinitas, California, in 2012 . A California appeals court ruled yoga classes taught at Capri do not violate students' right to religious freedom . The court upheld the previous ruling in a 3-0 opinion. The district court wrote: 'While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are, as the trial court determined, \"devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings.\" 'We conclude that the program is secular in purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and does not excessively entangle the school district in religion. 'The district's yoga program does not violate our state constitution.' The First Amendment bans school-sponsored religious promotion and prayer. Yoga instructor Kristen McCloskey (right) leads third graders at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in 2012 . The Sedlocks were disappointed with the ruling and are considering their options. Attorney Dean Broyles said: 'No other court in the past 50 years has allowed public school officials to lead children in formal religious rituals like the Hindu liturgy of praying to, bowing to, and worshipping the sun god.' A school distort lawyer said there were no rituals occurring in the classroom and no one was worshipping the sun or leading Hindu rites. The district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength, flexibility and balance. Yoga is now taught at schools across the country, but the district is believed to be the first with full-time yoga teachers at all schools. A three-year grant from the K.P. Jois Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes Ashtanga yoga, provides twice-weekly, 30-minute classes to the district's 5,600 students. About 30 families have opted out of the classes since they began in 2011.",

Dave Doggett, the chairman of Cambridge United, has warned of a new breed of hooliganism and believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals . Mr Doggett\u00a0said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our \"risk\" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their \"gangs\". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this. It's very sad.' Cambridge supporter Simon Dobbin, 42 (pictured with wife Nicole), remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after an away game to Southend on March 21. Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' Mr Doggett said older men were those causing violence. Pictured: Police with fans following reports of disorder outside Southend's Spread Eagle pub prior to the recent match between the Essex side and Cambridge . One Cambridge season ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said a group of about 30 fans regularly turn up to games looking for trouble afterwards. He said: 'They arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight.' Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after their game away to Southend on March 21. Essex Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting Cambridge fans. Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year. Pictured:\u00a0Southend United's Barry Corr beats Richard Tait to the ball in last month's match . 'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.' He said police are using football banning orders, which impose 'stringent court-backed' restrictions on individuals. He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.' The warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the Kick It Out Season of Action campaign to promote respect within football.",

An experienced climber, Dr Gallant (left) had been training for 10 years to climb Everest. She helped tend to survivors and those gravely injured before rescue helicopters arrived to get people off the mountainside . Survivor Dr Gallant said she and an Indian doctor rushed to help the injured in difficult conditions following the avalanche, including the gravely-ill Sherpa, but said there was nothing they could do to save his life. 'I was outside, saw this huge blast coming down', she told ABC News. 'I ran into the tent, threw myself on the floor. When the vibration stopped, I went out and radioed over to the medical tent. 'They asked me and an Indian climber (a doctor in the Indian army) to take care of head injuries. 'We worked through the night, doing rounds, handing out medication, putting in IVs. 'Of the nine patients, one of them died last night \u2014 a 25-year-old Sherpa. His blood pressure had fallen. There was nothing we could do.'

A blatant Josh Meekings handball in the box was missed by referee Steven McLean and his team, particularly assistant Alan Muir, at the end of the first half with the Parkhead club left to rue the decision not to award a penalty and dispense a red card. A goal down at the time, Inverness fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the Celtic players could do little to hide their fury after the match. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . Despite numerous appeals, no penalty or red card was given for Meekings' handball and Inverness won . 'We have a lot of disappointed lads inside that dressing room \u2014 we've been robbed,' said Griffiths who, more than an hour after the final whistle, was still struggling to contain his own disbelief and anger. 'It was very disappointing. We had a chance to go and make history. We didn't get the result in the end.' Celtic were a Virgil van Dijk goal to the good at the time of the Meekings incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon was sent off for a foul on Marley Watkins. Greg Tansey equalised with the resultant spot-kick and suddenly John Hughes' men were in ascendancy. With the teams level at full-time, Edward Ofere and John Guidetti swapped goals in extra-time before David Raven grabbed a 117th-minute winner \u2014 leaving the Highlanders jubilant and their opponents distraught. Parkhead manager Ronny Deila had insisted he need not say anything about the penalty incident. Scott Brown, meanwhile, stalked past with a face like thunder, lightning and Force 10 hurricane all rolled into one angry swirling mass, damned near taking the door off its hinges as he made a dramatic exit from the depths of the national stadium. 'I have asked the centre-half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent, so in my book that's a penalty and a red card,' continued Griffiths. 'We have probably the best penalty taker in the league in Kris Commons, who I am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2-0 up. They'd have been down to 10 men and it would have been a mountain for them to come back. Celtic's Aleksandar Tonev (centre) is challenged by Marley Watkins (left) and Edward Ofere (right) on Sunday . Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'I knew it was a penalty. I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. The second half has been very lucky. 'He is the one who said it hit him in the face (the additional assistant ref). I asked the ref why he didn't give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him in the face. I don't know what angle he is looking from because everyone else could see it was a penalty. 'He said the referee behind the goal said it hit him in the face and there is nothing I can do about that now. It is a game-changing decision. 'When you have officials behind the goals, they need to be doing their job. If he thinks that's him in on the face ...? 'I don't really want to say too much about the officials because I'll end up in trouble. But it's a massive, massive decision and it's cost us the game. 'Everybody was so content that we were going to win the league, we already have a trophy (the League Cup) in the bag. Everyone was saying the Scottish Cup was practically a given. But we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done.' Griffiths attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday against Inverness . As much as Griffiths was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another Hampden semi-final goal, the former Hibs star felt for manager Deila, a man who has been so open about his desire to win a Treble \u2013 and his belief in this team's ability to do so. Celtic had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed, backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done, whatever obstacles they might have to overcome. 'I think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone,' said the Griffiths. 'He'd only have been the third Celtic manager to have won a Treble. 'He would have made history and as players we would have become legends. But it' s difficult to do that. I said it during the week that when you are that close to winning a Treble, the games get harder. Inverness stood in our way and did a job. 'Now we have to go again and pick ourselves up for the rest of the season. We have a massive game at Dens Park on Wednesday. Dundee will be up for it, we've just played 120 minutes in a semi-final. We have three days and then we have to play Dundee at a difficult venue. But we need three points. 'This will fire us up. We aren't far away from clinching the league now. We have two hard games in the next week at Dens and Tannadice. If we go there and pick up three points from each, we will be in a real good position.' From Treble to Double, just like that. Celtic will be weary on Wednesday, certainly. But Dundee should certainly beware some kind of angry backlash. And the Dens Park ground staff may want to reinforce some of the doors. Just in case Brown takes the storm with him. Celtic pair Tonev (left) and John Guidetti look dejected after their side drops out of the Cup on Sunday .",

The charity event provides vacations for maimed soldiers, their carers and families - but ran afoul of braying frat boys holding an event of their own earlier this month. One veteran, wounded Nicholas Connole, said frat members spat on him and his service dog from their balconies. He told local TV station WJHG: 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts.' Haley Riley, whose husband is another injured veteran, said students hurled beer bottles at attendees. Linda Cope, who founded the retreat after her son lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said that rowdy students even went so far as to urinated on the American flag. Suspension: The Zeta Beta Tau chapter at the University of FLorida has been suspended, and three of its members expelled. There is nothing to suggest anybody in the photograph above was involved . Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was suspended in the wake of the allegations, which university authorities are investigating. They have charged the organization with 'causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and property damage'. The fraternity has expelled three members and is also holding its own investigation. The expelled frat members have not been named. It has yet to determine what exactly took place, but said in a statement that 'there is no doubt that some our members engaged in unacceptable behavior.' While Panama City Beach police were called to deal with the frat members, they ultimately let the resort management handle them, and did not file any charges or write a police report. Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was already on probation after being found guilty of holding hazing rituals at the start of this academic year. It was already restricted to a limited events program - and will face even tougher penalties than usual if the university decides to take action.

        "text": "A 78-year-old Connecticut man with a long criminal history was arrested on Friday, but the man's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in U.S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most . recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of . illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms .

        "text": "(CNN)It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. \"That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,\" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. \"I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,\" attorney Mary Koch said this week, \"I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents \"an inflection point,\" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a \"continuation in a process toward justice.\" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a \"duty to protect the justice process.\" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to \"seek justice for optics\" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: \"Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end.\" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. \"We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,\" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI \"will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks.\" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess \"policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens.\" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. \"Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,\" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. \"We welcome outside review,\" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. \"We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened.\" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he \"fled unprovoked.\" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. \"We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,\" he said. \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a \"rough ride\" or \"nickel ride,\" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is \"potential\" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. \"That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,\" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again \"to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. \"It's complex,\" Davis said of the probe. \"It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.",

But while the story is in itself tragic, it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling. I encountered two such individuals on my mission to Damascus -- Jihad and Mohammad -- tiny, vulnerable infants who were taken from Yarmouk in recent days, a place that was described last week by the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as \"the deepest circle of hell.\" The fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children. Looking into those bright young faces, touching their pristine hands, the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me. Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. I want to introduce you to them in the hope that you, too, will understand why I am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in Syria. Jihad Ya'qoub, the youngest Palestinian refugee to flee Yarmouk, was born on March 30. His mother, Said Fatima, never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough. \"I was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy, but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items,\" she said. Said Fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day. Mohammad was born in Yarmouk on January 25 of this year. When ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened, his mother, Nadia, fled in search of safety. Her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son. Yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future. She hopes that if and when life returns to normal, she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in Yarmouk. These tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all. When I next brief the Security Council, as I did a few days ago, I will tell them about Jihad and Mohammad.  I will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside Yarmouk, other civilians who need help where they are. To do this, hostilities will have to subside. Pressure must be exerted on armed actors in Yarmouk to this end. Beyond that, those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely. These things are all possible. But it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more, nothing less. Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold. I believe they can. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them. And that is simply not an option.",

        "text": "(CNN)Geography is, in part, destiny for Italy: The country will always be a bridge between Africa and Europe, as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean so starkly shows. A surge of refugees this year, usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels, has sought to reach Europe via the Libyan coast.  A boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from Libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking. Over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of Italy in the last week alone. European leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency. There is a backstory here worthy of our attention, and it has to do with Italy's colonial past. Many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of Italy's former colonies in North and East Africa, namely Eritrea (occupied from 1890-1941) and Somalia (1908-1941). As migrants, Libyans are fewer in number, but Libya (1912-1941) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for Italy. Italy's empire never rivaled that of the British and the French in scope and longevity, but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected. Indeed, the migrants traversing the Mediterranean today form part of a century-long chain of migrations, expulsions, and exiles sparked by Italy's imperial ambition and commercial interests, the post-colonial anger of African leaders, and now mass economic desperation and political strife. Long after the formal end of Italian colonialism, these Eritreans, Somalis, and Libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries. It also affects the treatment of Africans who settle in Italy. Libya is an example of the long reach of Italian imperialism. Libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of Italy, on the model of French Algeria, and Libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship's persecution of those who resisted Italian occupation. Over 100,000 Libyan men, women, and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed. Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who ruled from 1969 to 2011, was born during the Italian occupation of his country, and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as Omar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931. In 1970, soon after he took power, Gadhafi struck back, expelling the remaining Italian community in Libya. Some of those people had grown up entirely in Libya. They arrived in Italy for the first time, at some of the same ports receiving migrants today. This political intervention did not spell the end of Italian-Libyan commercial dealings, which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made Libya Italy's biggest oil supplier. Since 2004, Italy and Libya have been directly connected by the Greenstream natural gas pipeline, which runs below the Mediterranean, on the same axis as many migrant boats. Commercial concerns, and the cozy relationship of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi, also lay behind a historic 2008 Friendship Treaty between Italy and Libya, which promised infrastructure and other aid to Libya worth the equivalent of $5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by Italy during the decades of colonial rule. Until his death in 2011, despite deals with Italy and the European Union to control departures from his borders, Gadhafi intermittently used European fears of mass arrivals of migrants from Libya as a political weapon. Given Europe's geography, this weapon was pointed particularly at Italy, Libya's former master, and the principal target of Gadhafi's post-colonial revenge politics. Few Italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies, even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former Italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise. Upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration, C\u00e9cile Kyenge, an Italian of Congolese origin, faced ugly racist attacks from fellow Italian politicians, including a comment that she looked like an orangutan. This climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the \"heroes\" of fascist imperialism. In 2012, the town of Affile built a publicly-funded memorial to General Rodolfo Graziani, known as \"the butcher of Fezzan\" for his brutal repression of Libyan resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of Ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life. This colonial history and its long-term consequences can help us understand Italians' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores. Italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly, and yet migrants who remain in Italy are often subject to racist attacks. It is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the Italian Navy in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist's dictatorship's bid to control the Mediterranean: Mare Nostrum. The program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to European Union budget restrictions. It seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the Italian government to its past aggressions: an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner. The Italian government deserves the full support of the European Union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis. But it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past. At 40 years old, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the Mediterranean.

        "text": "Yaya Toure's attacking gifts aren't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore, said Gary Neville in a scathing attack on the Ivorian following Manchester City's 4-2 derby loss to United. Manuel Pellegrini's City were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against Louis van Gaal's side at Old Trafford and Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, is certain big changes are afoot for the club. 'It's a crossroads for them now,' Neville said as City drifted four points behind their third-placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off Arsenal in second. Yaya Toure's defensive lapses are costing Manchester City, claims Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Niall Quinn and\u00a0Graeme Souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under-fire Ivorian . 'There is definitely going to be change at Manchester City, whether it's players, the manager, people above. Certainly some players. 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick. You cannot carry passengers.' Neville singled out Toure as an example of the 'weeds' at the Etihad in a scathing attack. 'He does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively,' he said. 'But when the balance tips to a point when going forward isn't quite as effective as it once was, you've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor. Neville predicts changes at Manchester City and says the club need to get rid of 'weeds in the garden' 'If I was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you're not chasing back, you're not running around, you're not sprinting for the ball. There might be a physical problem that he cannot do it, let alone if he doesn't want to do it. I think there's definitely going to be some changes.' Graeme Souness, also on Sky Sports, even suggested the 31-year-old's work when his side doesn't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing Champions League results in recent years. Neville accused Toure of a 'complete dereliction of (his) duty' when marking Marouane Fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for United's third goal from Juan Mata. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday their their cross-city rivals . 'He cannot play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality,' said Neville on Sky Sports. 'Against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top, but against any team of quality you've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield. 'There are too many examples, too much evidence when watching him where he cannot do his job, simple as that. As a central midfield player in the big matches he just cannot do it.' Souness said Toure's become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate after the winger's cross found the tall Belgian for 2-1 . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why they've not done as well as they should have done in Europe.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pointed the finger at the City chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are 'gone'. The former Liverpool defender told talkSPORT:\u00a0'They\u2019ve been a great team, but that team needs breaking up and changing. The criticism I have is for the people at the top, to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team. 'You look at the age of the team and it\u2019s too old, so you need a lot of new blood. It\u2019s going to take a lot of money. 'It\u2019s gone for them now, physically, mentally, every part of the game. They\u2019ve been a great team and we should applaud what they\u2019ve achieved over the past three or four years, but it\u2019s the end for this team now. It\u2019s got to be broken up.' Niall Quinn, also on Sky Sports, said bluntly: 'Manchester City lost out today because he was all at sea and didn't do his defensive duties.' Toure also came in for criticism on Match of the Day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain's armband at half-time. Trevor Sinclair said: 'He keeps on getting caught in no-mans land, he's not really at it, clipping the heels, and he's literally going through the motions. Trevor Sinclair and Phil Neville were both critical of City and Toure on Match of the Day 2 . 'Fellaini has completely outshone him today. He is outnumbered and I'm sure he's frustrated but again he's just going through the motions.' Picking out on particular aerial duel, which Toure lost, Sinclair said: 'This is nothing to do with ability, that's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team.' Sinclair also felt Toure was at fault for Chris Smalling's goal, United's fourth. 'He's got to organise this better,' he said. 'If you're captain of the team you've got to keep that high line, dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball. They were queuing up on the far stick.' Phil Neville said: 'The minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall, they crumble. They lost their shape, they lost their discipline, they were all over the place. 'There was nobody in there today that said \"right, we're going to get two banks of four, hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result\".'",

The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it\u2019s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area with small populations remaining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Kevin Bradley, CEO of Save the Bilby Fund told Daily Mail Australia that it\u2019s very difficult to pin point the exact number of bilbies left in Australia because of their \u2018cryptic\u2019 nocturnal habits. Scroll down for video . The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it\u2019s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area . \u2018We know they are extinct in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with very few bilbies left in Queensland and scattered populations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia\u2019 'Things aren\u2019t looking great and their future in the wild is very tenuous.\u2019 In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Mr Bradley said the critters were of 'high significance to traditional land owners' with record of bilby populations dating back '15 million years'. Until recently, Australia had two species of Bilbies- the Greater Bilby and the Lesser Bilby. The Lesser Bilby is already believed to be extinct while the Greater Bilby is classed as \u2018endangered\u2019 in Queensland and \u2018vulnerable\u2019 nationally. In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Predators like feral cats and foxes are the biggest threat to the bilby populations while other contributing factors include farm animals destroying bilby habitat and introduced species like rabbits competing with them for food and burrows. Mr Bradley said foxes and feral cats are \u2018desimating the population.\u2019 The Australian Wildlife Conservancy said feral cats are the driving force behind the dramatic decline of wildlife across the country with the feral felines killing an estimated 75 million native animals every night. 'I think people are starting to recognise that these animals are having such a devastating effect on many native animal populations.' Mr Bradley said the Federal Government has committed to a National Feral Animal Summit this year that will  focus on creating a plan to address the feral cat issue. In the mean time, the Save the Bilby Fund have developed a captive breeding program and believe that continuing breeding efforts in controlled environments could be they key to saving the endangered marsupial. The Greater Bilby is a nocturnal marsupial with a silky grey and white coat and a long black and white tail. Bilbies have large ears, a long snouts and a great sense of smell that helps them locate food. The bilby is omnivorous and eats bulbs, fruit, seeds, fungi, insects, worms, termintes and even small lizards or spiders. They don\u2019t need regular water because, like koalas, they get most of their water from their food. The Royal Visit: Even the Royal family, pictured, wanted to drop by to get some face time with the native marsupial .",

Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu\u2019s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of \u2018beef masala\u2019 were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors \u2013 drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) \u2014 are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. \u201cWhen we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of \u2018beef masala\u2019.

Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. \u201cWe did not touch the Pakistani aid,\u201d Dr Singh said. \u201cMost of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,\u201d said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: \u201cPakistan has hurt Nepal\u2019s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.\u201d Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the \u2018beef masala\u2019 packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today.

These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks\u2026.\u201d Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted.

The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods.

The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the \u2018apron area\u2019 of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu.

Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. \u201cDGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It\u2019s scary,\u201d a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. \u201cThe team didn\u2019t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,\u201d a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. \u201cEven then, the rescue team members didn\u2019t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,\u201d a senior immigration official said. \u201cThey had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn\u2019t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,\u201d a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: \u201cNo one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.\u201d The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.",

        "text": "When journalist Gianna Toboni\u00a0traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get. For nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. 'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online. Baby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni\u00a0(pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry . Shady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months . But the heartbreak did not end there. As Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the \u2018embryo outsourcing\u2019 agencies featured in the Vice documentary. During her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies. And if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. For the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact \u2018extra\u2019 babies being sold on the black market. The agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant. Shocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them . No morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner . Gianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner. 'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. Gianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody. 'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer. The sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team. In the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money. Commercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World. 'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element. No options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money . Dormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth . Tight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room . And while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a \u2018cheap\u2019 alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family. Women can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives. But there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised. When I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second . Surrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day. Gianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section. Dr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession. And while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options. During the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' Dishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area . No choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day . Too quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country . She continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.\u2019 Another surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'. Gianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation. 'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said. Gianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate. He made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival. 'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted. As a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority\u2019 have no idea this dark underbelly exits. Gianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.",

But, hang on a minute, it's simply giving my margarita a good shake. Pouring drinks is only one of these bartenders' tricks. In the evening, they dance to music. Scroll down for video . New attraction: The enormous Anthem Of The Seas is set to welcome more than 80,000 people on board this summer . Making waves: An instructor demonstrates the FlowRider wave machine on board Royal Caribbean's ship, Anthem Of The Seas . The Bionic Bar is among many hi-tech gimmicks on board the 4,180-passenger Anthem Of The Seas, Royal Caribbean's second Quantum-class liner, which last week set sail on its maiden voyage. Passengers have rubber wristbands fitted with electronic chips, which can be pressed against various sensors. I use mine as a room key, to make payments and to check my itinerary on handy tablets around the ship. The 375 interior staterooms also have sea views from virtual balconies \u2014 window-sized LED screens showing real-time footage shot by exterior cameras. This ship is clearly aimed at younger cruisers. The indoor SeaPlex activity area (the largest of its kind at sea) has bumper cars, a roller disco and circus school. There's also an observation capsule (another first), which swoops out over the ship, a FlowRider wave machine for surfing and body\u00ad boarding, and RipCord by iFLY - a vertical wind tunnel for skydiving at sea. I'll have a caipirinha, please: Robotic bartenders mix and serve cocktails in the decidedly futuristic Bionic Bar . Fairground thrills: Adrenaline junkies will also be able to enjoy the bumper cars as part of an amazing variety of entertainment .

At the latter, my instructor tells me to thrust out my hips to avoid spinning out of control. In my post-\u00adskydive photo, the instructor has two arms around my bottom and his face in my chest - and I look as though I've had a bad facelift. The Anthem's 18 restaurants include a hotdog-\u00adfilled food truck and a Johnny Rockets American diner.

        "text": "Letting the Scottish Nationalists dictate the direction of the UK government would be like getting King Herod to 'run a baby farm', Boris Johnson warned today in an escalation of Tory attacks on the SNP. The Tory London Mayor warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK, 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy'. He likened it to 'asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery'. Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy' Ms Sturgeon launched her SNP manifesto today, boasting that she can 'lead the UK' with polices on British foreign policy, benefits, energy bills and English university tuition fees. The SNP leader vowed to use a surge in support for her party to dictate the direction of the UK government, calling for an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Ed Miliband would have to pay for propping up a weak Labour government. Ms Sturgeon set out a 'programme for delivery on a UK-wide basis', raising the prospect of Scottish nationalist MPs calling the shots on policies which apply only in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Polls suggest up to half of Scots are planning to vote SNP, handing the party dozens of seats and leaving Labour's Ed Miliband unable to secure a majority. The SNP has claimed that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. Mr Johnson, who is expected to play a more high profile role in the Tory campaign from this week, issued a blunt warning about allowing an anti-Union party to dictate policy in Westminster. 'You wouldn't get Herod to run a baby farm, would you?,' he wrote in the\u00a0Daily Telegraph. 'It would not normally occur to you to interview a convicted jewel thief for the post of custodian of the Tower of London. 'You would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or Attila the Hun to work as a doorkeeper for the Roman senate. 'Any such course of action would be totally nuts. So can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the Scottish Nationalist Party to a position of effective dominance in the government of the United Kingdom - an entity that they are sworn to destroy?' He said the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia' but Mr Miliband has no chance of entering Number 10 without their support. Nicola Sturgeon today demanded an end to austerity as the price for propping up a Labour government in what was quickly dubbed a \u00a3140billion 'ransom note' for Britain . The SNP want higher taxes, to scrap Trident and end efforts to reform the welfare system, Mr Johnson warned. Mr Miliband will be left 'sitting in the driving seat, pretending to be steering the car - but all the time he will have clever Nicola next to him, whispering in his ear, and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the Left'. Speaking at her manifesto launch, Ms Sturgeon said she had not 'heard the comments of Boris Johnson directly'. But speaking at the SNP manifesto launch, she said: 'If he did say that, then that is an entirely offensive comment, and I think it will be treated as that not just by people in Scotland but across the UK, who, in my experience, ordinary people the length and breadth of the UK do not see Scotland that way at all and do not see the SNP in that way at all.' However, the warning was echoed by David Cameron today, in a speech setting out the risks to England, Wales and Northern Ireland if the Scottish Nationalists are calling the shots. The Prime Minister yesterday suggested key services like roads and hospitals in the rest of the UK would suffer as a price of SNP support. ''This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom \u2013 England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.'",

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. \"Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for,\" CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. \"Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC.\" The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the \"Big Bang\" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  \"But we know that this model is not complete,\" Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. \"After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape,\" said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Bordry. \"But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels.\" Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.",

In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he\u00a0was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months.

In an interview on photographic blog  Slate, he added: 'I had enough Chinese that I could get around in the big cities, but once I got into the highlands or mountains they don't speak Mandarin. 'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat. The three projects together form part of his mission to inspire people to think about food and its origins in an enlightened way.

        "text": "In 2018, Nasa will launch the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System (SLS). Tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting Orion to the top propulsion stage of the SLS -will be 11 self-contained small satellites, each about the size of a large shoebox. Now, the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space. A concept image of the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout mission, one of 11 missions that will be secondary payloads to the first test flight of Nasa's Space Launch System . 'Nasa is taking advantage of a great opportunity to conduct more science beyond our primary focus of this mission,' said Jody Singer manager of Nasa's Flight Programs and Partnerships Office. 'While this new vehicle will enable missions beyond Earth orbit, we're taking steps to increase the scientific and exploration capability of SLS by accommodating small, CubeSat-class payloads.' The first is a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit . Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. 'A solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and SLS will get us there,' said Les Johnson, principal investigator for NEA Scout at Marshall. 'It will take us out of Earth orbit and to interplanetary space - where we need to be to deploy the solar sail. It's a perfect ride to begin our mission.' Nasa's Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. Lunar Flashlight will use a large solar sail, similar to the NEA Scout sail, to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice. Meanwhile, BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. The BioSentinel mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18-month mission. The experiments will be launched by Houston-based Nasa in 2018 during a test flight of the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System . The missions are a key part of the historic test flight, dubbed Exploration Mission-1. About 10 minutes after Orion and its service module escape the pull of Earth's gravity, the two will disconnect and Orion will proceed toward the moon. Once Orion is a safe distance away, the small payloads will begin to be deployed, all at various times during the flight depending on the particular missions. These CubeSats are small nano-satellites designed to be efficient and versatile. The masses of these secondary payloads are light - no heavier than 30lb (14kg). They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space. 'We are expanding the capabilities of this particular SLS test flight,' said Joseph Pelfrey, deputy manager of the Exploration and Space Transportation Development Office at Marshall. 'The rocket will be the strongest ever built by Nasa and we want to take advantage of that design. 'Flying secondary payloads is something we plan to do for missions to come and provide the science community an opportunity they haven't had before.' They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space. Pictured is an artist's impression of the Space Launch System .",

        "text": "The belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed. David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs \u2013 which include Prozac and Seroxat \u2013 was based on the \u2018marketing of a myth\u2019. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, \u2018a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance\u2019. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: \u2018For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. \u2018For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.\u2019 However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor\u2019s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the \u2018real world\u2019. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u2018That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established.\u00a0How they do this is not. \u2018Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. \u2018Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. \u2018People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.\u2019 NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: \u2018It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.\u2019 Professor Healy\u2019s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: \u2018In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year\u2019s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday\u2019s models. \u2018The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin\u2019, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King\u2019s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u2018Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn\u2019t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs \u2018correct\u2019 an \u2018imbalance\u2019 of serotonin in the brain. \u2018Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the \u2018real world\u2019 \u2018Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin\u2019s involvement in depression.\u2019 Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: \u2018In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. \u2018David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. \u2018In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. \u2018The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.\u2019",

Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than \u00a350,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from \u00a310,000 to \u00a312,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least \u00a350,000 was also a\u00a0priority, he said. At present anyone earning between \u00a331,866 to \u00a3150,000 is taxed at the higher rate.\u00a0Those earning above \u00a3150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to \u00a312,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to \u00a350,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum, is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP, who want to break up the country, is deeply disturbing.' He added the Scottish nationalist leaders were 'much stronger' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together. 'That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the Union but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.' He also accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' by not agreeing to a debate with him and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

The 36-year-old is gearing up for his $300million welterweight showdown with Floyd Mayweather on May 2 - in what is set to become the richest bout in boxing history. But the Philipine star took time out of his preparation to thank American film director Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for their support so far. Manny Pacquiao took to Instagram to thank Spike Lee and Tito Mikey ahead of his bout vs Floyd Mayweather . The 36-year-old also posted a photo thanking NBA legend Karl Malone (centre left) for visiting him at the gym . 'Hello to all my fans in New York and thank you to Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for supporting Team Pacquiao,' Pacquaio said via Instagram on Thursday. 'I hope to see you soon. God bless.' The duo are just the latest to show their support for the 'Pac-man' ahead of his fight against Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas next month. Former two-time NBA MVP and 14-time All-Star Karl Malone is another who appears to be behind the camp of the southpaw boxer. Later on Thursday, Pacquaio took to Instagram again to post a picture with the 51-year-old at his Wild Card gym base in Los Angeles. Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Accompanied with the caption: 'Thank you Karl Malone for visiting me today. God Bless you and your family,' the pair are all smiles alongside trainer Freddie Roach. And speaking earlier in the week, Roach believes that his fighter has a better chance of beating Mayweather now than he did in 2010. Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com : 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.' The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 .",

But while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared, they are still far from knowing how it appeared. Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared. \u00a0Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid, is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides. It is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life, along with DNA and proteins. The main job of RNA is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome. This prevents the DNA from having to leave the nucleus, and protects it from damage. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study, by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder, is based on a discovery in the 1980s that RNA can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is similar to DNA, and carries out a number of jobs in our cells, including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes. Scientists believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA played a leading role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process. The image shows a droplet of condensed nano-DNA and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left. The liquid crystal droplets act as 'micro-reactors' where short DNA can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . 'Our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early Earth when the first DNA-like molecular fragments appeared,' said CU-Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark, a study co-author. The study suggests that the way in which DNA emerged in the early Earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise. In the pre-RNA world, the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids \u2013 the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly. 'The new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions, the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers, thereby providing a pre-RNA route to the RNA world,' added Professor Clark.",
        "generated": "Scientists have been able to determine that life on Earth began evolving approximately 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still uncertain about the exact mechanism of its appearance. Researchers have discovered evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with \"instructions\" that led to the growth of complex life forms 4 billion years ago. The study by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder suggests that these fragments used their natural self-evolving abilities to assemble into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study is based on a discovery from the 1980s that RNA, which plays a leading role in creating complex organisms, can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is a biological molecule similar to DNA, made up of one or more nucleotides. The researchers believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA may have played a key role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers argue that RNA chains are too specialized to have formed as a result of random chemical reactions. The new study claims that primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in a different way, by self-assembling into long polymer chains. The researchers found that the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favors their binding into longer polymers. Their findings suggest that the emergence of DNA in the early Earth was due to its structural properties and ability to self-organize.",
        "summary": "Scientists say early DNA-like fragments guided their own growth .\nThey claim the process can drive the formation of chemical bonds .\nThese connect short DNA chains to form long ones for life to evolve .\nThis self-assembly capability has been shown to take place in RNA ."

The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things. Zara (pictured competing in the 2012 London Games) said she is keen to win a place on Team GB in 2016 . The 33-year-old (pictured with Jessica Ennis-Hill with their medals in 2012) is yet to qualify for the forthcoming Olympics . 'In the afternoon I'll do extra exercise like swimming or cycling.' Zara helped take home team silver at the 2012 London Olympics and is keen to compete int he 2016 games. The Queen's granddaughter when she was pregnant in 2013 . 'I hope to be part of the eventing team that goes to the Olympics in Rio, but first I need to qualify.' A keen eventer, she said she is eager for daughter Mia to spend time around horses as she grows up. 'I expect Mia will grow up with horses all around her, just like her mum did,' she added. The one-year-old's father previously revealed the couple had 'three Shetland ponies waiting for her'. Speaking in an interview in January, Mr Tindall, who has recently taken part in the reality skiing show The Jump, said: 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. 'You are going to travel around a lot.' Earlier this year Zara told of how little Mia enjoyed playing with her royal relatives Prince George and her cousins, Savannah and Isla. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia at Magic Millions Race Day in January she said of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 'We've all got small ones now so it's great fun.' Prince William and his wife are expecting their second child this week, with palace sources confirming Kate's due date to be April 25.

Since the series started airing last month estate agents said they have seen a rise in enquiries about the cottage, overlooking an ancient smugglers\u2019 cove on Cornwall\u2019s north coast, and other properties where the title character, Ross Poldark, plies his trade. Scroll down for video . A beachfront property with summer and winter cottages (middle, bottom left) has gone on the market for \u00a33million in Cornwall . The property has stunning views of Smugglers Cove, and the summer and winter cottages are linked via a lift (pictured: summer cottage) Poldark actor Aidan Turner has become a heartthrob for fans after his character took off his shirt on the popular BBC One show . Ben Standen, from estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff of Truro, said Smugglers Cottage in Smugglers Cove, near Portreath, has a summer and winter cottage, cleverly linked via a lift. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the property has direct access to the beach and an amazing view of uninterrupted coast and open sea. The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, and they can be used separately to provide lots of space for a family. Mr Standen said: \u2018The fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years.\u2019 The scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline, but interest in the programme, based on Winston Graham\u2019s Poldark historical novels, set in the 18th century, is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the stunning property has direct access to the beach . One of the larger bedrooms in the summer cottage offers amazing views of Smugglers Cove on the northern coast of Cornwall .

The show\u2019s popularity is coupled with the county\u2019s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination . \u2018There are more people coming down here more regularly and expressing interest in buying a second home. \u2018Properties on the coastline with these breathtaking views have got a lot of appeal and are incredibly popular, which the series has made people more aware of.\u2019 The show\u2019s popularity is coupled with the county\u2019s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination. Estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in Cornwall since Poldark began airing last month . Smuggling was rife in the 18th century, when Poldark is set, and Cornwall's coast is full of hidden coves and tucked-away inlets. It was popular with smugglers because it had a long expanse of rocky, virtually uninhabited coast. With few revenue men to patrol it, goods like tea, brandy, rum and tobacco were smuggled in. All four of Fowey's public toilets are out of service just weeks before summer . Poldark fans and thousands of other holidaymakers who are planning to visit a popular seaside town in Cornwall may have nowhere to go when nature calls. Located in the heart of Poldark country, the town of Fowey is locked in a bizarre and long-running wrangle over public toilets. All four of the main public conveniences in Fowey \u2013 where a Poldark exhibition is being planned in May \u2013 are closed and with the summer tourist season fast approaching, there\u2019s no sign of the wee wrangle being resolved. The town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from Cornwall Council at the start of 2013. But more than two years later, the details of the transfer of ownership of three of them - Caffa Mill, the main car park and Readymoney Cove \u2013 are still being worked out by the county council while the fourth block, at the Town Quay, is shut for refurbishment. Town clerk Sally Vincent said: \u2018There is nothing more the town council can do to push it on... it is still in the legal loop. \u2018I am hopeful it will be completed soon. \u2018The town council is really pleased to be able to take on the ownership of the toilets. \u2018As a town council we feel we need to get the Town Quay toilets up and running and then go from there. It's important that Fowey has these facilities.\u2019 The Town Quay toilets were already owned by the town council but leased to Cornwall Council, which has meant the handover could be completed more quickly. Refurbishment work started last week and it is hoped they will be open within eight weeks, with the toilet for the disabled being available to use while work is done on the others. When they reopen, visitors will have to pay 20p per use to offset the cost to the town council of running them. Mrs Vincent added: \u2018The cost of running toilets is astronomical. \u2018The town council simply doesn't have the money to do it for nothing so it was felt that if we charge 20p it would be something towards it.\u2019 Cornwall Council figures suggest it will cost a minimum of \u00a326,000 a year to run the four sets of toilets, with the town having to cover insurance costs and business rates as well as cleaning, maintenance and consumables. Until the transfer of ownership on the three blocks at the main car park, Readymoney Cove and Caffa Mill, is completed, the responsibility for opening the toilets will rest with Cornwall Council.",

The cash will be put towards the Abbey's restoration fund, which is aiming to raise \u00a320million to repair the collapsing floor, fit heating powered by the Bath springs, and expand the building. A mysterious benefactor posted the plain brown envelope to officials at Bath Abbey, pledging \u00a31.5million to the church's \u00a320million restoration fund . Laura Brown, who is heading up the Footprint restoration project, said she had to read the letter twice before she could believe it was real, adding that she had to have a 'sit down' afterwards . The donation was accompanied by a note, which reads: 'Much impressed by the care and the consultation with has been put in by the Abbey, which is such a vital part of Bath\u2019s future. 'This generation has a solemn duty to ensure the Abbey is fit and able to carry out its service to the city and the community for the next hundred years.'

        "text": "Detectives probing the murders of a Playboy bunny and a 16-year-old schoolgirl 40 years ago have offered a \u00a340,000 reward in a bid to bring their killer to justice. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of 18 March 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was  attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of 18 March 1975 . Both murders were linked in July 2006 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. It appears the motive was sexual - Lynne had been raped, and it is likely Eve had also been raped although detectives haven't been able to rule out consensual sex. The reward was posted last night as detectives appealed for information, which could lead to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible, on BBC's Crimewatch show. Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, described the murder 40 years ago as a 'true life sentence' for the family. Lynne Weedon (right) was beaten over the head with a blunt object.\u00a0Detectives believes Lynda Farrow (left), who was knifed to death in 1979, was also a victim of the same killer . She said: 'We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like. 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence. 'The hurt eases but the pain still sits deep somewhere inside. There are so many questions. So many thoughts. So much heartache. 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from Scotland Yard  said he was hopeful the killer had let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend or even a cellmate or medical professional. He said it is likely the suspect for both murders is now in his 60s or 70s. The glamour model was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times . Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Mr McHugh said detectives are keeping an open mind but have previously said it is possible the killer knew his victims, particularly Eve who had a huge circle of friends and acquaintances. He added: 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. 18 March 1975: Playboy bunny Eve Stratford found  with her throat slashed at her home. 3 September 1975: Lynne Weedon, 16, was attacked and raped in an alleyway  at 11pm. 10 September 1975: Schoolgirl died in hospital from her injuries. July 2006: Murders linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims. March 2015: Police launched\u00a0fresh appeal on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. April 2015: Detectives offer \u00a340,000 reward for information about killings. 'It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Mr McHugh appealed in particular to mental health professionals and prison officers who may have received disclosures from a patient or prisoner. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her\u00a0throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. Miss Stratford (left) worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966 . This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body.

Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted: 'I dunno what the hell \u200bI am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with \u200bit' The one-time boy band star shied away from talking in detail about his daughter but instead admitted these were 'rough times.' However, in an odd moment during his 45-minute set, he took time out to promote his kine of BBQ sauces.

Unresponsive: On January 31, Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub. She's been in a coma ever since . The 46-year-old was given the biggest cheer of the night as he took to the stage to play hits like Don't Be Cruel and \u200bOn Our Own. \u200bAfter his drawn-out introduction Bobby, looking tired from performing dance moves, choked up as he said: 'I must \u200btell y'all. This feels really, \u200breally really good. 'I want to thank all of y'all for coming out tonight\u200b to support me and my family. \u200b'Rough times are rough times, hard times are hard times I dunno what the hell \u200bI am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with it.' \u200bPanting and sounding frustrated: '\u200bThere is only one thing I ask of you all tonight and that is enjoy yourselves.'

Bobby needed a towel to wipe his face and often looked out of breath as he relived dance moves from his glory days. Later he was a little less emotional as fans cheered his performances of hits like Roni and Rock Witcha. Broke his silence: The former boy bander's appearance was booked before Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. It was also Brown's first time discussing the matter in public . Had a booth: Brown told the LA crowd, 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff to my new album to my new Edition to Heads Of States and I have been working on my food line; actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth' Looking toward his stand where his Bobby Brown BBQ cooking tent was set up at the festival, he told the crowd:\u00a0'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff, to my new album, to my new Edition to Heads Of States, and I have been working on my food line.

Wiping away sweat from his face, he added: 'I ain't done with it yet. I got marinades and all kind of s*** coming out.' He then corrected himself: 'Excuse my French baby girl. I didn't mean to curse in front of you. And ladies too.' He then introduced his new \u200bR&B\u200b boy band band 'who can saanng.' 'You just listen and tell me if you like it.'

Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.",

A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, as well as honouring Diego Su\u00e1rez, who discovered the bones. The seven-year-old came across the fossils at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile when he and his sister, Macarena were looking for decorative stones. They were playing at the site because their geologist parents, Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes mountain range. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. However, more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated, including four skeletons, which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits. The dinosaur has been likened to a platypus, which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, because it's one of very few mammal to lay eggs, has venomous spurs and a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver, as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck, among other idiosyncrasies. Most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey, but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of Chilesaurus was around 10 feet (three metres) long, according to Chilean and Argentinian palaeontologists from institutions including the University of Birmingham who have studied the skeletons. Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The dinosaur itself, has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance (illustrated) Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus, but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws, like the Velociraptor, for example. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. Most unusually, the animal was a vegetarian, despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs, which were mostly fierce meat eaters. The dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft (three metres) long. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division \u2013 Saurischia, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The different parts of the body of Chilesaurus were adapted to a particular diet and way of life, which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs. As a result of these habits, different regions of the body of Chilesaurus evolved resembling those present in other, unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs. 'Chilesaurus can be considered a \"platypus\" dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution,\u2019 Mart\u00edn Ezcurra, a researcher at the University of Birmingham explained. Painstaking: Close inspection of the fossils revealed that\u00a0Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod, the Velociraptor. The process of excavating the skeleton is shown . The presence of herbivorous theropods was, up until now, only known in close relatives of birds but Chilesaurus (illustrated left) shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Its fossils were found\u00a0at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile, marked with a red star on the map, right . \u2018In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures. \u2018Chilesaurus provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life. 'Chilesaurus shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups.\u2019 He believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones. Dr Fernando Novas, of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, led the research on Chilesaurus. Seven-year-old Diego Su\u00e1rez (pictured left) came across the fossils when he and his sister, Macarena, were looking for decorative stones. He was at the site while his his geologist parents, Manuel Suarez (pictured right) and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes . Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . He said: \u2018Chilesaurus is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere. \u2018Although plant-eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. \u2018Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. \u2018However, the recurrent discovery in beds of the Toqui Formation of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that Chilesaurus was, by far, the most abundant dinosaur in southwest Patagonia 145 million years ago.' The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping the unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller.

This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning \u2018beast-footed\u2019, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. Lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs.' 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. \u2018Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches.",

The pint-sized brunette is clearly keen to prove that there's no end to her talents - by designing yet another range for Lipsy. The actress and model has given fans a sneak peak of her stunning summer range ahead of the launch on Wednesday - and you can expect stunning summer dresses embellished with lace and feminine florals. Scroll down for video . Michelle Keegan has teased fashion fans with some items from her new Lipsy range, which will be landing in store on Wednesday . Michelle, 27, who is getting set to tie the knot with fiance Mark Wright, shows off her summer tan and enviable curves in the new campaign imagery. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating. The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months. As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace. Michelle, 27,  shows off her summer tan and enviable curves in the new campaign imagery . Michelle says her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin . Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range . The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle has been using the SoulMateFood delivery service and says she will be continuing the healthy eating plan when she comes back to Manchester while filming over the next couple of weeks. Loved by Daisy Lowe and Una Foden, the alkaline food delivery service allows you to create your own healthy menus, which are delivered straight to your front door. 'It's perfect for me as I am always on the go at the moment and I can always have it with me,' she said of the meal service. When she's cooking for herself at home, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.' In between posing in beauty shoots and designing her own Lipsy range, Michelle has been filming for new projects and is in talks for a new movie .",

        "text": "Help for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care. Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war, despite the fact that Mr Clark spent his \u00a350,000 life savings on contributing to his care. Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London . The JustGiving paged more than half of the \u00a35,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning . However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised \u00a32,736.22 of the \u00a35,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war \u00a0- and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than \u00a32,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the \u2018death march\u2019 in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain\u2019s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his \u00a350,000 savings to pay towards a \u00a3960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed \u00a3350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: \u2018This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. \u2018He\u2019s as good as told me that if he has to move, he\u2019ll just give up on life. Whenever he\u2019s been in hospital, he \u2026 pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. \u2018He hates being anywhere which isn\u2019t familiar \u2026 going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.\u2019 Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council\u2019s Phil Porter said: \u2018We recognise Mr Clark\u2019s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people \u2026 are in. \u2018However \u2026 the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.\u2019 He added: \u2018Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.\u2019 The council said Mr Clark\u2019s needs can be met in a care home for \u00a3451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: \u2018We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.\u2019 He added that the council had offered \u2018a deferred payment which means he doesn\u2019t need to sell his house to pay for his care\u2019. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark\u2019s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.",

        "text": "The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel \u2013 pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port \u2013 would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival . During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands \u2013 bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month \u2013 and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April\u201311 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago \u2013 Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline \u2013 the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay . You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival \u2013 its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear \u2013 on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war \u2013 plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century . The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey \u2013 around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels \u2013 another military-medical complex \u2013 have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here \u2013 the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag \u2013 laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery \u2013 a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel \u2013 armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource \u2013 over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here \u2013 just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle . The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen \u2013 a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker \u2013 which will also be accessible during the festival \u2013 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters \u2013 the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows \u2013 at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning \u2013 but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

However they were amazed to find the man had actually swallowed hundreds of coins and nails. Over a three year period Rajpal Singh, 34, had swallowed 140 coins, 150 nails and a handful of nuts, bolts and batteries. He had also gulped down screws, nails and magnets. Rajpal Singh, 34, had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of an ache. The image shows an X-ray with the mass of metal objects shown in white in his stomach . Doctors were amazed when an endoscopy (a long thin tube with a camera attached) revealed hundreds of foreign objects inside Mr Singh's stomach. The endoscopy is pictured . Over a three year period, Mr Singh had swallowed, 140 coins, 150 nails and nuts and bolts, batteries and magnets. Some of the objects removed are pictured . When doctors carried out an endoscopy \u2013 inserting a long, thin, tube with a camera attached to the end \u2013 it revealed the hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach. Mr Singh, a farmer from Bathinda in India's western state of Punjab, said his bizarre habit began after he fell into a depression, and eating metal objects brought him comfort. He said: 'I used to gulp down coins and metals with fruit juice or milk. 'Due to family problems I had slipped into depression and got hooked onto this weird habit. 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died. 'I feel much more relaxed now. I am never going to do this again.' Mr Singh claims he didn't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects. Doctors have carried out 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects, as well as a nine-hour operation. But Mr Singh will still need another procedure to remove the rest of the metal . Pictured are X-rays of Mr Singh's stomach, revealing the mass of foreign objects. Mr Singh said: 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died' Dr Gagendeep Goyal (pictured centre in blue) led a team of five doctors who carried out the operation to remove the objects from Mr Singh's abdomen . He went to many medical centres in Punjab complaining of a painful ache in his abdomen, but no doctors could diagnose the problem. Finally, Dr\u00a0Gagandeep\u00a0Goyal, a gastroentologist at a local hospital, carried out an X-ray and revealed the mass of metal deep in Mr Singh's stomach. He has since carried out more than 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects - yet some still remain. Leading a team of  five doctors, he also carried out a nine hour operation to remove more of the metal, yet Mr Singh will still need another operation to remove the rest. Dr Goyal said: 'The patient came to us with severe stomach pain. When we did the endoscopy we were shocked to see so many foreign bodies, including coins and sharp objects in his stomach. 'Though we have managed to remove most of them, there are still sharp injects and coins in his stomach. 'His body is too fragile to sustain another operation now so we plan to operate again in about seven days and remove the remaining objects.' Mr Singh says he feels calmer now and will not swallow metal objects again. Pictured are some coins removed from his stomach .",

        "text": "A Canadian prostitute says that she wishes  other people wouldn't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job. Celine Bisette, who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career, insists she is neither 'damaged' nor 'deranged' - that, in fact, she rather enjoys being a prostitute, and it's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy. 'I am embarrassed to be a sex worker, even though I like my job, I\u2019m good at it, and I\u2019ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years,' she wrote in a recent essay for xoJane. This pro has pride: Canadian prostitute Celine Bisette, pictured here, wishes other people wouldn't make her feel embarrassed about her job . First, Celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they've made about prostitutes. She claims that she didn't have an abusive childhood, she's not a 'hyper-sexual nympho', and she isn't uneducated. She had 'an incredibly fortunate upbringing', she said, adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister: '[It was] just about the best any child could possibly hope for.' Then, as a 19-year-old college sophomore, she found herself in need of a way to pay for school. A minimum-wage job wouldn't earn her enough money, and she didn't want to take out student loans. Her best option, she said, was the sex industry. 'I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do porn, and I knew wasn\u2019t talented enough to be a stripper,' she explained. Working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for Celine, as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills. It just didn't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision. In the beginning, she'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work. She was still out-going then, she said, and never felt self-conscious. But peoples' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job. They would lecture her, insult her, and accuse her of being a 'traitor to feminism'. One friend told everyone in their social circle that Celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career, and might have even been molested as a child. The rumor took off, and Celine lost a lot of friends in the process. Now, after about a decade in the industry, she is much more reticent about revealing what she does, for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions. But while she has a 'mainstream' part-time job that she uses as a 'cover', she finds it frustrating that she can't be more open. 'I wish I could feel proud of who I am and what I do,' she said. 'I\u2019m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed.' Sexy and smart: Celine, who wants to keep her real identity a secret, says she's more than just an escort - she also has her master's degree in sociology . Even when she does tell people about her work as an escort, Celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a\u00a0master\u2019s degree in sociology: 'I hype it up and draw attention to it, as if to say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m a [prostitute], but I\u2019m also smart and normal, really, I promise!\u201d' Because of the social stigma, she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy, her schedule is flexible, and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study. Plus, she explained, she can't erase her history in the sex industry. 'I will always be seen as damaged goods, whether I am a current sex worker or a former one. So I might as well just keep going, right?' In fact, despite liking her job, it's not Canada's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give Celine pause - being paid for sex is legal, but living off that payment of it is not. Rather, it's the negative reactions to her job that make her\u00a0regret ever taking up sex work at all. 'I wish I\u2019d known what I was getting myself into before I jumped into this line of work,' she said. 'But most of all, I wish I\u2019d never become a prostitute in the first place.'",

        "text": "Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton\" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is \"doing much better.\" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a \"snitch\" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge's ruling, Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. \"Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor,\" Knight's attorney argued. \"There's no intent to kill, there's an intent to survive.\" \"Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight,\" the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan \"needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor,\" Fletcher said. \"He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed.\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in \"mutual combat situation\" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight \"ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense,\" Barnes said. \"There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time.\" Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.",

In years following, it was really trial and error and learning the hard way.' Chapple revealed during the 2012 interview a motivation to preserve the way the world looks for his family. He told Landscape Photography Magazine 'The biggest moment of clarity as a photographer came with the birth of my first son, Radley Danger Chapple (yes, Danger really is his middle name). 'After a conversation with my father-in-law about how visibility in the mountains has decreased so much in his lifetime because of air pollution, I suddenly felt a real urgency to capture images that my children can share with their grandchildren.

It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised. IOSH executive director of policy Shelley Frost said: 'We've a clear picture for the UK now of the number of people diagnosed with or dying from skin cancer because of sun exposure at work. 'It's a terrible disease but with some simple measures we can ensure people who work outside are not exposed to the solar radiation that causes it.

        "text": "Washington (CNN)The U.S. said Tuesday that deploying warships to Yemen to monitor nearby Iranian vessels has given America \"options\" for how it could react to Iran's behavior in the region. The warships are being deployed to monitor ships traveling from Iran that could be trafficking arms to Houthi rebels in Yemen, U.S. officials told CNN, saying the move was also meant to reassure allies in the region. \"By having American sea power in the region, we have created options for ourselves,\" said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. He noted that the nine ships in the Iranian convoy were cargo ships, but he declined to specify what they were carrying beyond \"containers.\" International officials are concerned that Iran could surreptitiously attempt to transfer weaponry to the Houthis. President Barack Obama told MSNBC that the United States has been clear in its messages to Tehran on sending weapons to Houthi rebels inside Yemen. \"What we've said to them is if there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem,\" Obama said in the interview, a clip of which aired on NBC Nightly News. \"We're not sending them obscure messages, we send them very direct messages about it,\" Obama said. While the Iranian ships remain in international waters, the U.S. and other partner nations can keep an eye on the Iranian ships to see if they move toward Yemeni territorial waters. But it would be an extraordinary step and certainly not a foregone conclusion that the U.S. would attempt to board an Iranian ship if it entered Yemeni waters, U.S. officials said. \"I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships,\" State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Tuesday. \"The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe.\" Warren too added that he was unaware of any direct contact between the American and Iranian vessels at this point. The Obama administration and U.S. defense officials maintain the primary purpose of positioning additional U.S. warships in the region is to ensure the free flow of commerce through established international shipping lanes and to ensure maritime security in the region. There is a message for Iran as well. A U.S. military official told CNN that aircraft from aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are also conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" to monitor all maritime traffic moving through the area the Roosevelt is operating in to determine what is going on there in order to assist in making informed decisions. This official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships in the region was taken in order to assure the freedom of navigation through established international shipping lanes and ensuring maritime security and not to interdict Iranian ships. The Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the guided missile cruiser USS Normandy were the two ships the Navy moved into the waters off the coast of Yemen on Sunday. At this stage, there are nine U.S. naval ships operating off the coast in Yemen. \"The United States alongside the international community, including the United Nations, is serious about the Iranians not providing weapons to the Houthis,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. \"Providing weapons to the Houthis only exacerbates the violence and instability in this region in a way that will have continued terrible impact on the humanitarian situation in the country.\" The heightened tensions could have broader consequences for the relationship between the U.S. and Iran, coming weeks after the announcement of a framework agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program. Officials on Capitol Hill and elsewhere pointed out that the situation in Yemen adds an additional challenge when it comes to reaching a final deal. \"I don't think this changes something directly, but it does highlight that Iran has a number of activities around the region and around the world that are problematic,\" Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN Tuesday. \"It includes their missile program, it includes their growing influence in Iraq, it includes their propping up of (President Bashar al-) Assad in Syria and their fueling this war in Yemen.\" U.S. warships from the carrier group of the Roosevelt are joining allied vessels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other partner nations prepared to intercept a convoy of seven to nine Iranian vessels believed headed for Yemen. \"We are closely monitoring all maritime activity in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden,\" Cmdr. Kevin Stephens of the Fifth Fleet told CNN. \"We not going discuss the number and types of vessels we are monitoring or speculate about the possible destination or cargo of those vessels.\" When asked about warnings from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to keep Iranian navy ships away from Yemen, the commander of Iran's Regular Navy, Flotilla Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, said his fleet was operating legally. \"We don't let anyone give us warnings and threats, because we are working according to international law and regulations,\" he said. \"And we work for the security of our country and other countries.\" Sayyari added that Iranian navy ships in the area were there to combat piracy and secure the safe transfer of goods through the waters. U.S. ships do not have authority to forcibly board Iranian-flagged ships. Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy ship consensually boarded a Panamanian-flagged vessel suspected of trafficking people, drugs or weapons. Nothing was found. The U.S. warships come to a region seeing a good deal of U.S. military activity. The Roosevelt in particular only recently arrived in the theater and had been in the Arabian Gulf supporting Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria, according to Stephens. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on the \"Situation Room\" that he would only endorse U.S. air power against Yemen if it was the only option. \"It is a very serious escalatory step,\" he said on Monday. \"If you're going to use U.S. air power, what else is going to happen to make sure you stop the Houthis?\" McCain blamed President Barack Obama's foreign policy for the deteriorating situation. \"It was very obvious to many of us that this did not have to happen,\" McCain said. \"We did not take care of the regime that was in place, the president that was in there. It is a symptom of our failure throughout the Middle East.\" CNN's Jim Acosta, Frederik Pleitgen, Theodore Schleifer and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\u00a0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.",

The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman,\u00a0and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his\u00a0nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition\u00a0on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer\u00a0on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.",

Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust\u2019s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. \u2018He noted\u2026that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,\u2019 the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. \u2018But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people \u2018tune in\u2019 in new, digital ways. \u2018[Those ways] aren\u2019t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here \u2013 like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.\u2019 BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today\u2019s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. \u2018He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,\u2019 the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC\u2019s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new \u2018digital first\u2019 strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to \u2018learn lessons\u2019 if they want to \u2018compete with organisations that were born in the digital age\u2019.",

In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame\u00a071-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just \u00a3400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame \u2013 and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.",

The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed:\u00a0Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club.

Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos . Nervous:\u00a0Tunisian boat captain Mohammed Ali Malek (centre) bites his nails as he waits to disembark an Italian coastguard ship before being arrested over the deaths of 950 migrants who died when his ship sank .

He has been charged with\u00a0multiple manslaughter .

Malek was also pictured with his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who charged with 'aiding illegal immigration. Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile,\u00a0Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between \u20ac1million and \u20ac5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat.",

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011. North Korea has rejected accusations that it may have been behind the attack as a 'vicious' smear campaign by Seoul.

        "text": "(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3\u00bd  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.",

A purported unauthorized disclosure from an Army planner to a US representative who has demonstrated interest in the fate of American hostages held by al-Qaeda and the Taliban is currently under investigation. The disclosure led to the development of a plan to release a prominent Taliban member in exchange for US hostages, but it's not clear how far the plan went.",

He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices.

It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.",

        "text": "Tragedy: Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam died when he fell from a van while chasing a gang of thieves . A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,\u2019 he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll and\u00a0Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr\u00a0Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.",

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.",

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid \u2013 a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated.

Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe.

        "text": "(CNN)Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant, long-deceased relative who had owned slaves? Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline? I wouldn't, and neither did Ben Affleck, who lobbied producers of a PBS show, \"Finding Your Roots,\" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole, a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's, in an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. (Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.) Here's the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material: The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to Affleck's request, because when the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. Affleck's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck's request to delete the material, Lynton responded, \"all things being equal, I would definitely take it out.\" And on Tuesday, Affleck, via Facebook, admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck explained, \"I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.\" Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request, but it seems likely that he did. After all, Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates \"agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with.\" And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck's familial slave ownership connection. In any event, PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let's be clear: \"Finding Your Roots\" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It's not \"60 Minutes\" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers. There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  \"asked us to edit out something.\" After the emails were revealed, Gates issued a statement, saying, \"Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a Revolutionary War ancestor, a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964.\" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that's what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel \"vulnerable.\" Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his \"distant relative.\"  That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.",

        "text": "Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made \u00a372m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made \u00a372million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened \u2013 they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie\u00a0are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job \u2013 but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well \u2013 I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica \u00a0in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely,\u00a0Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.",

Ghermay has been sought on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead.

        "text": "After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups, former official Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up\u00a0during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions \u2013 a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to \"testimony\" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS\u2019 actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama\u2019s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated \u2013 but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner \u2013 and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal \u2013 was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS\u2019s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said. DOJ Letter to Boehner About Lois Lerner uploaded by DailyMail.com .",

The decision speaks to a legal gray area about whether it is a crime to refuse to provide testimony or answer questions during a congressional investigation. Machen's letter was released on Tuesday when he dropped a bombshell on Congress by stating that Lerner was within her legal rights to refuse to testify about her role in the IRS scandal that targeted conservative groups. The former IRS official has denied any wrongdoing and had made a self-serving opening statement during the hearing. The Obama administration has maintained that she was targeted by Republicans due to her role in the IRS scandal.

The comments, which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview, were some of the administration's strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. \"This is a problem that is off the charts historically,\" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. \"Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries.\" He concluded, \"We're in unchartered territory here.\" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. \"We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,\" he said. \"Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do.\" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. \"We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,\" McGurk said. \"They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,\" he acknowledged. \"But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani.\" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: \"The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up.\"",

The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon.\u00a0On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. A woman has been arrested in connection to the murder of 30-year-old Washington, DC lawyer David Messerschmitt. Above, the 'person of interest' who was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9. Police confirmed that this was Gallmon . Jamyra Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland and was an exemplary student, a teacher said on Thursday. According to an affidavit, it is believed that Mr\u00a0Messerschmitt got her to come to his hotel room believing that he was soliciting a man . Gallmon made an initial appearance on the felony murder charge Superior Court in DC on Thursday. The 21-year-old attended the Forestville Military Academy in Maryland, a coach toldFox 5\u00a0on Thursday and had been an exemplary student. She graduated in 2011. Her mother told NBC that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury.\u00a0He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 5.30pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime. On the left, another view of the person of interest on CCTV and on the right, Messerschmitt. Police sources told NBC Washington that the woman in the surveillance video is Gallmon . Messerschmitt texted his wife Kim Vuong on February 9 that he would be home in an hour but never showed. It appears he had gone to the Donovan hotel after arranging to have sex with an individual on Craigslist who he believed to be a man . Gallmon's mother said that her 21-year-old daughter (pictured) had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. She told police she stabbed the lawyer multiple times, according to an affidavit . Last week, Messerchmitt's wife gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife.\u00a0He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law. Emotional: Last week, Messerschmitt's wife, Kim Vuong, held a press conference, asking for help in locating her husband's killer .

        "text": "Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country\u2019s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital\u2019s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I\u2019m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe \u2013 the first for 20 years \u2013 supports the cushy lifestyle claim.\u00a0There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating\u00a0his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from\u00a0type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims\u2019 families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe\u2019s second victim, said: \u2018He tore apart our family and this just looks like he\u2019s being rewarded. He\u2019s getting an easy life and he\u2019s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how many years go by, it doesn\u2019t make the pain of what he did any easier.\u2019 Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than \u00a3300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.",

        "text": "English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the\u00a0language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new\u00a0legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors\u00a0and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar\u00a0checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the\u00a0Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English\u00a0language\u00a0experience - such as\u00a0from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.",

        "text": "Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'",

The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more.

The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety.

Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added.

But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support.

'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that.

Jet Set Candy, which offers a collection of destination-specific charms aimed at helping people to choose where they should head on their travels, enables you to take your pick of Britain\u2019s Royals with the\u00a0Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm, giving users eight possibilities for a 'future husband' - including 'King-to-be George'. 'Fancy your chances with Prince Harry? Got eyes for a Duke? Tie the knot with a British Royal and go from commoner to Queen. Your palace awaits!' reads the description of the fanciful charm, which comes\u00a0in 14K gold vermeil or sterling silver for $198 and $148, respectively. Here's hoping: Jewelry brand Jet Set Candy's Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm comes in 14K gold vermeil (L) and sterling silver (R) and retails for $198 and $148, respectively . Eligible bachelor: Prince Harry is one of the eight 'future husbands' listed on the charm's playful spinner wheel . The charm has a double-sided Wheel of Fortune-style spinner, allowing wearers to predict their fate with one quick spin. While the front lists one-year-old Prince George and 30-year-old Prince Harry, as well as other more generic options such as \u2018Duke\u2019, \u2018Marquess\u2019, \u2018Earl\u2019, \u2018Viscount\u2019, \u2018Baron\u2019 and \u2018Commoner\u2019, as the options for your future husband, the flip side offers eight 'future homes', allocating you anything from a palace, castle or estate to an abbey, manor, house, cottage \u2013 or even foreclosure. Meanwhile, the charm silently acknowledges that 32-year-old Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate, is already taken - by not mentioning him at all. The jewelry brand, which is perfect for anyone who has the travel bug, also sells similar spinner charms for other cities, as well as various destination pendants, luggage tag charms, link bracelets, engraved bangles and more. Jet Set Candy's founder and designer Nicole Parker King launched the collection in 2014 after traveling on six different continents and nearly 50 countries .

Same concept: The Caribbean Sailing Spinner (L) and the\u00a0NYC Planner Spinner (R) are variations of the unique charm. Both pieces come in\u00a014K gold vermeil and sterling silver . The sixth generation New Yorker recently moved back to Manhattan after living in New Delhi for nearly four years with her husband Chris, who was posted their as an Australian\u00a0diplomat. But despite all of her travels, Nicole never came across her version of the perfect\u00a0souvenir, so she took it\u00a0upon herself to create it. Despite all of her travels, Nicole was never able to find the perfect souvenir to take home from her trips, so decided to make them on her own. And her dedication to reinventing travel keepsakes that are both cheeky and classic has paid off. Model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner sported her brand's Amsterdam Windmill Ring in a spread featured in the February issue of Vogue. Family event: Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate (pictured together last month), is already taken and therefore not featured on the charm .

Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer,\u00a0@AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'",

In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader\u2019s personal character \u2013 after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign \u2018into the gutter\u2019. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight\u2019s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage\u2019s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent.

Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.",

But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead, with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today\u2019s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls, enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least \u00a070. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent, but that compared with a four-point deficit for Ed Miliband's Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror, while the Conservatives dipped one, to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader - despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent - will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said last week that \u2018a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine\u2019 given Labour\u2019s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain\u2019 s membership of the European Union. \u2018Labour would be tough on business \u2013 and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,\u2019 the US giant said in the report. \u2018A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK\u2019s EU membership. \u2018Whoever wins \u2013 and the result could take some time to emerge \u2013 will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.\u2019 BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be \u2018harrowing for the UK\u2019.",

Currently, a total of 215,462 licences exist compared to the 177,675 owned in 2010, according to figures obtained by News Corp. Tamworth, 403km north of Sydney, was revealed to have the most number of firearm licences - 3259 - with Bathurst, 200km west of Sydney, a close second at 3075. Currently, a total of 215,462 licences exist in New South Wales compared to the 177,675 owned in 2010. Pictured: NSW police busted an illegal firearm operation in the Casino and Lismore areas last month . Both suburbs saw an increase of almost 500 guns in their areas over the last five years. Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'.

The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports\u00a0Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'",

Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult\u2019s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed.

Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: \u2018Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.\u2019 A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be\u00a0anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say \"shaped\", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'",

        "text": "Nine council workers have been sacked for inappropriately accessing confidential social work files on tragic toddler Mikaeel Kular. The three-year-old was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya, who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife, in January last year. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular's (left) confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high-profile case without permission. Adekoya, who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine, was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister's home. Investigations found her internet history included searches 'I find it hard to love my son', 'I love all of my children except one', 'why am I so aggressive with my son' and 'get rid of bruises'. Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial, the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 \u2013 the month before Mikaeel's death. Tragic: Scores of tributes were left near to the youngster's home in Edinburgh following a massive search to find him . Grim discovery: The three-year-old's body was found in woodland behind his auntie's house in Fife . However, Adekoya was not on the radar of social workers in Edinburgh, despite having moved to the Scottish capital. Craig Munro, Executive Director of Education and Children's Services at Fife council said: . 'We have a clear internal process for dealing with discipline issues and we don't comment publicly on the individual circumstances of staff.' A seperate investigation into whether Mikaeel's death could have been prevented is due to be published in a matter of weeks. Police Scotland said they would not be taking the matter further. A spokesman said: 'No criminal complaint had been made so we consider it an internal matter for Fife Council.'",

        "text": "Rape: Edwin 'Jock' Mee is accused of attacking several Army cadets while working as a recruitment sergeant . An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly told the 18-year-old, from Sierra Leone, that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee, 46, as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said: 'He was like someone I could really lean on because, going for some interviews with him, he would ask me everything about my personal life, everything, because he said that is the procedure they need to do. 'So it is like I took him as a father, or someone I can relate to, or maybe understand what is happening to me.' Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him - she initially ignored him, but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee, he slapped her bottom as she left the office, and she told him 'never do that'. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied: 'He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him, and his status, all these things, I believed him.' Describing the alleged rape, the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office, and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said: 'He said there was a delay for me to pay the money, that if the visa didn't come, I can't go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. 'He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office, and he told me that he was going to help and I said, \"How are you going to do that?\" He just said, \"A call that I can make,\" and I said \"Why don't you do it?\" 'He said: \"You know what you can do that will make me do it.\"' Base: Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the 'boss' who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later, told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area, jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform, Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office, before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said: 'He came back and sat, he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him.' Jurors heard that she told Mee 'no' and that she was simply there to see the 'boss', still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know, and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then 'jumped' and kissed her on the lips, before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her, before she told him that she could not breathe. 'I was suffocating because he was on top of me,' the woman said. 'And I told him that I was suffocating, he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me, because I wasn't breathing.' After the incident Mee drove the woman home, telling her not to tell anyone what had happened, and said that he was helping her out, the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was 'a big person in the Army' and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards, the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted, and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant: Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee, who now lives in Scotland, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped, she said: 'Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. 'Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me, if they don't agree he said he will marry me. LOL. 'That is so sweet of him. God, please don't let anything happen to me.' In cross-examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her 'jokingly or seriously'. 'That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought, because he is telling me all these things that I wasn't aware of,' she replied. In another entry a few days later, she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote: 'I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he didn't call, they should have refused me.' Asked why she hadn't told anyone of the rape, the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said: 'He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child doesn't know that you are abusing it, and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt.' The trial continues.

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour.

        "text": "As Zlatan Ibrahimovic famously believes the World Cup is 'nothing to watch' without him, he's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. For most people, Barcelona's progress into the Champions League semi-final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography 'I am Zlatan'. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi (left) and\u00a0Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates, including David Luiz, pictured, face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33, Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet, he'll walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team-mates he'd played with, he named himself up front with Messi \u2013 ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. 'Football isn't something you plan in advance. It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him \u00a3200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to \u00a350million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with\u00a0Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance \u2013 except for Zlatan himself.",

        "text": "Jameela\u00a0spent \u00a33,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent \u00a33,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of\u00a0fillings in\u00a0the average\u00a0adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",

The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the \"smart bullets\" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman \"repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,\" a DARPA statement said. \"Additionally,\" the statement said, \"a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target.\" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. \"True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,\" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. \"This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,\" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.",

        "text": "A clean-water advocate took an Earth Day swim in New York City's polluted Gowanus Canal, a site designated by the federal government as especially polluted, but quit less than halfway through. Christopher Swain wore a protective yellow suit as he went over a railing and into the water around 2pm Wednesday in Brooklyn but completed only two-thirds of a mile of the 1.8-mile waterway. He swam about an hour into the canal in  a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water's pollution because the experience was like 'swimming 'in a dirty diaper'. Christopher Swain, a clean-water activist, embarked on a 1.8-mile swim in the toxic Gowanus Canal, which has been designated as especially polluted by the Environmental Protection Agency, to urge its cleanup . The swimmer, who quit two-thirds of a mile into the swim, gargled hydrogen peroxide periodically to prevent contaminated water from getting down his throat . Swain, who has previously swam the Hudson and Columbia Rivers, said that cleanup of the Gowanus Canal, which was labelled as a Superfund site by the EPA, should be accelerated . 'It's probably the safest move at this point,' he said, according to Reuters, but pledged to swim the whole canal one day. 'I want to make it clear, no one is telling me to stop,' Swain continued, and said that impending bad weather played a role in his decision. The activist said 'It's not safe to swim in there,' according to Gothamist. He said that the water tasted 'Like mud, poop, ground-up grass, detergent and gasoline'. The 19th-century canal was once a major transportation route, but it's now so polluted with industrial and sewer discharges that it must, by law, be cleaned up. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says contaminates include PCBs, which were banned in the US in 1979. It warned Swain against taking the swim, posting a message on its Twitter account saying that it 'strongly advises AGAINST swimming' in the strip of water. The agency issued guidelines in 2011 saying that people should 'never swim in the canal', which runs over 1\u00bd miles through a narrow industrial zone near increasingly wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn. It urged anyone who came in contact with the water to seek medical attention immediately if they felt sick. Crowds gathered on bridges along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn as Swain was accompanied by a woman in a red kayak . The activist has previously swam the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia River in Washington to bring attention to water issues . Swain waves to the crowds who came to see him swim but were disappointed when he only made it two-thirds of a mile. A baby whale once got lost in the canal in 2007 and died within two days . After heavy rainstorms excess water from the sewer system flows in the canal, where  raw sewage and human excrement that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. An estimated 377million gallons of diluted raw sewage pour into the canal each year. 'There's a lot of poop in there,' Swain said after his swim, according to the\u00a0New York Post. Dissolved arsenic in the water is thought to be at a level 60 times higher than that harmful to human health. A baby whale became lost in the canal in 2007 and was nicknamed Sludgie by locals. It died in two days. After rainstorms it can often be found with raw sewage that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. However Swain, who has previously done long swims along the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia in Washington, wanted to call attention to the slow clean up of the canal and urge for it to be accelerated. An estimated 377million gallons of sewage is poured into the Gowanus Canal every year. Above, trash pollutes the Brooklyn inlet in 2013 . The pollution in the Gowanus Canal combines decades of industrial dumping and general trash. It is particularly filthy after rainstorms . He gargled hydrogen peroxide to fight against any bacteria entering his body and had charcoal tablet to take that will help if he did, according to CityLab. Swain told reporters after he got out that he did not swallow any water. He was accompanied by a woman in a kayak, paddling a few feet away from him before he called it quits. Swain posted on Twitter that swimming in the canal is his 'federal right' under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Gowanus was labeled a Superfund site in 2010, with the EPA later saying that cleaning it up would take up to ten years and $506million, according to\u00a0DNA Info. Costs will mostly fall on the city and companies that used to be along the canal such as National Grid. The agency plans on beginning dredging in the canal in 2017, which involves cleaning out 600,000 cubic yards of contaminated mud. Before Wednesday's failed effort, Swain also planned on swimming other polluted waters, such as the Bronx River and Newtown Creek, which runs between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. He said he has hope that New York's polluted waterways will one day be clean enough for swimmers without protective suits. The water advocate claims that it is his 'federal right' to swim in the canal under the Clean Water Act of 1972 .

But after a spending spree on the trip, Armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch, extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage. A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to 'startle and repel'. Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it. Judge John Milford QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs. 'What he did was foolish. It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items. 'A stun gun is, within the legislation of this country, a firearm. It is an extremely serious offence to possess one. 'It is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country.' The 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with \u00a32,000 costs at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) The judge said a prison sentence was not necessary in Armstrong's case as there was no suggestion he would use the weapons, had never been in trouble before and had recently found employment. Judge Milford added: 'He had an extremely good job lined up. As a consequence of these proceedings, which he had to reveal to his perspective employers, he lost that job.' As such, Armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with \u00a32,000 costs. Glen Gatland, defending, said; 'He has never been in trouble with the police and is of previous good character. 'He went on holiday to Cyprus with four friends (in the summer of 2013) who had been to primary school together. 'The reason he went was because he had been offered a job as IT project manager with retail branches in London and Zurich. 'He would have been moving away and not able to see his friends.' The court heard three of the friends who had been on the holiday with Armstrong received warnings after batons and knuckle dusters were found in their luggage. Mr Gatland said the weapons were bought from a 'corner shop' in Cyprus and Armstrong had been given the knuckle duster free with his other purchases.",

Speaking about the Terry race row for the first time since leaving his post as England manager, Capello said England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea stalwart at their disposal. \u2018I think John is England\u2019s best defender and they have not got a lot of defenders,\u2019 said Capello, \u2018It is better to have a player like John than not have him.\u2019 Fabio Capello insists defender John Terry should never have been stripped of the England captaincy . Capello claims England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea star at their disposal . The Italian was in charge of the national side when Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, the brother of then England teammate Rio, during a Chelsea match against QPR in October 2011. He was stripped of his captaincy by the Football Association after being charged by police. Capello resigned as England Manager in February 2012 just two days after publicly criticising the FA\u2019s decision and obviously remains bitter about the whole affair. He believes Terry should have kept his role under the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven. \u2018I fought for John to be able to come back and play but they [the Football Association] said \u201cno you can\u2019t decide about the player, you need to wait for the court decision,\u201d and I said \u201cWhy?\u201d But they had already decided before I asked. John Terry was caught up in a race controversy with then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011 . Chelsea captain Terry, who has 78 England caps, retired from international football in September 2012 . Asked if it was time to persuade Terry, who has been a permanent fixture in the Chelsea side bound for the Premier League title, to come back into the England fold, Capello - speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards - directed his ire at the FA. \u2018You know what happened with me, they decided he could not play with the national team and I didn\u2019t understand because he was not guilty. \u2018When it happened I said to the President [David Bernstein] \u201cYou decided he\u2019s guilty?\u201d No he\u2019s not guilty, it\u2019s good you can play with the national team and I don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t play.\u2019 Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand in a criminal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court but retired from international football in September 2012 after the FA pursued their own charges. An FA hearing found Terry, who has 78 England caps, guilty of using insulting words which included a reference to Anton Ferdinand\u2019s colour or race and he was banned for four matches and fined \u00a3220,000, . Terry, 34, said he was \u2018deeply hurt\u2019 by the incident and will never play for England again. Capello agreed his international career was probably over. \u2018I don\u2019t think he has the chances to play with the national team more,\u2019 said Capello, \u2018But I saw some young players that played with me are improving. [Chris] Smalling is playing and [Phil] Jones. I\u2019m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well.\u2019 The Chelsea defender was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA .",

        "text": "(CNN)This is a difficult but necessary thing to say: Incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed African-Americans are unlikely to end soon. That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a \"moment.\" And it's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it. This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis. The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over. The violent response of police officers to unarmed African-Americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as \"race card\" politics and black grievance. But this year's spate of killings and assaults, from Ferguson, Missouri, to North Charleston, South Carolina, to most recently Baltimore, are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the  African-American community. So what makes now different? The advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally. As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans as has happened in the past. To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. A true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions. The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. How do we face this crisis? First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias, encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community, especially young people. Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles. President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing, like education, is a function of state and local government. And it's true that his options are limited. And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities. How? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. In contrast, while the Department of Justice provides more than $1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country, those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training, data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus. That must change. Also, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination. Such investigations doubled to more than 20 under Attorney General Eric Holder, but given the nearly 30,000 police departments spread across the country, this is woefully inadequate. It's been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination. The results in places such as Seattle and Cincinnati, where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices, are promising. But the $12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance. Much has been made of rogue police officers, \"bad apples\" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. Ultimately, the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally, including who we decide to recruit to serve. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm, for example, has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives. That thinking reflects a spirit of adventure, he told me, rather than a spirit of service. Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. Those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness, courage and smarts, but also integrity, maturity, empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve. A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality. Until we see that kind of wholesale engagement, the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance.",

        "text": "8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is \u2018shameful\u2019 to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. \u2018People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.\u2019 Ending screening at 73 \u2018doesn\u2019t take account of the fact that ageing is changing\u2019, adds Nat Lievesley. \u2018It\u2019s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.\u2019 Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

        "text": "The possession police are out in force, and Jose Mourinho is the Premier League\u2019s Most Wanted. The football purists are foaming at the mouth \u2013 how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football? Is this the most negative side to ever win the title? Is this the most terrible team to lift the Champions\u2019 crown? Woah there, just hang on a moment. Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United . Mourinho and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over United on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . I\u2019m no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United. But at the end of the season, they are getting the job done, it\u2019s as simple as that. And who can blame Mourinho for being so cautious? Last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace \u2013 both in the bottom half of the table at the time, and were beaten at home by Sunderland, who were six points adrift in 20th place. And then needing a win to go top of the Premier League with just two games to go, Mourinho watched his side draw 0-0 at home to Norwich, who were about to be relegated. The title that had been in their grasp, was lost. Chelsea\u2019s most impressive result during that run-in was a 2-0 win at Liverpool, a game made famous by Steven Gerrard\u2019s slip. It ended Liverpool\u2019s 16-match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title. That day Chelsea let Liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes. Chelsea found a way to win without the ball. And Mourinho did the same on Saturday to an in-form Manchester United, who had 70 per cent possession at Stamford Bridge. It\u2019s not my kind of football \u2013 I like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball. And so does Louis van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Steven Gerrard slips against Chelsea at Anfield last season - a game Chelsea won with only 17% possession . Ba scores as Chelsea go on to win at Anfield and effectively end Liverpool's title push last season . The Dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit. All clubs have injuries, but for that massive game on Saturday, United needed key players in the team. It would have been fascinating to see if Van Gaal\u2019s possession philosophy would have won the day, over the Jose way. Chelsea won the game, and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion \u2013 by not wanting possession of the football. Jose has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season. I understand his pragmatism given that Chelsea are so close to sealing the title. But he fell into this negativity way too early in the season, and it led to their abject failure in Europe. Mourinho needs to be more expansive in the Champions League next season \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal against Burnley after a sublime pass from Cesc Fabregas was a highlight of the season . But don\u2019t judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone: they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style, but they have had some wonderful moments this season. On day one of the season Cesc Fabregas\u2019 sublime disguised pass for Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal at Burnley had us all out of our seats. It wasn\u2019t his only example of genius since August. When fit, Diego Costa\u2019s strength, movement and finishing have been a joy to watch. And then there\u2019s Eden Hazard. The player Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, Samir Nasri and Raheem Sterling and others all dream of being. Yes some of those others have medals, but they haven\u2019t shown the same amazing ability as the Chelsea number 10. His balance, his control, his passing and finishing have all been superb all season. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Oscar (second left) scores against Swansea as Chelsea run riot at the Liberty Stadium in January . And during this period when Jose Mourinho is being over-cautious, making sure they secure the title they let slip last season, Hazard has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity, to one capable of star quality. And back in January, Chelsea gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the Premier League when they went to Swansea and won 5-0. The one-touch football was special, and the way the three behind Costa drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of Rinus Michels\u2019 Ajax and Holland sides of the 1970s. Chelsea were 4-0 in front at the break, by which time Willian had also hit the bar twice. Jose\u2019s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division. So don\u2019t be too harsh on Chelsea, on their way to the title it\u2019s hell to watch them right now. But Mourinho\u2019s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs.",

        "text": "Two passenger jets allegedly came within 25 seconds of a mid-air collision over the Arabian Sea. One of the carriers involved, Dubai-based Emirates, referred to the apparent near-miss as an 'air traffic control incident' in a statement on Wednesday. Neither the Dubai carrier nor Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways would say how close the two planes came to each other. However a Resolution Advisory (RA) was given to both planes, which means the distance between the two aircraft could have resulted in a collision within 25 seconds. Etihad have maintained that the safety of its passengers was never compromised after it came 'within 25 seconds of collision' with an Emirates plane . The incident occurred on Monday as passenger planes from Emirates and Etihad Airways were traveling in opposite directions between the Gulf and the island nation of Seychelles. Both carriers have recently rerouted flights to the archipelago nation to avoid Yemeni airspace due to fighting there. Emirates says its flight EK709 was returning from the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles when the incident occurred  in airspace controlled from Mumbai, India. Etihad Airways separately says it is investigating 'a reported incident' involving one of its planes traveling in the opposite direction. Both carriers insist safety was not compromised. This graphic shows the time in seconds of being at risk of traffic collision for each of the emergency warnings . The incident involving the Etihad Airways and Etihad occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai airspace . Indian news broadcaster NDTV\u00a0report that there was 'an emergency warning by the planes' on board collision avoidance systems,' and that both pilots reported the incident to Mumbai air traffic controllers. A Traffic Advisory (TA) is sounded to an aircraft when they are within 40 seconds of traffic in a particular airspace. Following this an RA is then given out if an aircraft is at risk of collision within 25 seconds, and the pilot has six seconds to respond. The Seychelles News Agency confirmed both planes received a \u2018Resolution Advisory\u2019 or RA, from the on-board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The incident occurred over the Arabian sea when the two planes were passing each other . An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'Etihad Airways has strongly rejected claims that the safety of flight EY622, Abu Dhabi to the Seychelles, was compromised. 'The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), which is fitted on all aircraft, ensured that safe vertical separation of both aircraft was maintained at all times. 'Etihad Airways has provided its safety reports to the GCAA and is assisting with its investigation as well as conducting its own investigation into the incident. 'Safety is Etihad Airways' number one priority.' A statement released by Emirates to the Times of India read: 'Emirates can confirm that flight EK 706 on March 29 from Seychelles to Dubai was involved in an air traffic control incident in Mumbai airspace. At no point was the aircraft, passengers or crew at risk. 'All Emirates aircraft are equipped with onboard instrumentation so that crew are alerted in a timely manner of all surrounding traffic. The crew informed the authorities of the incident and later filed an Air Safety Report, which will be forwarded to Mumbai Air Traffic Control. Safety is of paramount importance to Emirates, and we will be cooperating fully with the Mumbai Air Traffic Control in the subsequent investigation.' Both Etihad Airways and Emirates operate multiple flights every week to the Seychelles . Emirates and Etihad have both grown rapidly in recent years, enticing long-haul transit passengers through their Gulf hubs aboard relatively young aircraft. Emirates is owned by the government of Mideast commercial hub Dubai, while Etihad is controlled by the oil-rich Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. Both carriers are regulated by the Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority, which had no immediate comment. They each operate multiple flights weekly to Seychelles, a tropical tourism destination that has built close ties to the Emirates.",

But one Los Angeles resident can offer fans an even more intense taste of the singer's life, by letting them sleep in his house. Cobain lived in this two bedroom apartment on Spaulding Avenue in L.A.'s Fairfax district during the height of Nirvana-mania. Scroll down for video . The two-bedroom apartment is inside a 1920's building on Spaulding Avenue L.A.'s Fairfax district. A picture taken of Kurt Cobain in the early 90s, sitting on the end of the double bed he shared with Courtney Love. And with a parrot resting on his head, of course. The graffiti, however, has long since disappeared . Now its current owner, Brandon Kleinman, 31, has listed it on Airbnb. He wrote on the page advertising it: 'The place is the perfect combination of comfort, style, location and...rock n' roll history. 'Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lived in the home during the height of Nirvana's musical influence 91-92 to be specific. 'At the time, Kurt was focused on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. 'He (Cobain) was particularly into painting during this time and even decorated the walls in the living room and bedroom.' 'His\u00a0favourite\u00a0spot in the house: the bathtub. In it, he wrote the song 'Heart-Shaped Box.' The couple lived in the apartment in 1991 and 1992, just before Frances Bean Cobain was born . It is described as 'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992 . According to Charles R. Cross's 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, the singer and his wife rented the unit for $1,100 (\u00a3727) a month. During the time they lived there, Love was pregnant with Frances Bean Cobain, while Cobain was focusing on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for $4,5654 (\u00a33,016) a month, or $1,142 (\u00a3754) a week (which works out at about $163/\u00a3108 per night). Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for \u00a33016 a month, or \u00a3108 a night . Up to three guests can stay in one bedroom of the 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath flat. One of four homes inside a 1920's building, it offers a large living room with seating, a dining area and a small but fully stocked kitchen. It is described as  'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992, which showed graffiti on the walls and rubbish scattering every available surface. The rooms where Cobain stayed have undergone a full renovation since he lived there . Cobain moved out when Love was eight months pregnant after a leak in the bathtub damaged the guitars, music and other\u00a0possessions\u00a0he stored there. Since then the place has been fully renovated and much of the idol's artwork has been covered up. Mr Kleinman told Vulture magazine: 'There's latex painting over the fireplace' It's owner suspects art painted by Cobain is hidden under layers of paint on the apartment's walls . 'I know there's tons of art painted on the actual mantel of the fireplace. I want to see if there's a way to get under the layered paint, to see what he painted under there.' 'I tried to get to the original hardwood floor in the hallway, but I can't,' he said. 'It's damaged because the bathtub leaked while Kurt and Courtney lived here. That's why they moved out.' The apartment is located in the middle of LA, five minutes from shopping mecca The Grove .",

        "text": "(CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community.  \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.",

Caught: Fetters first started messaging the boy when he was 12 and the texts turned sexual last year . Fired: The 28-year-old Spanish teacher was fired after students told staff that the boy had photos of her . Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher on January 30. When two school principals approached him during a school sporting event, he allegedly deleted the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to recover them. During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad.

So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class. Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations. The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South.

Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper\u2019s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted:\u00a0Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured,\u00a0Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.",

In a deal agreed with the British government, they will also continue to work for the Royal Navy and draw their current pay. It was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the British High Commission who was in court refused to elaborate. The four \u2013 Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer, Craig Stoner, 24, Simon Radford, 31, and Darren Smalley, 35 \u2013 had been playing for the Royal Navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the Shearwater naval base just east of Halifax. The alleged sexual assault, in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim, took place on April 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game. Sources say their victim, who is aged in her early 20s and lives in Halifax, had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local Canadian servicemen.

The four, no longer trying to hide their faces, later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white SUV to their new home on the close Stadacona base. They ignored a question over how they might plead in the case.

        "text": "When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school . His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months . But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world \u2026 and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like \"what have you got?\" and I'd say \"I think I have psychosis or depression\" and they'd just say \"OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?\" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun . 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that.

It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy . 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!'

The UCO Stormproof Matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them and will start burning again once they come into contact with oxygen. The unique matches have to go through rigorous testing to make sure they keep alight in even the most difficult situations. Scroll down for video . Indestructable: The UCO Stormproof Matches (pictured) are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to it and will start burning again once it comes into contact with oxygen . Eric Moe, the product specialist at Industrial Revolution which owns Utility, Comfort and Originality (UCO), explained the process. The Stormproof matches are made by UCO which has been making outdoor accessories for the past 44 years. They include 25 matches in a completely waterproof case with and three strike pads. The matches cost \u00a35.47 ($7.99) from UCO's website and are available from the UK distributor Dalesman International.

'Essentially, you aren't burning the match stick, but burning the coating on the stick. 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose. 'In all cases the flame keeps burning. The matches will still ignite if they get wet, and they are quite impact resistant.' Even when buried in sand (left), the matches can burn again once they are taken out and exposed to oxygen (right). They can also keep smouldering even while underwater .

He said: 'Whether they're in a snowstorm, rainstorm or wind storm, the UCO Stormproof Matches will offer heat and light. 'The importance of being able to create a fire in inclement weather cannot be overstated. 'These matches are designed to ignite and keep burning in the worst conditions.

Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily, 14, were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police questioned mother and daughter and now consider the case closed after releasing them. Iona called her mother at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning to tell her she was ok. 'I'm thankful my daughter is safe. She's had a lot of pressure,' Iona's mother, Diana Malcolmson, told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get away.' Iona claimed she had no idea friends and family members were worried about her sudden disappearance, her mother said. 'She hadn't listened to the news. She didn't know she was causing all this trouble,' Malcolmson said. Iona is in the midst of a nasty battle over the will of her husband, George Costello Sr., 63, who died of a heart attack as he was working on a Southampton barge on Dec. 28, 2012. News of Iona's reappearance comes after more details emerged about the colorful background of her late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News\u00a0reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello's family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead moved to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello's aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.",

A father was asked to leave a Wetherspoon pub for a family breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms. David Curry, 49, had travelled ten miles from  home to visit The Wallow in Blyth, Northumberland, for the first time with wife Vee, 45, and her daughter Kayleigh. But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of \u00a340 Adidas trousers.

        "text": "ALL DAY LONG . By Joanna Biggs . (Serpent\u2019s Tail \u00a314.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work / Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough / To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - \u00a3320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.",

The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI\u2019s Muslim Students\u2019 Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to \u2018participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events\u2019. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was \u2018a mistake\u2019 to call off the screening. \u2018The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,\u2019 Harper\u2019s statement read. \u2018We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.\u2019 An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper.

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought \u2013 and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it\u2019s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don\u2019t place myself in the same \"situations\" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf?

The last time I went to LA it was my friend\u2019s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqu\u00e9 shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie \u2013 something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It\u2019s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends.

'Our target is to get through this round and reach the semi-finals, and if we qualify 1-0 or 1-1 (on aggregate), that's all the same to me,' said Allegri, whose side are at home in the quarter-final first leg on Tuesday. 'It could be a boring game, the important thing is not to concede a goal at home.' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri strolls in to his pre-match press conference on Monday . The Juventus squad look relaxed as they are put through their paces in sunny Turin . Allegri warned that Monaco, who have conceded only four goals in eight games on their way to the quarter-finals, would be a completely different proposition to Borussia Dortmund, who Juventus beat 5-1 on aggregate in the last 16. 'The tie against Monaco is much more complicated than the one against Dortmund,' he said. 'They are two very different teams, the French side concede few goals and it's always more complicated to play against a team that doesn't go forward very often.

We need patience, humility and intelligence, and to realise that we are not going to settle qualification in Turin. 'I think they (Monaco) have richly deserved to get to the quarter finals,' added Allegri. 'They conceded one goal in six games during the group stage, eliminating Benfica and Zenit St Petersburg. In Ligue 1, they have the best defence with 22 goals conceded (in 32 games). These figures do not come by chance.' Experienced defender Giorgio Chiellini smiles as he talks to the media on Monday afternoon . Allegri said that playmaker Andrea Pirlo had been included in the squad after recovering from a calf muscle injury, and he now had to decide whether the 35-year-old could be plunged into the tie after a seven-week lay-off. 'Pirlo hasn't played for more than 40 days, I'll decide after the last training session,' he said.",

Sturridge will again be absent for Tuesday night's trip to Hull and while Rodgers will not take the drastic step of calling time on his campaign, he remains unsure whether the England international will play again this season. The 25-year-old missed five months with calf and thigh issues and he is now battling to overcome a hip problem that was sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Daniel Sturridge may not play again this season because of a series of calf and thigh injuries . Sturridge will miss Liverpool's trip to face Hull City on Tuesday night because of injury problems . Rodgers concedes it has been a difficult year for Sturridge but maintains Liverpool's medical department will continue to nurse him back to full fitness; the manager is also determined to bring in players to ease the burden on him next season. 'It had been difficult for Daniel,' said Rodgers. 'He wants to work and play. We are just going to have to monitor it. He is a good lad and when he had been fit, he has been brilliant for us. 'He is not available, we will do what is in the best interest of him. He is going to be here for the next number of years. 'There are always names associated. It is certainly something that we need to address. Daniel is top class but we need to give him help. 'You are nearly talking about a 100 per cent deficit. We have had 14 clean sheets. That side of the game has been addressed but we need to improve the critical area.' Manchester United's defeat at Everton on Sunday has, in the words of Louis van Gaal, given Liverpool 'a glimmer of light' in the race for the top four and United's advantage could be down to one point by the time they next play.

        "text": "Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in Tom Brokaw's very large footsteps at NBC, according to a new report. The network handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003. But according to a report in Vanity Fair,\u00a0Williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about Brokaw, whom he succeeded at Nightly News in 2004. 'I always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities,' one executive told the publication. Clash: Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams are pictured in New York in 2004 - the year Williams took over Brokaw's role on the Nightly News. A new report has claimed Williams always felt insecure following him . 'And he had to follow Tom, which brought its own set of insecurities. He likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales... I just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality.' But according to former correspondents who spoke to Vanity Fair, Brokaw wasn't so accepting of the 'quirks'. The stories left him 'incensed', the publication reported. On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day. On hearing the tale, Brokaw went into 'spasms of anger', one former exec told Vanity Fair. 'Tom treated that anchor chair as a public trust,' a former employee said. 'He really was our Walter Cronkite.' Others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after Williams took over the role because even though Brokaw pushed for him to get the job, Williams never 'embraced' him. 'I don't know why,' a source said. '[Williams] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did Tom, so he never tries. That's the reason there's not a lot of support for Brian over there.' Exaggerations: During a report in February, pictured, Williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a Chinook that came under fire while in Iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft . It also meant that when Williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed Chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - Brokaw didn't have his back. A friend told the publication that while Brokaw - who was 'livid' about the scandal - didn't call for Williams to be punished, he 'didn't try to save him either.' Following the suspension, Williams reportedly declared to a friend: 'Chalk one up for Brokaw.' Not impressed: Brokaw, pictured in February, came 'incensed' when he heard Williams' exaggerations . The article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident, Williams couldn't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead, he suggested he might have a brain tumor. '(He said,) 'Did something happen to (my) head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head',' a source said. 'He just didn't know. We just didn't know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best (apology) we could get.' When it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident, NBC quickly learned Williams himself would be of no help. 'He was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place, slash misrepresented it, slash lied,' one insider said. Others suggested that the problem with Williams' work was because the newscaster, who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at Nightly News, had no interest in reporting on war stories or 'heavy' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors. His appearance on late-night talk shows and comedy series, such as 30 Rock, suggested that instead of getting into gritty news, he actually wanted his own talk show, Vanity Fair suggested. While some NBC employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered, others say it did not go down well with the network. 'He didn't want to leave New York,' one source said. 'Getting him to war zones was real tough... but when he did go, he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things.' In February, Williams was forced to admit that he wasn't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003  - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years. 'Overwhelmed': Sources told Vanity Fair that Williams, pictured in Iraq, did not want to report on 'hard' news and didn't enjoy politics or war stories, and lacked the experience of his predecessors . Lies: During a report in 2003, he reported how a Chinook, pictured, had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down. In fact, he was on one about 30 minutes behind . It came after he claimed on the Nightly News in January that his aircraft had been hit, causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved. Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Even though Williams learned about the uproar over his false story on Facebook, he failed to bring it up with NBC execs when he met with them the next day, suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff, former employees told Vanity Fair. Days after the false report, he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter. 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' While Williams initially believed he'd be back to work within days, he was ultimately suspended for six months, and he accepted that he had to step back, sources said. NBC Nightly News is now being anchored by Lester Holt and it is unclear if Williams will return. Questions: A number of Williams' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. But in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams said he saved two puppies. In the same Esquire interview, Williams also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years, Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Earlier this year, he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' He was later suspended over the incident. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter \u2013 even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.",

        "text": "The polls predict the Lib Dems face a bloodbath on election day, with dozens of their MPs fighting for their survival. But the metaphor became all too real for Stephen Gilbert when he was bitten by a dog while campaigning for re-election in Cornwall. He joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand. Lib Dem Stephen Gilbert posted this image online of his bloodied hand after being bitten by a dog on the campaign . Mr Gilbert is defending a majority of just 1,312 in St Austell and Newquay, and Lib Dem insiders today admitted the party is on course to lose at least 20 MPs on May 7. His run-in with the dog happened while canvassing this morning.\u00a0The animal took a lump out of his right hand as he posted a leaflet through a letterbox. He posted a photo of his injury on Twitter. It showed him wiping away the blood with his handkerchief and the message: 'Am guessing this dog had unresolved anger issues.' But undeterred by the injury, and perhaps recognising that the Tories pose a bigger threat to his survival, he planned to return to the streets this afternoon. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said he was delivering a leaflets through doors at the time. He said: 'He was out in the constituency delivering a leaflet through a letter box when the dog bit him. It is a hazard of the job and all politicians are vulnerable to it. 'Stephen has been treated at the minor injuries unit at the local hospital this morning and has been bandaged up with a few painkillers. He will be back on the campaign trail this afternoon.' Mr Gilbert joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand . A quarter of MPs have admitted to being chased or bitten by a dog while out campaigning for re-election, a study showed earlier this month. Cornwall is a major battleground for the Lib Dems, with three seats coming under heavy fire from the Tories. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes,\u00a0senior\u00a0party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the\u00a0thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.",

The Wildcats close the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals.

There are other programs with talent, though. Wisconsin has some future pros, and they came up big in the biggest game of their lives - a rematch of last year's semifinals where the Wildcats won 74-73.

'They did to us what we've been doing to other teams all season,' Calipari said. 'They executed down the stretch and we didn't.' Trailing by four and gasping for breath with their hands on their knees after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. It started with a tough, twisting shot by a future NBAer, Sam Dekker (16 points), and kept going when Nigel Hayes tipped in an air ball after the shot clock had clearly turned to '0.' No violation was called, and in a game full of shaky officiating that left both coaches screaming, it generated momentum for the Badgers and left Kentucky flat.

        "text": "The first man to serve as White House social secretary, Jeremy Bernard, is leaving after four years on the job. The White House said today that Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month held in honor of the Japanese Prime Minister, confirming rumors that Bernard, 53, would soon exit the administration. The first lady said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy,' she added. 'Jeremy will be missed, and Barack and I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.' The first lady, pictured here in November 2011 with White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard in Hawaii, said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' Obama added, 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy' The White House did not name a replacement for Bernard, who is also the first gay man to hold the position, nor did it explain why he was leaving. Michelle Obama spoke highly of his time on staff, however, saying, 'For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year.' Bernard simply stated that it's been an 'honor' to serve the Obamas and lauded the first lady for welcoming 'every guest to the White House with her signature warmth, grace and style.' 'I feel so privileged to have worked for such an extraordinary President and First Lady,' his statement read. The former California resident told the Washington Post that he planned to return to The Golden States, and he's 'really looking for some time to think about what\u2019s next and spend some quality time with Garbo, my rescue beagle.' Bernard is pictured here catching snowflakes on the Colonnade of the White House in this February 2014 photo captured by the building's official photographer. The White House today confirmed that\u00a0Bernard, 53, would depart after a state dinner next month . According to a profile of Bernard in Vogue, Bernard stumbled into politics in the early '90s while waiting tables in Los Angeles. There he met a fundraiser for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Dave Mixner, who brought him under his wing and into Clintonland. Bernard later formed a California-based political consulting firm with his ex-boyfriend, Democratic operative Rufus Gifford, that became the vehicle for Barack Obama's West Coast fundraising during his first campaign for president. Obama rewarded Bernard for his hard work with an appointment as the White House's liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities. He briefly served as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to France in 2010 before accepting the position of social secretary the following year with his boss' blessing. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as social secretary since February 2011, carefully avoiding the limelight, unlike his predecessor\u00a0Desir\u00e9e Rogers, the first African-American social secretary, who was forced out of the administration after just 13 months on the job. It was during Rogers' tenure that socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed a White House state dinner in 2009. The couple went on to start in Bravo's Real Housewives of D.C. reality TV series. No such mishaps happened during the tenure of Bernard, whose behind-the-scenes work kept the White House in shipshape during social events. His first interview since taking the job, the Vogue profile, did not hit newsstands until February of this year - his fourth anniversary as social secretary. Asked for the interview why he believes he was chosen for the job, Bernard said, 'I would imagine part of it is a trust issue. I was there from the beginning. I was a known quantity. They certainly knew that I was loyal and supportive.' This March 18 photo shows, from left to right, Jeremy Bernard, Democratic operative Karen Finney, Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Rachel Goslins, and former Obama administration officals Stephanie Cutter at the ELLE and HUGO BOSS Women in Washington Power List Dinner at The Residence of the German Ambassador. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as White House social secretary since February 2011 and has carefully avoiding the limelight for the better part of his tenure . Under Bernard's watch, the White House has moved from formal printed invitations for many events to an email system. It has also shed the tradition of seating husbands and wives away from each other at dinners. Bernard told Vogue his team had received 'some criticism' for departing from the traditional seating chart, but it done in accordance with the first lady's will. 'it does bring a comfort level,' he said, of husbands and wives being allowed to sit together. 'And I believe that was part of what Mrs. Obama wanted. 'It is still the White House, still very historic and traditional, but it doesn\u2019t have to be uncomfortable.' Speaking to the Washington Post about his impeding departure, Bernard summed up his work as making 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 'as open as possible and to grant access to as many people as possible, especially people who had never been to the house before.' 'It\u2019s easy to fall into patterns, and what Mrs. Obama has been able to do is have an attitude that keeps it fresh,' he said. At the time of the Vogue interview, which was conducted over several months, dating back to the beginning of November even though it was not published until February, Bernard claimed not to know what his next professional move would be and said he was focusing on the last two years of the Obamas' residency in the White House. 'The good thing about this job\u2014and perhaps the bad thing\u2014is that I am not able to think about the future,' he said. Bernard said that a previous White House social secretary told him 'she lost sleep toward the end because people told her she would go on to do great things next, but they never told her what.' 'She warned me that I do have to start thinking about it,' he recalled.\u00a0'I know I do; I just haven\u2019t yet. I\u2019m sort of putting my head in the sand.'",

        "text": "Jailed: Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk . A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire \u00a3401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the \u00a3400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited \u00a3500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend \u00a315,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him.

        "text": "(CNN)One year after it was perpetrated, the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in Nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend: Hundreds of teenaged girls, just finishing school, destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped, never to be seen again. \"This crime has rightly caused outrage both in Nigeria and across the world,\" the country's President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, said Tuesday in marking the anniversary. \"Today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims, their friends and families. Our thoughts and prayers, and that of the whole Nigerian nation, are with you today.\" The girls were abducted on the night of April 14-15, 2014, in the town of Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, about a two-hour drive from the border with Cameroon. The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants, who are opposed to Western education, particularly for girls. But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics. The militants stormed the school, arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards. Then they forced the girls from their dormitories, loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest. Most have never been seen since, except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle, clad in Islamic dress. They were between 16 and 18 years old. Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all. About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted. Those who did not, it is feared, may have been raped, brutalized, enslaved and forced to convert to Islam. Their parents were stricken with grief. The world was appalled. On Twitter, a hashtag began trending and spread around the world: #BringBackOurGirls. On Tuesday, Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls' education, sent a message to the kidnapped girls. \"I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers,\" she wrote. \"We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you.\" One year later, a few things have changed. Each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity. Each is now a year older. Nigeria's current president, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated in his campaign for re-election, in part, it is thought, because he failed to effectively combat Boko Haram. Buhari, the incoming president, has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group. But much remains unchanged, as well. Boko Haram still controls swathes of northeastern Nigeria. According to UNICEF, 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the Nigerian military, civilian self-defense groups, and Boko Haram. Amnesty International says women and children continue to be abducted. And it says Boko Haram continues to kill in large numbers. Beyond that, more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing.  Their families are still bereft. And Tuesday on Twitter, a hashtag was still trending: #BringBackOurGirls.",

Ashley Madison, an online dating agency, is betting on Europe's relaxed attitude to boost its investment when it lists shares on the stock market in London later this year. It's founder Noel Biderman, 43, who came up with the idea for the site in the 1990s when he worked as a sports attorney, wants to raise money from investors to fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states. Scroll down for video . Noel Biderman, 43, (pictured) who is the founder of Ashley Madison - a Canadian dating website for married people - wants to raise money from British investors to fund a launch of its services elsewhere in the world . Ashley Madison, a Canadian online dating agency\u00a0which boasts 'life is short, have an affair', is targeting British investors for stock shares because of the UK's supposed 'laissez faire' attitude to extra-marital affairs . With more than 34 million members worldwide, Ashley Madison claims to be the world's second-largest dating website. Only Match.com is bigger. Despite being happily married himself, father-of-two Mr Biderman, who was born in Canada, claims infidelity can actually save relationships and believes people 'use affairs to preserve their marriage'. He is a self-made multi-millionaire having successfully launched the company in Toronto before rolling it out in other major nations. Avid Life Media, the parent company of Ashley Madison, values itself at \u00a3669million ($1 billion) and had a reported revenue of \u00a377million ($115 million) in 2014 alone - up 45 percent from the preceding year. Mr Biderman believes the website is such a success because it gives members the 'perfect affair' - helping them cheat on their partner with like-minded people and reducing their chances of getting caught in the act. He now wants to raise up to \u00a3135million ($200 million) by listing shares for Ashley Madison in London this year, to help continue its growth worldwide. It comes five years after a lack of investor appetite caused it to pull an attempt to list in Canada. Avid Life Media has 1.2million customers in the UK and 35million worldwide but was forced to scrap a flotation in Toronto in 2010 after investors weren't convinced to buy in. Mr\u00a0Biderman came up with the idea for Ashley Madison in the 1990s when he was working as a sports attorney. He said he realised there was a space in the market for the site after watching stars arrange affairs . Mr\u00a0Biderman claims to have been happily married to his wife Amanda for 10 years and the pair have two sons . The company hopes success in London will help it fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states in late May or June. Membership is growing quickest in India, South Korea and Japan. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors to the site are greeted by a brunette woman, who is extending her finger across her lips in a shushing gesture. She is wearing what appears to be a wedding ring. Christoph Kraemer, director of international relations for Ashley Madison said: 'It is for people who are married, who are seeking an affair and want to do so in a discreet environment. 'In Europe, we have simply got a more laissez faire attitude towards a business such as ours.' Mr Kraemer also believes the website can actually help married couples, by 'igniting a spark in their marriage'. He said: 'The response we get from our members who have actually had an affair via the website is that they feel happier, invigorated and transmit that happiness, which actually reinforces and ignites a spark in their marriage and relationships.' Avid Life Media, which is backed financially by a number of anonymous investors, owns also various other similar websites including Cougarlife.com and EstablishedMen.com. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors are greeted by a brunette woman with a finger to her lips . Married father-of-two Neil Biderman, 43, (pictured) is the man behind dating website Ashley Madison . The founder of the world\u2019s largest online dating agency for extra-marital activity which boasts \u2018life is short, have an affair\u2019 is a multi-millionaire father-of-two who claims to have been happily married for 10 years. Neil Biderman, 43, the man behind dating website Ashley Madison, has made millions from his unique website which offers married partners the chance to have an affair with other spouses. However, despite his hugely successful business, Canadian-born Mr Biderman \u2013 who is often referred to as \u2018the king of infidelity\u2019 claims he has never cheated on his wife Amanda and remains happily married. The couple have two sons. Despite his loyalty claims, Mr Biderman did once reveal that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to cheat if the sexual relationship with his wife dried up. Speaking to the Evening Standard last year, he said: \u2018We\u2019re incredibly communicative about our sexual needs. \u2018But if I woke up beside my wife and it was the 200th day we hadn\u2019t been intimate with one another and it looked like nothing would change, I would cheat so fast. \u2018I would cheat long before I would get a divorce. If you have children that you love and a home that you built together and a future that you planned \u2014 why would you give that up just for sex?\u2019 Mr Biderman came up with the idea for the extra-marital dating site in the 1990s, after a career as a sports attorney apparently made him realise how much time and money his clients spent on mistresses while they were away on tour. The site has made him a self-made multi-millionaire and he claims it is worth at least \u00a3669million ($1 billion). Despite its risqu\u00e9 nature, Mr Biderman\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t appear to mind because she agrees it is a \u2018sound business idea\u2019. The pair insist the social network is just a tool and no one can force anyone to betray a spouse and even believe the dating website can actually help save marriages. M Biderman said previously: \u2018The reason people have affairs is that they want to stay married. \u2018What I get is a lot of people who come back to me and say: 'Listen, this has made me a better partner.' \u2018They were angry and taking things out on their family. The sexual frustration they were feeling, they start having the affair and all of a sudden, that stress is removed. It's very cathartic for those people. \u2018If you come home and you've had an affair earlier in the day, it might be easier not to be frustrated with your partner. The conversation could take a different directional tone and that can lead to intimacy. He also has previously said: \u2018My belief is that people use affairs to preserve their marriage.\u2019",

Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos . Covered: An image, left, shows Everest Base Camp as it usually looks in April compared to how the same place looked following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday. Survivors have recalled how they felt themselves being dragged by the wind and snow and emerged to find the camp destroyed . Before the storm: The snow-covered scenes are in start contrast to how the base camp (seen in 2013) usually looks at this time of year . Flattened: But on Saturday, an avalanche pummeled the campers at the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp, leaving it covered with snow . American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed by the avalanche where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added:\u00a0'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow. I must have been swept almost 200 meters. I lost consciousness. Wreckage: People look over the scene on Saturday after the earthquake triggered the avalanche that flattened parts of the base camp . Deadly: An image from Sunday shows a tent completely flattened by the avalanche, which left 18 people dead on Saturday . Carried to safety: Rescuers use a makeshift stretcher to carry an injured person after the massive avalanche on Saturday . Changed landscape: Another photograph shows the base camp following the huge avalanche on Saturday . Fight for survival: One survivor recalled 'a huge wall of snow' falling on him and how he had to claw his way out to survival . Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to\u00a0his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured.

The 28-year-old was diagnosed with the cancer seven months into her pregnancy, and doctors told her she could  give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy but both would require her to have a blood\u00a0transfusion. The Sydney woman refused both options due to her religious beliefs and her baby died in utero three days later. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis\u00a0after suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a\u00a0challenge\u00a0to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. The 28-year-old had pregnancy complications due to her leukemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . In a recent  article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber\u00a0Biscoe wrote:\u00a0'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' The woman was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.",

On Tuesday, SpaceX came incredibly close to landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, leaked footage reveals just how close Elon Musk's firm came to success, with a close-up view of the daring attempt shot on a GoPro camera . A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind. The video, which appeared on Reddit, reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt. A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster. Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact. \u00a0A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.'\u00a0This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon \u2014 the only supply ship capable of returning items intact \u2014 will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket.\u00a0SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning .",

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from\u00a0Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff . Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014.",

The Goldilocks principle is a scientific term for when the state of something falls within certain margins, based on the children's story The Three Bears. In the story, Goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears.

        "text": "The casket of promising basketball player Lauren Hill has been moved into the 10,000-seater arena where she made her first basket in a college game just five months ago. The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with\u00a0her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December.\u00a0The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James\u00a0posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:\" What am I doing with my life?\" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. \"How can I be a better person?\" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial . Hill's high school basketball team, the Lawrenceburg Tigers, carried her jersey and a net into the memorial . Memorabilia from Hill's basketball career including a ball, net and her jersey, were placed by the casket . The public memorial was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with Hill's casket decorated with flowers . Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's\u00a066-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 \u2014 her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs \u2014 Katy Perry's 'Roar' \u2014 was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million \u2014 matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati . The fundraising campaign will continue through the school and the foundation. A number of people have praised the teenager's courage and determination as she battled her condition.

        "text": "This year has seen a rash of massive dust storms around the world that have led to travel chaos and blocked out sunlight - but experts cannot pinpoint the reason behind the spate. This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of\u00a0Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging\u00a0sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported\u00a0RT. Earlier this month\u00a0Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm\u00a0while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agull\u00f3, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: \u2018We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.\u2019 He added: \u2018Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.\u2019 Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world\u2019s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agull\u00f3, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them.

        "text": "FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein has made a formal rotation of the World Cup between the continents one of the key elements of his manifesto and says he can see a tournament being jointly hosted by several different nations. Prince Ali, a current FIFA vice-president from Jordan, said he could envisage a World Cup being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to Euro 2020 which is being played in 13 nations. In his manifesto, which he launched on Monday, Prince Ali has also warned against any decision on expanding the World Cup from its current 32 countries, or a re-allocation of places, being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the FIFA presidency. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, a FIFA presidential candidate, wants to see the World Cup rotated between nations . Prince Ali, who aims to replace  Sepp Blatter (right), warned against expanding the World Cup from 32 teams . Prince Ali is standing for FIFA president alongside former Portugal and Real Madrid player Luis Figo . He is standing against current president Sepp Blatter, Michael van Praag from Holland and former Portugal international Luis Figo. In terms of World Cup rotation, Prince Ali said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament. 'The principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids,' he said. 'But we have to be open-minded. I think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the World Cup. Look at Europe in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the World Cup - it's in the past now but potentially the Gulf could have had a World Cup due to its close proximity.' FIFA has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of World Cup places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on May 29. Prince Ali said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made. He added: 'I am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of FIFA and possibly of sport in the world. 'We need to speak to all the stakeholders, including the sponsors. People are making promises to enlarge the World Cup but in 2022 they are making the World Cup shorter in terms of time frame. We cannot end up with a situation where mistakes are made again.' Prince Ali has also promised greater transparency, including making public the salary of the FIFA president and executive committee members. He also believes that the minutes of FIFA executive committee meetings should be made public. He also wants an investigation into how the US television rights for the 2026 World Cup were awarded to Fox without a tender process or any discussion with the FIFA executive committee. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said FIFA 'did what it had to do' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the Qatar World Cup was moved to the winter. Prince Ali, who insists there is a real appetite for change among FIFA associations, said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost. 'Unfortunately I was not made aware of it and I have been trying to find out what is going on,' he said. Michael van Praag (right), from Holland, is the remaining presidential candidate . 'Something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it. 'It needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world. 'We are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time.'",

I jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration. And where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious Grenada? The island is known for its zesty spices and self-sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk. Heading west: Rosemary spent a week on Grenada, where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available . Meat and fish are plentiful and, because the soil is very fertile, the vegetables, fruit and salads are the glossiest you'll ever see. Grenada's seasons are similar to our own, which means cauliflower, broccoli and pumpkins in spring. Exotic fruit - mangoes, star fruit, passion fruit, melon and skin-up, which is like a lychee \u2014 are the stars of the summer. Autumn heralds guavas, sweetsop (sugar apples) and soursop (similar to pawpaw), and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple, which is a Caribbean version of a peach. Sumptuous sands: Grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of Grand Anse . I am staying in the southwest of the island at Mount Cinnamon on Grand Anse Beach, near the charming town of St George. It offers well-equipped self-catering villas, each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay. You can cook your own supper, but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist. Beach bars abound. I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night. People come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures. The restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine. I order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate. Come dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes . The next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips. If you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island. In a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory. Here, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious! The food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour. My favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea. A place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resort . No tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century. Rum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it. Belmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish. Even the governor grows her own vegetables. Her Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island. She received an OBE from the Queen for the food business started by her mother. Her extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables, fruit and spices \u2014 a dream to any aspiring cook.

        "text": "The family of one ANZAC\u00a0veteran\u00a0were thrilled to receive news from a stranger this week that their relative's war medal had been unearthed in an east Melbourne Park. Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when\u00a0he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably\u00a0not his either. Instead, it records the\u00a0date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny'\u00a0Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return\u00a0the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'",

        "text": "A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat\u2019s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning \u2018strange wing\u2019, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Su\u00e1rez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world\u2019s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning \"strange wing\" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don\u2019t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how \u00a0the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: \u2018As for gliding, if Yi qi\u2019s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. \u2018But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body \u2014 if the bulk of the animal\u2019s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. \u2018That is clearly the case in the authors\u2019 reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. \u2018Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. \u2018And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.\u2019",
        "generated": "A new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered in China. Palaeontologists say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago and may have been able to glide or even fly through the air. The dinosaur had unusual bristle-like feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat's wing.In the same week, researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China, and has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. The strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them confused palaeontologists.Yi qi is not like any other bird or dinosaur that has a wing of the same kind. It lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead, it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground, potentially like modern flying squirrels. The discovery of Yi qi has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air, and has been referred to as 'the most unexpected discovery' by one of the world's leading palaeontologists.",

The 33-year-old royal\u2019s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week.

A source, whose children were born at the hospital\u2019s exclusive Lindo Wing, told Daily Telegraph reporter Gordon Rayner: \u2018The doctors don\u2019t normally wait for more than a week. \u2018They will probably already have been in touch with Kate, and talked about which day which suit her best to go in and be induced if the baby doesn\u2019t arrive in the next couple of days.\u2019 A Kensington Palace source said last week: 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date.' \u00a0Prince George was reportedly born three days late when he arrived at the hospital in July 2013. The joint favourite dates for the royal baby to be born are tomorrow and Tuesday at 6/1 - with Wednesday priced at 7/1 and Thursday 8/1, according to MailOnline's official betting partner Coral.

The idea is the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects water in the sea and rivers. When Kate gave birth  on July 22, 2013, it was the day of a new full moon. Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Sky News today: \u2018I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.\u2019 Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted.

Both Los Blancos stars were substituted as Carlo Ancelotti's side struggled to overcome a spirited Malaga, who had chances to snatch a draw. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty but provided goals for Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez, before adding the third himself, as Madrid kept within touching distance of league leaders Barcelona. Sergio Ramos celebrates scoring for Real Madrid in the 24th-minute against Malaga . Real Madrid captain Ramos celebrates with his team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . James Rodriguez made it 2-0 for Real Madrid in the 69th-minute after Ronaldo had missed a penalty . Malaga then pulled one back but Ronaldo look delighted after making up for his earlier miss to make it 3-1 . Real Madrid: Casillas, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Arbeloa (Carvajal 76'), Kroos, Rodriguez, Modric (Illarramendi 60'), Isco, Ronaldo, Bale (Hernandez 5') Subs not used: Navas, Silva, Fernandez, Jese . Booked: Arbeloa, Kroos . Goals: Ramos 24' Rodriguez 69' Ronaldo 90' Malaga: Kameni, Angeleri, Roseles, Boka, Sanchez, Amrabat, Garcia, Recio (Damian Tissone 75'), Castillejo (Horta 81'), Darder (Duda 87), Juanmi . Subs not used: Guerra, Ochoa, Torres, Filipenko . Booked: Sanchez, Damian Tissone . Goals: Juanmi 71' After just four minutes, Bale's game was over. The Welshman tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch, which might imply internal muscle damage. Given that Karim Benzema was injured after a brutal Champions League encounter with City rivals Atletico Madrid in midweek, Bale's injury took the famous \"BBC\" strikeforce just down to C. That's the grade you'd give it too, in 2015, when compared to the performances of Barcelona's trio. Isco came in for Benzema, with the Frenchman's injury solving a problem that was brewing at Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti having to choose between the former Malaga man, and James Rodriguez. The latter was chosen over the former to face Atletico, leading to stories of angst on Isco's part, but the issue was resolved by Benzema's timely absence. Modric, meanwhile, was taken out by a Recio challenge in the second half. It wasn't too fierce a tackle, but the Croatian took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for Wednesday's second leg against Atletico. Malaga, having beaten Barcelona at Camp Nou earlier this season, and drawn with champions Atletico Madrid last week, are no La Liga whipping boys and they came to the Santiago Bernabeu with the belief they could win. Nordin Amrabat, on loan from Galatasaray, charged forward battling with Pepe, escaped the Real Madrid defender and crossed for Juanmi, but the forward couldn't connect and the chance was gone. The Dutchman stung Iker Casillas' fingertips with a strike from distance, the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner. Carlos Idriss Kameni was forced into a similar save at the other end, spectacularly flicking a header from Bale's replacement, Javier Hernandez, over the bar. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu . The Welsh forward was forced to go off to be replaced in the early stages of proceedings . Ramos tucks the ball in to open the scoring for Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . The defender slides on his knees in front of the Real Madrid fans after netting . Real Madrid broke the deadlock in controversial fashion, when Ronaldo fired in a free kick from the left and Ramos rammed home from close range. The defender seemed fractionally offside, but despite Kameni's cries, the goal was allowed to stand. The Cameroonian goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, making a fine save down to his right from a James volley. With the most expensive player in the world off the pitch, the second most expensive was having fun. Ronaldo pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel-nutmeg on Marcos Angeleri. In the following minute Ramos had the ball in the net again, nodding home a Toni Kroos free-kick, but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out. Malaga flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity, which Sergi Darder blazed over the bar when he should have found the net. Juanmi's cross was half-cleared by Marcelo and Darder pounced, but lacked balance and spooned his strike off-target from eight yards. Amrabat, flying down the right early in the second half, tried to find Juanmi with a low cross, but it flew past the forward and Casillas gathered it. Ronaldo had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond Malaga when James was taken down in the box by Samu Castillejo, but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright.

But Real Madrid didn't have long to wait for their second, with James scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later. He played two one-twos on the edge of the box with Isco and Ronaldo, before lashing the ball into Kameni's top right corner. Game over? Not quite. Malaga were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet, with Roberto Rosales whipping the ball in from the right for Juanmi to head home. Amrabat had a chance to run through after a Marcelo mis-step - this was a rare poor performance for the Brazilian - but Kroos resorted to a blatant kick to stop him. The German went into the book, with the foul a symbol of how Madrid were struggling to prevent the Andalusian side from getting forward on the break. Ronaldo saw his second-half penalty hit the post after Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni had gone the right way . Real Madrid forward Ronaldo looks frustrated after missing a penalty during the second half . But Rodriguez soon doubled Real Madrid's lead just a couple of minutes after Ronaldo had missed the penalty . Ronaldo celebrates after securing the 3-1 victory late on after Malaga had pulled one back . Ronaldo's evening was saved on a personal level at the end, with Hernandez selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post. His celebration was excessive, considering Madrid had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish, but that's what happens when you have to keep up with the Joneses. Or in this case, the Messis. The Argentine had scored for Barcelona earlier, so Ronaldo would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate Messi's effort, grabbing his 39th goal of the season in La Liga, and his 50th in all competitions. Ronaldo became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, an incredible statistic, but Ancelotti's mind will now turn to Wednesday night and another incredible statistic. He has faced Atletico Madrid seven times so far this season and not won a single game. Will he be forced to try it without Modric and Bale in the eighth?",

        "text": "Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season and on Saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to Chelsea\u2019s imminent title victory. He is now the player you look to in a crisis. He is the man who has been eking out wins when the team hasn\u2019t been at its best. He did it last week at Queens Park Rangers, winning the ball from the goalkeeper\u2019s kick and driving into the box to set up Cesc Fabregas, and he did it on Saturday with his finish. He\u2019s dragging them over the line at the minute. You wondered when Jose Mourinho came in whether Hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him. And he would have taken the hint when he saw Juan Mata moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players. Eden Hazard fires past David De Gea following a storming run from the Belgian star into the box . Hazard celebrates in front of the Stamford Bridge faithful following his 38th minute strike . The Chelsea forward's first-half strike proved crucial as the Blues eked out a 1-0 victory . He perhaps looked at that and responded. You will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back \u2014 but not today, not against the best teams. Then he is required to do the requisite defensive work. And he does now. But the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing \u2014 and that was evident again on Saturday. He\u2019s now on 17 goals for the season. He\u2019s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals. He is the danger man, he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team. He\u2019s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he\u2019s creeping ever closer. What he will need to reach that level is for Chelsea to make a Champions League final and for him to be decisive. Hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the United goal as Ander Herrera tries to snuff out the danger . He is improving every season, which is a good sign, and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good. Chelsea will win the league now. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time. It\u2019s about surviving the difficult periods \u2014 and Chelsea haven\u2019t lost games when they\u2019ve struggled in the same way that Manchester City or Manchester United did. Now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and Mourinho would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fabregas a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate. As for United, for all their dominance in possession, they lacked enough clear-cut chances. In fact they needed something like the magic of Oscar\u2019s back-heel and Hazard\u2019s finish. Louis van Gaal will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch. Wayne Rooney takes on\u00a0Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Hazard at Stamford Bridge . With Wayne Rooney not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries, it did neuter them somewhat. I thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position \u2014 his passing and play was excellent. But he\u2019s been the thrust of the team in recent times. Maybe two years ago Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie could have provided that, but at the moment United need Rooney to give them that impetus in the really difficult games. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation. It\u2019s been a bumpy ride and they wouldn\u2019t have expected another change of manager, but at least, two years on, it looks as though they are now in that place. Jose Mourinho may look to give key players such as Fabregas (right) a rest in the coming weeks .",

Chelsea captain John Terry is on course to appear in all 38 Premier League matches for his side this season . The Blues captain has made an appearance in all 33 Premier League games for Chelsea so far this season . It's an impressive tally for the 34-year-old, who will no doubt be hoping he can mark another memorable season with a personal best of having featured in all 38 Premier League games come the end of the season. If Terry manages to make appearances in all of Chelsea's remaining fixtures against Leicester, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, West Brom and Sunderland, he will beat the 37 domestic appearances he made during his side's last title-winning season in 2009-10. And he made 36 in 2004-05 and again the following season - his other two Premier League title triumphs. During his time as Blues boss, Rafa Benitez (left) believed Terry couldn't play two games in a week . Terry had to settle for a place on the bench under Benitez and made just 14 Premier League appearances . Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Sunday, manager Jose Mourinho said: 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made fantastic performances with me in six years but for me this was the best I have seen from him. 'It was the best JT has ever played. His defensive performance was absolutely amazing.' This season, Terry has played 2,970 minutes, scoring three goals along the way as Chelsea sit at the Premier League's summit, 10 points clear of second-placed Manchester City having already collected the Capital One Cup in March.

He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him \u2013 to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday \u2013 where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump\u2019s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at\u00a0Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump \u2013 In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "text": "An Israeli geologist claims he has \u2018confirmed\u2019 the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary \u2013 a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother \u2013 to the long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) \u2013 a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead \u2013 to the long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019 and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron\u2019s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, \u2018Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron\u2019s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, \u2018James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus\u2019. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the \u2018crust\u2019 of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries \u2013 15 of which were from unrelated tombs \u2013 and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of \u2018Rendzina\u2019 soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the \u2018holy\u2019 location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, \u2018Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: \u2018This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 Dr Shumron told The New York Times: \u2018I think I\u2019ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.\u2019 The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: \u2018 The evidence is beyond what I expected.\u2019 The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv.",

        "text": "Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to \u2018lead the UK\u2019 as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of \u00a39,000 a year to \u00a36,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election .

The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP\u2019s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called \u2018modest\u2019 spending increases funded by yet more borrowing \u2013 but which in fact total \u00a3180billion over five years. Scotland\u2019s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a \u2018progressive alliance\u2019 for people \u2018right across the UK\u2019. \u2018There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,\u2019 she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. Today\u2019s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party\u2019s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a \u2018strong team\u2019 of SNP MPs in Westminster would help \u2018rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected\u2019. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year\u2019s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. \u2018We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland\u2019s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn\u2019t leave the UK but lead the UK,\u2019 she said. \u2018So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland\u2019s voice shouldn\u2019t be heard or that Scotland\u2019s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.\u2019 However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today\u2019s launch over her plans for \u2018full fiscal autonomy\u2019 or effective \u2018home rule\u2019, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a \u2018fiscally autonomous\u2019 Scotland would have a \u00a37.6billion black hole in its finances.",

The SNP is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, with polls suggesting it could win up to 50 seats and hold the balance of power at Westminster.

        "text": "Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case\u00a0brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very \u2013 or morbidly \u2013 obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity \u2013 classified as a BMI of more than 40 \u2013 could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making \"stereotypical assumptions\" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.",

        "text": "A high-level ministerial briefing exclusively obtained by Daily Mail Australia reveals an 'unprecedented' number of Australians could face the death penalty in China for drug smuggling. The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC.\u00a0Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline. A spokesman for Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said Australia should lead efforts against the death penalty, 'in particular working with the United Nations'.

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal\u2019s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal\u2019s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley\u2019s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield\u2019s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes\u2019 aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal\u2019s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean\u2019s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley\u2019s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems . Olivier Giroud holds the ball up, but couldn't add to his six-game goalscoring run at Turf Moor .",

The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, shows off her toned abs in the new campaign shoot . Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself . Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises there\u2019s 'a little something for everyone'. 'Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it,' she explained. 'I\u2019m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress, so my designs embody that contrast. 'I\u2019m always about wearing what looks and feels good to you, not about following trends. So I try to create clothing that fits that, allowing the person wearing it to make it their own however it fits their own personal style.' Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises the range, pictured, offers 'a little something for everyone' Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. 'I\u2019ve always loved that London street style, but I\u2019ve started to fuse it with a more American style the more time I\u2019ve spent here,' she said. 'But UK or US, I\u2019ve always been a sneakerhead. Adidas has always been a staple in my closet, so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them, I\u2019m just grateful they wanted to work with me!'. Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita, pictured judging on The Voice, explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career . As well as conquering the fashion world, the humble star has been busy making music, starring in Fifty Shades Of Grey and spending time with her beau, Ricky Hilfiger. So does she ever have a day off and what does she get up to? 'Whenever I have a day off, I spend the day in my bed, watching movies, in my pyjamas, eating takeaway,' she revealed. 'I guess it\u2019s probably fortunate that I don\u2019t have too many days off, but I always like to take full advantage of any down time I can get.' Thanks to her countless projects and array of starry friends, it seems that The Voice coach is taking over the world. \u00a0'Aw, thank you!,' she replied. 'It\u2019s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. 'I\u2019m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world, so I\u2019d love to continue down that path. But music has always and will always be my main love and passion. 'In five years' time, hopefully I will still be creating music and being able to live my dreams surrounded with the people I love. I\u2019m so grateful for the opportunities I\u2019ve had so far, I\u2019m excited to see what the future will hold.'

The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider is widely regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made. But it is best known for that infamous scene in the 1986 teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The car, in classic Ferrari red, was the pride and joy of the father of Ferris Bueller's best friend Cameron in the movie.\u00a0That was until the friends take the model out for a spin which results in the convertible accidentally smashing through its glass showroom doors into the ravine below. A stunning Ferrari - which is almost identical to the model driven in cult eighties classic film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is up for auction . The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (pictured) is regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made . But its most famous moment came it was used as the car for the 1986 teen comedy Ferris Bueller, starring Matthew Broderick . In the movie, Ferris took best friend Cameron's dad's red model out without permission but the car eventually trashed . You killed the car: In one of the film world's best-known scenes, the beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below after Cameron accidentally\u00a0knocks it off the jack . This car, however, is in significantly better condition and has recently undergone a full restoration by Ferrari in Maranello. One of just 16 in existence, it has a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 280bhp. It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph. It will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around \u00a38 million. The Ferrari, featuring the distinctive logo on the steering wheel, will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around \u00a38 million .

The convertible, which features luxury tan leather seats, is one of just 16 in existence and features a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 280bhp . It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph and in the auction catalogue, RM Sotheby's called it 'the most celebrated open-air Ferrari ever made' and 'an automobile with few peers' But it is expected to sell for significantly more after a model previously owned by the French actor Alain Delon and requiring a full restoration sold for \u00a312.5 million earlier this year. Peter Wallman, car specialist at RM Sotheby's, said: 'Perhaps the most beautiful convertible car ever made, and featuring the powerful Colombo designed 3.0-litre V12 engine, this spacious and versatile two-seat sports car with race car performance is the ultimate road going Ferrari of all time.' The car's ability to be driven at high speed on the track as well as comfortably across continents boosted appeal to a number of high profile customers. Hollywood star James Coburn owned one - with Chris Evans buying it in 2008 for a then world record \u00a35.6 million. The Delon car sold for more than twice this figure seven years later. This model, known as chassis 2505 GT, was originally bought by an Italian driver before the ownership was passed to a Swiss person.\u00a0It was later owned by a Brit and is currently back in Italian ownership .

In the auction catalogue, RM Sotheby's called it 'the most celebrated open-air Ferrari ever made' and 'an automobile with few peers'. It added: 'Ownership of such an automobile, both now and when new, is something that almost every Ferrari enthusiast aspires to yet something that few can attain. 'It is the epitome of la dolce vita in the automotive world, as it combines timeless style with incredible performance, and it is an automobile equally capable of pleasing its owner on the open road, the race track, or both in a single day.

        "text": "A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'",

The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister\u2019s \u00a3142,500 pay packet \u2013 and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices. A further 11 dentists were paid between \u00a3400,000 and \u00a3500,000 and a total of 177 received more than \u00a3200,000. More than 1,600 pocketed \u00a3100,000-\u00a3200,000.

Lucrative: Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts, as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were \u2018scandalous\u2019 and \u2018unacceptable\u2019. Under freedom of information laws, the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13, the latest figures available, five practitioners were paid more than \u00a3500,000. They shared a total of about \u00a33.4million \u2013 an average of \u00a3690,000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned \u00a3400,000 to \u00a3499,999 from the NHS, 30 received \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3399,999, 131 pocketed \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3299,999 and 1,617 received \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3199,999. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the rates of pay were \u2018exorbitant\u2019. Yesterday's Daily Mail . She added: \u2018Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [and] patients waiting for hours in A&E \u2026 when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure, this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.\u2019 It follows revelations in Thursday\u2019s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday, the Mail also exposed a \u00a32,700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals \u2013 treble the cost to the health service \u2013 raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern\u2019s Roger Goss said: \u2018This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists\u2019 pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. \u2018There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands, suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.\u2019 Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance, which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research, said the salaries show a \u2018shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride\u2019. He added: \u2018It is outrageous that these telephone-number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them \u2026 Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients, not on bumper pay packets.\u2019 The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year, rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday's Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands, from a simple check-up earning the dentist \u00a325, to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns, for roughly \u00a3300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds, and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts.

        "text": "Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on \u00a330billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra \u00a326billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The\u00a0Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly \u00a33 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was \u00a387.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from \u00a398.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of \u00a390.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than \u00a360 billion from \u00a3153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of \u00a31.48 trillion is more than \u00a3500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of \u00a3956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the \u00a35 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the \u00a310 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around \u00a330 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at \u00a326billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed \u00a3200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left \u00a3350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a \u00a3140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add \u00a36billion to Britain's interest bill, worth \u00a3350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

        "text": "Marathon season is in full swing with the London Marathon set to take place a week on Sunday. The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for \u00a3130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out \u00a3130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget \u00a319.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of \u00a319.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, \u00a3130:\u00a0Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene\u00a0and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the\u00a0Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At \u00a3130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of \u00a3130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, \u00a319.99:\u00a0The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for \u00a314.99 in 2013. Aldi's \u00a319.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty.\u00a0But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas:\u00a0The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the\u00a0Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At \u00a319.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the \u00a3130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.",
        "generated": "It is marathon season, with the London Marathon being held next week. Many runners will be inspired to take up running during this time. As the weather gets warmer and lighter, it is the ideal time to get in shape. There are many budget options available for runners, including trainers from Aldi. The most expensive option is the Adidas Ultra Boost, which costs \u00a3130. In contrast, Aldi has a premium running range with shoes available for \u00a319.99, while stocks last. Lucy Waterlow tested both pairs of shoes and found the Aldi pair to be adequate but not as comfortable as the Adidas pair. The Adidas shoes provided a comfortable and springy feel, while the Aldi shoes felt bulkier and less comfortable. Overall, Lucy recommended going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe that perfectly suits your foot type, especially if you plan to continue running regularly.",

        "text": "An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory, an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic: Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm. Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death . He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. 'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. 'His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. 'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse.' Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest: 'He said, \"Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall.\" I remember saying, \"Why, what happened?\" He said, \"He has fallen from a ladder.\" 'I asked if he was OK and he said he didn't know as he wasn't conscious. He said, \"You need to get here as soon as you can mum.\" I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. 'I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him.' Workplace: Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights. 'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence.' Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT.' He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking \"danger high voltage\". I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. 'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. 'That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. 'I'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.' The inquest continues.",

        "text": "(CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.",

The couple, who does not wish to be identified, hired attorney Cathy Hale to sue James Evans the owner of Premiere Photos for allegedly providing a photo booth that printed, 'Poor N***** Party' on the bottom of the pictures. The couple wasn't alerted of the photos until many months after the celebration when the bride's sister told the family about the racist incident at the photo booth the couple rented for the party. Scroll down for video . Racial slur: This racial slur was allegedly printed by Premiere Photos at the bottom of some of the photographs at their wedding event in 2012 . Denies allegations: James Evans who runs Premiere Photo allegedly didn't apologize for the racial slur and told the couple to 'sue' him . Attorney Cathy Hale who is representing the couple said that the sister of the bride \u00a0waited to tell her about what happened until after the wedding because she didn't want to ruin her special day or upset her. 'She made the wise decision not to tell her and spoil that specific day,' Hale told Click2Houston. Hale says that when the husband heard about the photos at the wedding he was horrified and called James Evans of Premiere Photo. The groom claims Evans \u00a0didn't even apologize. 'Sue me,' James Evan's reportedly replied. Hale told Click2Houston that her clients didn't want to file a lawsuit but they finally decided to press charges after Evans 'did nothing' about the racist comments. The couple is suing the company under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices act claiming that Premiere Photo practiced 'negligence and breach on contract.' When Eyewitness News reached out to Evans and his attorney, Christine Kirchner, they declined an on-camera interview but gave the same responses they gave in civil court. Venue: The couple had their wedding party at beautiful Bell Tower in northwest Houston, Texas . Evans has denied all allegations and claimed that at a party of 100 people, there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption. Evans also said the married couple gave 'no sign of any mental anguish.' Hale disagrees and says her clients want an apology at the very least. Mediation is scheduled for tomorrow morning but if the parties don't reach an agreement then the case is set for trial in July.

Hart, who passed an impressive milestone of his own by representing his country for the 50th time on Tuesday night, said after the 1-1 draw with Italy that Buffon was an inspiration. Speaking to FA TV, Hart said: 'I\u2019m still learning my game and I\u2019m still watching the likes of Buffon and the way he goes about his business at 37 years old. England and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has lavished praise on fellow goalkeeper\u00a0Gianluigi Buffon . Hart has labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' 'I\u2019ve got a lot more learning to do and I want to do it in this team. '[Buffon\u2019s caps total] is a long way off, but it\u2019s definitely a night to celebrate a terrific goalkeeper and a legend of the game, someone I personally look up to and it\u2019s inspirational to see.'

        "text": "The stylist behind singer Rita Ora's unique, over-the-top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart-topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy. Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: \"I think it's time.\" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I\u2019m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'",

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground.

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere. Members of the Liu and Ramos families are greeted by New York Mets' Matt Harvey, left, David Wright, fourth from left, and Curtis Granderson, right, after throwing out the ceremonial first pitch . Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half. Stuart Armstrong is brought down by\u00a0Partick Thistle's James Craigen leading to a penalty . Referee Willie Collum shows\u00a0Craigen a read card for his 'last man' challenge on Armstrong . Celtic striker Kris Commons steps up to convert the penalty to give his side a 1-0 lead before the break . Commons (right) races away to celebrates his 45th minute penalty strike . Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match . The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan. Johansen came close at the other end with a chip which Fox tipped over the bar, after the Norwegian had weaved his way through the Jags defence.",

        "text": "Kell Brook could have had the blockbuster fight he craves against Amir Khan instead of treading water against Frankie Gavin, if only his promoter had minded his words. Now that Battle of Britain \u2013 potentially at Wembley Stadium \u2013 may never take place. So says Khan's father Shah as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised Chris Algieri as his opponent in New York on the same night when Brook will be defending his world welterweight title against Gavin at London's O2 Arena on May 20 . Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) stands behind Kell Brook (left) and Frankie Gavin at the O2 Arena . Amir Khan celebrates his victory over Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas last year . Shah Khan, who also supervises affairs, says: 'Kell could have had his chance against Amir right now if Eddie Hearn had toned it down. But instead of being patient he's been so disrespectful. 'If he carries on like that the Brook fight will not take place. He keeps shouting about how much the fight is worth but I don't care about the money. For Amir it's more about the big fights and his status in boxing. 'Amir's told Kell he will be happy to box him in the next year but Eddie's jeopardising that. He carries on calling us out and insulting us. Any more of that and it will be all over. 'Kell has said plenty, too. But we don't think this is his fault. He seems a good lad. It's Eddie putting the words in his mouth.' Initially, Hearn's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp. Khan Snr says: 'Eddie will talk reasonably in the negotiating room. Pleasant with us. But as soon as he gets outside he starts with the nonsense.' Hearn (centre) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between Brook and Gavin . Khan (right) poses for a photo alongside father Shah (centre) and brother Haroon in Sheffield in 2013 . The Khans see a telling parable with the way Junior Witter's critical harassment of Ricky Hatton offended the Hitman. 'Ricky became annoyed and it was hard to blame him,' says Shah. 'It was a fight he would have been happy to take but when the words became unpleasant he walked away for good. 'And what's happened to Witter after that? Virtually nothing. Now he's more less forgotten. I can see the same happening to Kell. 'Yet Brook is a fight Amir would have been more than happy to have. We feel it's a fairly comfortable fight for us. Kell has done OK but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of Amir's elite level he will be found out. 'Eddie needs to calm down.' If what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality, it is over to you Mr Hearn. Eddie, a fellow columnist here at Sportsmail, has pushed through a number of matches with his outspoken pubic challenges. But last week he drew a frosty response from Carl Frampton and his legendary promoter Barry McGuigan when he brandished at them a cheque for \u00a31.5million for the Belfast Jackal to meet his man Scott Quigg in a world super-bantamweight title unification fight. Brook (left) and Gavin (right) go face to face as promoter Hearn looks on in the background . Hearn displays the cheque for \u00a31.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Khan has taken flak for lining up Algieri for his next fight, after the New Yorker was decked six times en route to an embarrassing, wipe-out defeat by Manny Pacquaio. But Algieiri did defeat the previously feared Russian puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to win the world lightweight title, which he still holds. And Khan says: 'Gavin hasn't done anything to compare with that. Sadly Frankie's recent performances against comparatively weak opposition have been anything but convincing. Good luck to him getting the pay-night but he's done nothing to justify this world title shot.' Khan jumped the gun in announcing Algieri and the May 20 date at the Barclays Center in New York, since his advisor Al Haymon was still finalising the deal. Chris Algieri (left) takes on Manny Pacquiao in a WBO welterweight title bout in Macau last year . But all seems to be in place now and the official statement should come this week. Khan was criticised, also, for allegedly declining the IBF offer of a final eliminator against Tim Bradley for Brook's belt. Khan Snr says: 'We couldn't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which Brook is so desperate to have.' His son was also accused of being less than truthful for saying he knew nothing about the offer. But there are suggestions that the secretive Haymon dismissed the IBF offer out of hand, without informing Khan. Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February . Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions \u2013 Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' \u2013 to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US. Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Andre Ward (left) poses with his many title belts after defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November 2013 . Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement \u2013 a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez. Step into Oakland's Oracle Arena, Paul Smith. Good luck to him, in every sense of the phrase.

        "text": "Julie Walter, 49, who has been jailed for two and a half years after posing as trusted officials to dupe elderly residents in sheltered housing out of money . A woman has been branded a 'menace to the community' after she posed as both a council warden and a church official to bluff her way into sheltered housing complexes to steal from vulnerable residents. Julie Walters, 49, has been jailed for two and a half years after she pretended to be a trusted official to dupe elderly victims out of cash. She was caught by police after she was spotted on CCTV loitering in the communal hall of a retirement property near to the Old Trafford football ground in Manchester before an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman were fleeced in two separate attacks. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters of Withington, Manchester, hanging around outside the complex after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester\u2019s Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard how the first victim, a man aged 81, was targeted at about midday on February 25 this year when he was walking back to his sheltered accommodation. He saw Walters get out of a taxi and she asked him for money, claiming she needed to pay the taxi and then go into town. Mistakenly thinking she was one of the wardens, he gave her about \u00a330 in cash. The next day she returned to the man\u2019s address, claiming she worked there, and needed to check his bathroom. After tricking her way inside, she stole his wallet and \u00a3100 in cash. Walters struck again on March 2 at the home of an 80-year-old man who lives at another retirement home. She falsely claimed she was from the church which convinced the man to let her inside. Walters then rifled through the kitchen, stealing his wallet containing between \u00a350 to \u00a360 in cash. Later that day and at the same retirement home, Walters targeted the home of an 81-year-old woman, claiming she was from 'the council' and needed to use the toilet. Once inside, she stole a \u00a35 note from the woman\u2019s handbag but was caught red-handed. When confronted she simply put the note on the coffee table and left. Walters was identified on the CCTV footage by a beat police officer and she was arrested on March 4. Investigations showed she had booked taxis to drop her off and then pick her up at times and locations matching those of the three burglaries. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters hanging around outside a complex, where she targeted two residents, after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester\u2019s Minshull Street Crown Court . After the case Detective Sergeant Rachel Smith of Greater Manchester Police said: \u201cWalters is devoid of conscience and scruples. \u201cShe is also extremely manipulative, not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court. \u201cIn fact, in this case, one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red-handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that, combined with the CCTV and mobile phone evidence we found, created an overwhelming case against Walters. \u201cI cannot overstate what a menace to the community Walters is but thanks to this excellent investigation, she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars. \u201cI would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age. 'By doing so, they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache.\u201d",

'We would like it to be a unique competition that's played, especially a semi-final or final and don't want it to be conflicting with other competitions. It's a very big game (at Chelsea). It's a surprise to me.' Wenger admits a United win at Chelsea could open up the title race again. 'Mathematically yes,' he said. 'But we have to keep winning.' Klopp confirmed on Wednesday his intention to leave Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for England with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Wenger hit out at the TV scheduling as Manchester United's trip to Chelsea clashes with the semi-final . Wenger has branded the 'circus' around Jurgen Klopp's resignation as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund. Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, they have the ability to keep their best players. They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.'

Wojciech Szczesny will start in the tie, and was also put through his paces during Arsenal's training session. The Gunners boss says his team have learned from last season, when they fell behind at this stage against Wigan and needed penalties to beat the Championship side. 'It's my 10th semi-final and that means we know how to prepare but it's always tricky,' he added. 'We learned from Wigan last year. It's always a special occasion to share with our fans. We want them to go home happy.' Wenger confirmed that second-choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny will start at Wembley on Saturday .

Tomasz Lazar spent hours photographing and interviewing adults who were ripped from their homes as children in the 1940s and forced to live thousands of miles away in Siberia. \"For me those faces are like maps,\" Lazar said. \"The more you look at them, the more you are discovering.\" Soviet authorities invaded Poland during World War II and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. Some were sent to prison camps in the frozen wilderness of central Russia. Many were children. In effect, Moscow stole much of an entire generation of young Poles, a handful of whom Lazar has located seven decades later. During Lazar's interviews, many of the survivors broke down in tears. \"It was very traumatic for them,\" he said. \"Some lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters -- killed by the Soviets.\" Lazar remembers hearing 84-year-old Boguslaw Dokurno recall his grandfather's dying wish. Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite. Another exile, Sofia Bocian, told Lazar how her brother escaped their prison camp, leaving her with the horrifying experience of being interrogated by Soviet secret police. Lazar began his professional photography career in 2006 after fully realizing the medium's storytelling power. \"For me when you're doing photography -- whether it's conventional journalism or other types -- you want to share something with people,\" he said. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Lazar said the interviews surprised him. Despite his subjects' traumatic experiences, \"they welcomed me with open arms,\" he recalled. \"They really wanted to share their stories.\" Fearing for their safety, they couldn't tell their stories publicly until the fall of the Soviet Union. Now that they're in their 80s, time is running out for them to document their struggles. Look at Lazar's images. The faces fill each frame. Each portrait is unique. Before taking each photo, he waited \"for the moment when they really started going inside themselves,\" he said. \"Those people are really strong in their souls.\" Their stories should be documented for history, he said, to remind future generations \"not to make the same mistakes.\" Tomasz Lazar is a Polish photographer.

The number of deaths every year in Britain \u2013 which have been falling for the past 40 years \u2013 will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Loss of baby boomers: The number of UK deaths per will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past ten years . The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 Expensive end: A \u2018simple\u2019 funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of \u00a33,590, an old age think tank has found . It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: \u2018More than half of UK households have less than \u00a33,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. \u2018We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.\u2019 The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A \u2018simple\u2019 funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of \u00a33,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost \u00a32,000 more. An average \u2018full works\u2019 funeral now costs \u00a35,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from \u00a3102 to \u00a3160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.",

Pension firms said Britons remained baffled about how the radical changes worked, with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications. Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. And yesterday, the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money. Scroll down for video . Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings \u2013 unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes.

The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone.

The clash occurred Wednesday night at the border in southwestern Saudi Arabia's Asir region, when militants in a mountainous area on the Yemeni side fired on Saudi border troops, prompting them to return fire, SPA reported. Besides the slain border guard -- identified as Cpl. Salman Ali Yahya al-Maliki -- 10 others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the Saudi media outlet said. On Thursday, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, a neutral security official and two Houthi commanders in Aden told CNN. The palace had been where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. According to the security official, Houthis now control most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. Yemeni special forces, considered pro-Houthi and loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, arrived in Aden on Thursday in an attempt \"to secure the city,\" a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation told CNN. \"I can now confirm that it is not Saudi special forces who have landed but Yemeni special forces loyal to Saleh who landed by small boat. They are few in number and have made their way to the old parliament building,\" the intelligence official said. U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The Navy on Wednesday came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a \"vessel of interest\" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Marie Claire Feghali, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman in Sanaa, described events in Aden as \"extremely fluid and very, very complicated.\" \"Hospitals are still struggling, running out of supplies. So are we,\" she said. \"We cannot move much in Aden due to the intense fighting and chaos.\" A hospital near heavy fighting was forced to shut down.

Captain Jose Fonte believes it is a big match because of the race for Europe rather than the visit of the Argentine. \u2018It\u2019s because it\u2019s Tottenham,\u2019 said the centre-half. \u2018They are close in the table and we want to finish above them. Obviously, there\u2019s that added bit that Pochettino is coming back, but for us players it\u2019s just another big game against a team that is next to us that we want to beat.\u2019 Southampton defender Jose Fonte (left) competes for the ball with Diouf (right) at the Britannia Stadium .",

I\u2019m eagerly awaiting his response. I haven\u2019t seen it yet. Andros Townsend scores England's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night . Townsend celebrates his strike with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Ryan Mason (left) and Kyle Walker . In his column for skysports.com,\u00a0Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs \u2013 he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn\u2019t get in the squad?' \u2018He said when the squad was announced that I should be \u201cnowhere near the squad\u201d. It didn\u2019t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I\u2019ve done that as I always have.\u2019 Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: \u2018Not bad for a player that should be \u201cnowhere near the squad\u201d ay @PaulMerse?\u2019 The Tottenham\u2019s winger\u2019s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: \u201cOh ye of little faith #Merson get in.\u2019 They could also have pointed out that Townsend\u2019s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. \u2018You can never stop proving things to people,\u2019 said Townsend. \u2018But I think every time I\u2019ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson\u2019s point. Townsend\u2019s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. \u2018I can\u2019t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,\u2019 admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. \u2018The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s my best form but this is the best form I\u2019ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I\u2019m over the worst of that. \u2018I\u2019m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.\u2019 After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. \u2018He is a top goalkeeper \u2014 one of the best to ever play the game \u2014 so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,\u2019 said Townsend. \u2018As soon as the whistle went, I thought I\u2019d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.\u2019 Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .",

        "text": "Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2013 which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition\u00a0asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues \u2013 but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE \u2013 WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I\u2019m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience \u2013 but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move \u2013 sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it \u2013 means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably \u2013 or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version \u2013 and Arkansas' \u2013 expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet\u00a0Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.",

        "text": "Vladimir Putin is planning to exploit the threat of nuclear war to force Nato out of countries bordering Russia, it has been claimed. A secret meeting between intelligence figures in Moscow and Washington reportedly revealed Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region. Notes from the meeting are also said to have revealed that Putin\u00a0is planning imminent 'destabilising actions' in pro-Western Baltic states in a direct challenge to Nato's promise to defend the countries from Soviet-style Russian expansionism. These disturbances are thought to likely involve cyber attacks or ramping up local ethnic tensions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania intended to unsettle the region. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Firepower: Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukrainian military (pictured) - who hope to defeat pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country - as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border . In Crimea, Russia is understood to have said that any attempt remove the region from Russian control would be met 'forcefully including through the use of nuclear force'. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. It is the threat posed by Russia to the Baltic states that is thought to be imminent, however, after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all raised concerns that Moscow has ambitions in the former Soviet territories, prompting Nato to establish a 'rapid reaction force' in the region. The threat of a Russian invasion of the countries is currently considered so great that Lithuania has gone as far as to reintroduce conscription in order to ensure it is prepared for all out conflict. Ready for conflict: Soldiers take part on in action training near the eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine . News of the growing tensions emerged as a new men's clothing label launched in Russia in the hope of cashing in on the wave of patriotism currently sweeping the country. The move comes ahead of a giant military parade planned in Red Square on\u00a0May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of end of the Second World War underscoring the decisive contribution of the Red Army to defeating Hitler and the Nazis. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. The design bureau of the Russian Defence Ministry, headed by Leonid Alexeev, showcased balaclavas, shiny 'military boots', sweat pants and tops emblazoned with the slogans 'Army', 'Polite', and 'Politeness conquests the cities'. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region.",

The storm is one of the worst in a decade, and many people were advised to stay away from the surf. The streets of Bondi were covered in sand, and flights were affected at Sydney's domestic airport. Workers in the city were drenched by rainfall, and lines for delayed buses snaked down wet streets. The communities affected by the storm included Sydney and some towns in the Hunter region. The damage was extensive, with hundreds of SES volunteers and firefighters working to repair the damage caused. There are flood watches on every major river system in the NSW Hunter and mid north coast area, and the recovery process is expected to take several days.",

However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'.

He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish.

Ruanne Dellal says her husband Jack was worth at least \u00a3400million when he died and the \u00a315million left to her was an \u2018absurd presentation\u2019 of his true wealth. The former beauty queen has launched a High Court claim against his relatives, in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Jack Dellal left his whole estate to wife Ruanne, but she is suing after discovering that it amounts to just \u00a31.7million . Daughters: Mrs Dellal is suing six of her husband's children, including Gabrielle, left, and Jasmine, right . Mrs Dellal, 61, whose own assets have been valued at \u00a341.5million, says she is owed a \u2018reasonable provision\u2019 following the death of the legendary gambler. Her late husband, known as \u2018Black Jack\u2019, was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in Mayfair and Monaco and gambled \u00a31.7million in a single night in 2006. His family dispute his widow\u2019s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon\u2019s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal\u2019s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a \u00a31million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received \u00a315.4million and he also put \u00a320million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian \u00e9migr\u00e9 parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top \u00a31billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for \u00a358million - more than \u00a3700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for \u00a355million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for \u00a3130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a \u00a3150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around \u00a356million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple\u2019s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain\u2019s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth \u00a3400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a \u00a350million \u2018secret stash\u2019 hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a \u2018strong\u2019 case that her husband had access to \u2018very considerable resources\u2019, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: \u2018It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.\u2019 Mr Dellal\u2019s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal\u2019s wealth meant there was \u2018no prospect\u2019 of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an \u00a38.5million mansion in Regent\u2019s Park, central London, a \u00a33million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple\u2019s \u00a35million home in Hampshire, a \u00a31.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost \u00a36million and has investments in the Middle East worth \u00a326.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been \u2018somewhat diminished\u2019 recently, although Mr Dellal\u2019s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal\u2019s case without further scrutiny of her late husband\u2019s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard.",

Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, an oil company manager, had been celebrating a victorious football game in their garage in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Wednesday. But moments after jovially waving goodbye to the last-remaining revelers shortly before midnight, they were both shot dead at close range in an attack that shocked and baffled the quiet community of Metairie. They were found by David's wife, Nicholas's mother, who had been in a bedroom when she heard gun shots. Scroll down for video .

Police believe it was a botched burglary . Tragic: They were found lifeless by Elizabeth Pence (center), mother to Nicholas (second left) and wife to David (right) moments after the shooting, which has left the quiet neighborhood of Metairie in mourning and shock . Charged: Police arrested Dexter Allen, 17, (left), and Haraqyon Degruy, 18, (right) in connection with the killings . On Sunday, police revealed 18-year-old Haraqyon Degruy and her friend Dexter Allen, 17, have been charged with the double killing. Neither have a 'significant' criminal history, officers revealed. The police investigation has failed to determine at link between the alleged assailants and their victims, or a motive. David Pence, a manager at a New Orleans branch of the international oil firm Baker Hughes Inc, was shot three times in the chest while sat in an armchair. Nicholas was shot in the face and back. He was found lying on the floor of their so-called 'man cave'. Elizabeth Pence dialed 911 to report the shooting, and the theft of her purse, iPod and iPhone. Friends of Nicholas, known to friends as Nick or 'Peezy', have set up a fundraising page to supplement funeral costs and support his surviving mother and sister. The family lived on Clifford Drive, a leafy part of Metairie, which is one of New Orleans' wealthier areas . Initial reports suggest it could have been a botched armed burglary, as Allen and Degruy were linked to earlier car break-ins. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said: 'Once again, this particular happenstance was completely, totally, shock-the-conscience type of homicide \u2014 obviously execution-style, very close.' Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told\u00a0WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.' Another friend said he was in the garage with Nicholas just minutes before the murder. Police believe 17-year-old Allen fired the fatal shots before running to the car and saying 'I just shot two people' to Degruy, who allegedly drove off, the New Orleans Advocate reported. Degruy has been charged with two counts of being an accessory  to first-degree murder and one count of vehicle burglary. Allen is being held on charges of fleeing police and two counts of first-degree murder. Weapon: Col John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office holds the heavy-duty gun which authorities believe was used to kill David, an oil company manager, and his son Nicholas after their party this week . A police report says the younger Pence had pointed out a suspicious white Toyota crawling through the street . Neighbor and friend Michael Soignet has described the agonizing moment Mrs Pence returned to the address, saying: 'She just gave me a strapping hug, and I choked up. She choked up. There were just no words.' Describing the victims to The New Orleans Advocate, she said: 'You'll never find anybody that's going to throw out a bad word on them, and if somebody does, they don't have their story right.

As a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity, Interplast, worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng, from Vientiane, Laos, inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt watched on. Turia was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big, brown eyes.\u00a0That's because she knows that if she lived in a country like Seng's, she wouldn't be here. Foreign doctors wouldn't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011. 'I wouldn't have survived,' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala\u00a0on Thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods. 'If I was from Laos or Bangladesh, no ifs or buts, 100 per cent I would have died.' Scroll down for video . Stronger than ever and inspired by a little burned baby: Turia Pitt (pictured), who experienced burns to 64 per cent of her body during a September 2011 ultramarathon through the Kimberley, Western Australia . Burned by boiling water: Little baby Seng (left) is pictured being operated upon by surgeons in Laos (right) in a desperate attempt to save his sight. Turia Pitt witnessed the operation . Seng's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from Interplast. Turia told Daily Mail Australia Seng was 'for sure' one of her inspirations in working for Interplast . Fitter and stronger than ever: Turia Pitt's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational. She recently ran a half-marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 Kimberley blaze . Turia, who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames, believes Australians take their medical system for granted. Her remarkable recovery is a case-in-point. Few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the Kimberley ultra-marathon three-and-a-half-years ago. 'I'm fitter now than I was before!' Turia told Daily Mail Australia. Nervous about medical complications, Turia was 'dumbfounded' when she ran a half-marathon last month at a quicker pace (1hr 45mins) than her time before she was burned (1hr 50mins). The only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km, as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable. Powered by a fierce determination to prove herself, Turia Pitt is fitter than ever, embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. The six-day-a-week program features three major planks, working on the burns victim's already impressive cardio fitness, strength and flexibility. If it sounds daunting, never fear - even Turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes. 'All of us make excuses, don't we? I think it's a normal thing to do... I think it's part of being human.' THE PROGRAM . CARDIO : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week . STRENGTH: 2 personal training sessions per week, involving conditioning exercises including box-jumps and squats . FLEXIBILITY: 2 yoga sessions each week, 'just to get a good stretch' 'Maybe I've got something to prove... I think I am more motivated' Asked about what motivates her to keep so fit, she told Daily Mail Australia there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon. 'Maybe I've got something to prove.... I think I am more motivated,' she said, revealing her intense, six-day-a-week training regimen. She is hoping to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. 'Compared to what I've been through, things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison.' There were many dark moments during her recovery, she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but that of others. Turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but others as well . Her partner Michael Hoskin (left, pictured during a hike recently) has been Turia's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal . On Thursday, Turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved Seng's sight, Interplast. She will also provide an update on how Seng is progressing . 'There were terrible moments when I just wanted to give up,' she said. Not self-conscious: Turia Pitt has always taken pride in her appearance . Only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose, terrifying her partner, Michael Hoskin, and mother Celestine Vaite, who been by her side throughout the entire journey. 'I guess I was really blessed\u00a0because I was\u00a0surrounded\u00a0by a really good support team, my partner (Michael), my family,\u00a0my friends,\u00a0the doctors, the nurses, even my local community of Ulladulla. 'In those really hard times I did draw strength from the people around me'. Given the nature of her work with Interplast, appearance was another topic Turia dwelled upon while talking to Daily Mail Australia. She said she has always taken pride in her appearance, which hasn't changed.\u00a0The burns don't concern her - instead, they are something she is accustomed to. 'Let's say you're at a party and you're self conscious and you think your arse looks big,' Turia said. 'Every time someone looks at you, you going to think, \"they're thinking my arse looks big\". 'But if you aren't really thinking that at all, you won't see it. 'I'm not looking for people who are looking at me. 'But then, if I was really self-conscious, I'd probably notice it a lot more - because I'm sure there are people who do look at me.' Years after the disaster, life is something close to normal now for Turia, who lives life according to a simple creed. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' she said. 'And that's kind of what I've always done.' As for baby Seng, it is understood his big, brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as Turia. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' Turia Pitt told Daily Mail Australia. That is the simple creed by which she lives her life .",

Two women wipe away tears as they take part in the memorial. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University . Politicians took time out of campaigning earlier today to offer their condolences to the Buckley family. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'My thoughts are very much with the family and friends of Karen Buckley.' Jim Murphy began Labour's Scottish manifesto launch in Glasgow by saying: 'My thoughts and the thoughts of everyone in the room go out to Karen's family. None of us can in anyway imagine the pain and horror that they are going through. 'Glasgow and Scotland stands with you.' Former colleagues and friends in her hometown in County Cork, Ireland today remembered the 'beautiful, smiling' 24-year-old who was dedicated to helping the injured and sick. Her father, John, said yesterday that he, Miss Buckley's mother Marian and her brothers Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Friends and family have paid tribute to Karen Buckley - pictured with her brothers (l-r) Brendan, Damien and Kieran - after a four-day police search found her body yesterday . Her body was found at High Craigton farm after a huge search was launched to find her earlier this week . Miss Buckley's former supervisor at the Hibernian Hotel in the town of Mallow told the Irish Independent: 'She was always smiling, no matter how hard the work. She could never do enough to help you.' Karen\u2019s former  school principal, Susan O\u2019Keefe, said: \u2018She was a beautiful girl and she was a great pupil. 'It\u2019s sad. We are here on a fine summer\u2019s day but Karen is not. We\u2019re all just the worse off for such a lovely person been taken from us, and for everyone in this community, it is a shocking tragedy.\u2019 Karen was a \u2018great all-rounder\u2019, participating in ladies\u2019 football with Clyda Rovers and athletics with her school in Analeetha, Ms O\u2019Keefe added. \u2018At that time we were a much smaller school then we are now, so we were just like a big family. It is a big blow.' Yvonne Bane, the principal at Miss Buckley's former school in Mallow added: 'The community in St Mary's Secondary School is united in grief at the sad news concerning Karen Buckley, a former student of our school who completed her Leaving Certificate here in 2009.

'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley's parents, Marian and John, came from Ireland to help the search for their 'cherished' daughter . Miss Buckley grew up in the town of Mallow, County Cork, whose residents expressed shock at her death . Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are absolutely heartbroken. Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than \u00a350,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching \u00a350,001 - ten times the initial target of \u00a35,000. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork. Karen went missing from the Sanctuary nightclub not far from her home. Police initially searched a park in north-west Glasgow before switching their attention to a golf course and farm outside the city . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Another little-one is undoubtedly dressed as Alice from Lewis Caroll's much-loved, Alice in Wonderland. The sleeping baby sports a blue ribbon hairband and clutches a pocket watch as well as a toy replica of the grinning Cheshire cat.

Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video .

Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority.

Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department\u00a0said\u00a0'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment\u2019s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa.",

        "text": "Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again \u00a0in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'",

        "text": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" \u2014 created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher \u2014 aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry \u2014 it's all been going too well \u2014 a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles.

        "text": "A father whose 20-year-old daughter was found murdered in Iowa last year made a desperate plea from China for U.S. authorities to do more in tracking down her killer, six months after the girl's body was discovered. And police in Iowa seem to have now answered it, by issuing a warrant for the girl's boyfriend, according to reports. Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported. Wanted for murder: An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for\u00a0, Xiangnan Li, 23 (right), the boyfriend of\u00a0Tong Shaom 20 (left), a University of Iowa student found murdered in September after going missing . Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed:\u00a0Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say\u00a0Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of \u00a0asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'\" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ... \u00a0share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'",

Knievel, 52, was speeding in an SUV on Tuesday evening when he rear-ended a Honda, causing a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles, police said. No one was injured. After the crash, Knievel drove off but his car was found nearby and he was seen walking about a block away, according to Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich. In court: Robbie Knievel, pictured in court on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in Montana after crashing into another car on Tuesday evening and setting off a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars . Officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol, but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample, the Montana Standard reported. Knievel was booked into jail. On Wednesday, he made his initial appearance in Justice Court. He has been in the area, where he has family, for a couple of weeks, authorities said. Skuletich says Knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but didn't give officers a name. The son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel has previously admitted to being an alcoholic and pleaded guilty to DUI in South Dakota in August 2013. Like father like son: Robbie is pictured jumping 21 Hummers\u00a0at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2008 . Icon:\u00a0American daredevil and entertainer Evel Knievel poses for a portrait before a stunt in 1976 . In that incident, he drove his vehicle into two motor homes as he left a campground and a blood-alcohol test suggested he was nearly three times the legal limit. He received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $600 in fines. His driver's license was also suspended for 30 days. Following the arrest, he spoke with 'TMZ Live' and admitted that he had an alcohol problem. 'I'm a frickin' drinking, driving daredevil,' he told the show. 'I ride motorcycles and I friggn' drink and ride \u2026 that's my deal.' They also asked him how he would feel if he hurt someone while he was behind the wheel. 'I shouldn't be drinking and driving 'cause I could kill somebody,' he said. 'And you know what, it would be better if I killed myself.' Together: The two Knievels are pictured together in 2006 - the year before Evel passed away, aged 69 . Knievel appeared in his father's stunts as a child and has continued working as a daredevil in his own right, while his older brother, Kelly, overseas the Knievel brand. Among his most famous stunts, Robbie Knievel, a father-of-two, jumped over the Grand Canyon in May 1999 - succeeding where his father had failed years earlier. To complete the jump, which was televised by Fox, he soared 228 feet (69 meters) across a narrow part of the canyon on his\u00a0a 500 cc motorcycle. Evel Knievel, who famously jumped lines of cars and buses, and attempted to hurdle sharks, canyons and anything else, passed away in 2007, aged 69.",

        "text": "Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported\u00a0witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, \"I saw this strange plane\". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search\u00a0has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia\u2019s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island\u00a0just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations\u2019 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .",

        "text": "(CNN)It takes a village to raise a triathlete. Since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full-time triathlete, I've been juggling training life with a full-time job, hectic commute and time with friends and family. With my Fit Nation teammates spread far and wide, this was a solo effort. Throw in a notorious Chicago winter that refused to go gently into that good night, and I'll admit it: I was not very diligent in getting all of my training done. \"Partner up,\" the Facebook status read. Jae Rockwell, the founder of my local women's fitness groups, Women RUN the World, posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable. And so that's what I did. I'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends. So, I reached out to them to ask what they were up to. Annastasia W., who's training for her first Ironman half-triathlon this summer, suggested a group brick workout at our local gym. She invited several other women, including complete newbies, through the SoleTri Sisters Facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold Chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes, bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes. That was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week. A few weeks later, I traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, to run a marathon. I traveled to Little Rock with three phenomenal \"fitspirations\": Samantha Goga, Natali Villarruel and Umber Rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the Midwest Vikings. Seeing how much fun they've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon! Swimming remains my weakest link. I just learned to swim last summer. Sometimes I forget that and don't cut myself any slack or recognize how far I've come. Once my formal swim class ended in February I found myself seriously slacking on my swim training. Enter my swim angels, Lovie Twine and Eanista Bailey. They took me out into Lake Michigan last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory \"swim\" (which was really just wading). It was great to have them join me for a swim workout. I appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching. And you know what was happening while I was partnering up? Spring was on the way! And that meant I could finally break free of my Computrainer bike sessions and hit the road. I was lucky enough to connect with the Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago (MTC3) for a series of novice rides they've been hosting on local trails around Chicagoland. With two falls behind me (hey, those clips take some getting used to), we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born. Riding outside with the wind whipping your face, chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and I'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors. I want to say thank you to the fellowship of fitness that I've been lucky enough to find. There are so many others we keep me inspired, accountable and motivated. I'm so grateful that they keep me moving in the right direction and I hope that I can help others do the same. So when times get tough, partner up!",

The 23-year-old Serbian-born fashion star, who appears in a solo editorial in the May issue of Vogue, told the publication that she was advised not to undergo her gender reassignment surgery because it would transform her from an interesting enigma into just another pretty girl. Andreja noted that there were people who warned her not to transition, explaining: \u2018There was definitely a lot of, \"Oh, you\u2019re going to lose what\u2019s special about you. You\u2019re not going to be interesting anymore. There are loads of pretty girls out there.\"' Scroll down for video . Fashion pioneer: Transgender model Andreja Pejic posed for photographer Patrick Demarchelier for a spread in Vogue. The 23-year-old revealed to the magazine that she is the new face of Make Up For Ever . Major debut: The model, who underwent gender-confirmation surgery last year, took to the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show in February (pictured) One agent even told her that 'it's better to be androgynous than a tranny', but Andreja refused to fall prey to those opinions. 'It is about showing that this is not just a gimmick,' she said of being transgender. Andreja also revealed during the interview that she has been signed as the newest face for beauty brand Make Up For Ever, and is thought to be the first ever transgender model to land a major cosmetics campaign. And her success is, she hopes, a sign that there is a cultural shift occurring within the industry when it comes to gender identity. 'There are just more categories now,' she told Vogue. 'It\u2019s good. We\u2019re finally figuring out that gender and sexuality are more complicated.' Andreja was born in what is now known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and later to emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. She grew up as a boy named Andrej, although she admitted that she was unsure where she fit in during her adolescence. She even considered being gay, but explains that even that 'didn't fit', saying: 'Society doesn\u2019t tell you that you can be trans.' Andreja recalled wanting to 'stop puberty in its early tracks' because she was worried about her jawline becoming too strong and her feet and hands growing too large . Fashion friends: Andreja posted this picture of herself posing alongside Kendall Jenner while the pair were backstage at the Giles  show . Two worlds: Before her sex reassignment procedure, Andreja made a name for herself as both a male and female model, having modeled menswear (L) and womenswear (R) for Jean Paul Gaultier . But at 6'1, Andreja, who also wears a size 11 shoe, fits in perfectly with her fellow models. On her first modeling gig she looked around the room and told herself she didn't need to worry because 'every girl in fashion is exactly the same'. Before undergoing her sex reassignment surgery, Andreja made a name for herself within the fashion industry as both a male and a female model, with her androgynous look allowing her to showcase both male and female designs. She modeled Jean Paul Gaultier's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2012 collection in Paris in July 2012, before going on to showcase the same designer's menswear range as part of Paris Fashion Week in January 2013. She took the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show show at London Fashion Week in February. And her new cosmetics campaign is just the latest means of her continuing to break boundaries \u2013 something which is already being echoed throughout the fashion industry by many other models. Last month, it was announced that transgender teen Jazz Jennings, 14, would be the new face of skincare brand Clean & Clear's\u00a0new 'See The Real Me' campaign.

        "text": "(CNN)If there was ever any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy. Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity.   Surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing the United States' overall carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. Well, think again. James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in 2013 that \"continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.\" Yet Wednesday, the White House will celebrate Earth Day and promote its work to fend off climate change, while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists. Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it.  This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation.  EPA's modeling is divorced from reality. First, EPA's \"Base Case for the Proposed Clean Power Plan\" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the Clean Power Plan.  This base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050. EPA's implementation modeling, \"Option 1 -- State,\"  shows exactly the same situation: no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050.  In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050. These assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets. A group of University of Tennessee graduate students made this point to EPA at a public hearing last summer. Using EPA's own data, the graduate students showed that EPA's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants.  The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase. President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model. For example, when EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill in 2008, the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation. Where did this policy shift come from? At a recent hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's California Global Warming Solutions Act when developing its so-called Clean Power Plan and that EPA's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free. Thus, EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others. Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they have hidden them in the modeling. For example, the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050.  This is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement. This anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order \"Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,\" which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions. Even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors. While I have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security, and I have supported legislation that helps to clean the air. The administration says it shares these same interests, despite differing avenues to get there.  The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key. But the Clean Power Plan and the President's recent executive order demonstrate that the Obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.",
        "generated": "The Clean Power Plan, a policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the US, has been biased against nuclear energy, despite this being the largest source of carbon-free energy in the country, providing over 60% of carbon-free electricity. The Obama administration's energy policy plan treats nuclear energy as an afterthought, failing to revitalize the nuclear industry or meet aggressive carbon reduction targets, despite James Hansen, a former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, stating in 2013 that opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid climate change. The EPA's modeling is divorced from reality, assuming that the nuclear industry is phased out by 2050, creating incentives for states to shut down nuclear plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants. This policy shift has been hidden in the modeling, and Congress does not have the authority for the EPA to make these choices. The Obama administration's recent executive order directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions but does not allow them to take credit for emissions reduction from nuclear energy unless it's energy from small modular reactors. Despite the administration's support for legislation that helps to clean the air, the Clean Power Plan and the executive order demonstrate the Obama administration's lack of seriousness about reducing carbon emissions or pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy.",

Since announcing his intention to retire in February, McCoy has enjoyed a farewell tour up and down the country as well as travelling over to Ireland, with the attendance at usually mundane midweek meetings boosted by his presence. The adulation shown to him has made the 20-times champion jockey realise just how much he affected the lives of the racing fraternity but while the decision to quit seemed to some to come out of the blue, McCoy feels he owes it to his family to go out at the top. Tony McCoy holds the jockeys championship trophy he won for the 20th  time on the day he retires . Northern Irishman McCoy shows his emotion at Sandown Park after the final race of his career . McCoy says the response to his retirement announcement has made his final months in the saddle easier . Speaking to At The Races on the first morning he could no longer call himself a jockey he said: 'We had a very good night but I've just got up and haven't got round to eating breakfast yet. I can smell it, though, and someone has done the right thing and cooked me a nice breakfast. 'It was very difficult to take it all in yesterday, the crowd, the people round the parade ring, the great racing public came out in force and I was very flattered and honoured by it all. 'To get a reception like that for doing something I've loved to do for pretty much all my life, I'm really going to miss it. 'I told all the lads yesterday to enjoy it while you're doing it because the end comes quickly. 'It's very nice to feel that I have the respect of people up and down the country. For the last 21 years I've ridden up and down the country pretty much full on but over the last two and a half months people have come out to give me a wonderful welcome and I'm very grateful of that. 'It would be very difficult not to notice how that has developed and I'd like to thank all those people for coming out and making the last few months of my career so special and making it a little bit easier. McCoy walks through a guard of honour of jockeys into the parade ring in Esher on Saturday . McCoy stands with his wife Chanelle and children Eve and Archie with the trophy he's won 20 times in a row . McCoy waves goodbye to the fans who line the fence and pack the racecourse to see his final ride . McCoy said he had initially thought he could go quietly on his final day at Sandown but his agent Dave Roberts helped him come to the decision of making the announcement early and giving racing fans a chance to say their farewells. 'When I decided to retire I always thought I'd go to Sandown on the last day and say 'thanks very much' but having spoken to Dave, he said I was very privileged to be champion jockey for the 20th time and we kind of felt, for my own piece of mind, to do it like we did would help me come to terms with actually retiring,' he said. 'We also felt it might be a good thing for racing, people probably deserved to know. 'I thought it would die down but it never really did and those are things I'll remember for ever. When I looked around yesterday, as difficult as it was it helped me realise I'd made the right decision.' 'If I'd carried on and maybe not been as good as I was a lot of these people might not have come out. It's hard to say it but it is probably the right decision. 'I feel satisfied through what has happened with my life but I've also said I'd love another go because I feel I could still do it better than anybody! 'I never felt like I did a day's work in my life, I've felt a lot of satisfaction and fulfilment and I'm very proud of what I've been lucky enough to achieve but so many people have helped that happen, I was just the lucky one who got on the best horse most of the time. 'The owners, the trainers, the lads, the horses, I could go on all day thanking people. McCoy said he thought he could retire quietly but is glad he's had the chance to farewell racing properly . Sandown Park was packed out for the champion jockey's finale on Saturday in Esher . McCoy said there were 'a lot' of things he would miss about racing but also some aspects of the tough sport that he will be happy to see the back of.\u00a0'Like spending a lot of time in a hospital and ringing doctors begging for help to make me better,' he said. 'Obviously my wife Chanelle wanted me to retire but at the same time I knew myself it was the right time for my family, my mum and dad are in their 70s now and don't enjoy watching me as much any more because of the dangers involved so it certainly makes their life easier. 'I never thought of the dangers and when I got injured I felt I was unlucky and it wouldn't happen again but I know the dangers and they first became apparent to me when I was at Toby Balding's and Richard Davies died and just lately you only need to see what happened to John Thomas (McNamara) and Robbie McNamara.'",

'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.'

Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said. 'It needs to be help that is not simply coordinated with the Iraqi government, but ultimately is answerable to the Iraqi government and is funneled through the chain of command.'",

Ms Edwards, a 55-year-old teacher, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on March 14 after spending the afternoon with close friends at the nearby Good Intent Hotel. Her wallet and handbag are missing but she has not accessed any of her bank or social media accounts. She is not believed to have had any enemies, but as Ms Edwards has no history of mental illness police are treating the investigation as a homicide. The family made an emotional appeal for information last week as police said it was a homicide investigation . Sharon Edwards, 54,\u00a0posted a smiling image of herself in front of a sunrise on the morning she disappeared . \u2018We can\u2019t think of anyone that would want to do anything to hurt her. We don\u2019t have any theories,\u2019 he said. Police and family say they hold 'grave concerns' for her welfare as it is extremely out of character. After police made it known they were investigating foul play, Mr Edwards said his family started to face the harsh reality that his mother may never be coming home. \u2018It could be a real possibility and I guess after all this time it feels like there is really only one outcome left.\u2019 Mr Edwards said regardless of how it happens, he wants his mum brought home. 'I want her to be found, one way or another.' 'We just need an outcome, at least that way we can all have some closure,\u2019 he added. It was first noticed Ms Edwards was missing when she failed to show up for a class she was due to teach . She has no known medical conditions and has not made contact with relatives. Mr Edwards said he and his fiance sometimes worked weekends and his mother was due to come to Brisbane to help care for his young daughter. \u2018She wouldn't miss that for the world,\u2019 Mr Edwards explained. The 'dedicated' primary school teacher did not turn up to work at Coutts Crossing Public School on March 16 and her estranged husband reported her missing the next day. On the morning she disappeared, Ms Edwards posted a smiling image of herself posing in front of a sunrise. In the week following her disappearance, police divers searched searched the Clarence River. Police also forensically examined three properties Ms Edwards and her husband own together, one in Grafton and two, including a vacant block, in nearby Lawrence.

Two-year-old Oratilwe Hlongwane, from Johannesburg, South Africa, whose DJ name is AJ, is still learning to put together words but is already able to play music from a laptop, making him a worldwide phenomenon . The youngster, who still wears nappies and does not yet go to school, plays bass-heavy house music on DJ decks after teaching himself how to select and play music with an disc jockey app on his father's iPad . His capabilities have earned him special appearances and sponsorship deals with fans desperate to hear him . His recent performance at a shopping mall in his home of Johannesburg gathered a large crowd as he bopped his head to the beat, with large headphones slung around his neck. His mother, Refiloe Marumo, credits his astounding success on the decks to his father Glen Hlongwane's decision to buy an iPad for his then unborn son. Mr Hlongwane, a gymnastics coach and aspiring DJ, had planned to download educational apps to speed up his child's education but also downloaded a disc jockeying app for himself. When he was just one-year-old, little Oratilwe learned how to use the gadget and started fiddling about with his father's DJ app. His parents were blown away when their son, who still wears nappies, repeated what he had learned on the app on actual DJ equipment, playing with sound effects and bouncing between songs.

As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on). Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Jason Roberts and Ian Wright fronted the BBC's coverage at Wembley . BBC presenter Lineker prepares to present the Match of the Day 50th anniversary special broadcast .

Stand-in Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan (left) with pundits Phil Neville and Robbie Savage (right) The excuse, I guess, was that Reading's nickname is the Royals, but as the second-tier team are also known as the Biscuitmen. The BBC even gave us a moment of history at half-time with a breakdown, something that used to be a regular feature of TV outside broadcasts, when a feature on Crystal Palace's shock semi-final victory over Liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through. In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent \u2014 David Jones did the job \u2014 but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy. In the commentary box, Sky fields Martin Tyler for its big games in the knowledge he'll rarely make a bad call, while the BBC never seems sure who its best commentator is. The man on the job on Saturday, Steve Wilson, is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story. The outcome on Sky was depressingly predictable.

        "text": "The Tennessee Supreme Court postponed execution dates for four inmates, effectively halting all executions while the courts decide whether current protocols for putting people to death are constitutional. Tennessee last executed a prisoner in 2009. Since then, legal challenges and problems obtaining lethal injection drugs have stalled new executions. In 2013 and 2014, the state tried to jump-start the process with a new one-drug lethal injection method and the reinstatement of the electric chair as a backup. The Tennessee Supreme Court has vacated the execution dates of the last four men on the state's death row as new lethal injection methods are challenged. Above, electrocution has been designated as a backup method . Beginning in December 2013, the court set new execution dates for 11 inmates. One inmate died in prison, and the execution dates for the others have been postponed as they approach because of legal challenges to the new methods. On Friday, the court postponed the last of the scheduled execution dates. It will set new dates after the legal questions are settled. States across the country have been struggling to find a method of execution that will stand up to legal challenges. And obtaining lethal injection drugs has been getting harder. As manufacturers have refused to sell drugs to prisons for executions, prison officials across the US have turned to compounding pharmacies, which make drugs specifically for individual clients. But those versions have also become difficult to come by because pharmacists are reluctant to expose themselves to possible harassment. Last month, the American Pharmacists Association adopted a policy discouraging its members from providing drugs for lethal injections, saying that runs contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers. Death row inmates challenging Tennessee's lethal injection method recently submitted an affidavit from University of Utah College of Pharmacy professor James H. Ruble that questions whether even a willing compounding pharmacist could provide the pentobarbital that Tennessee and several other states need for executions. Leroy Hall Jr, 48 (left) and\u00a0Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53 (right) were both convicted of murder in 1991 and 1985, respectively. They no longer have dates for execution in Tennessee . Donald Strouth, 56 (left) and Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, 64 (right) were also both convicted of murder, though the European Union has called for Abdur'Rahman, who is believed to be mentally ill, to be allowed to live . Ruble says in the affidavit that the main ingredient for pentobarbital is unavailable from the six primary commercial sources that compounding pharmacists buy their ingredients from. The Tennessee Supreme Court's recent ruling will vacate the execution dates for Leroy Hall Jr, 48, Donald Wayne Strouth, 56, Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53, and Abu-Ali Abdur\u2019Rahman, 64. Hall was convicted of premeditated murder and aggravated arson after burning his ex-girlfriend to death in 1991. Strouth was convicted of murdering a clothing store owner in 1978 by slitting his throat after he was knocked unconscious with a rock. Sutton was sentenced to death for stabbing a fellow inmate to death in 1985 after originally being sent to prison for child molestation. Abdur'Rahman, formerly James Lee Jones,  received his death penalty sentence for the murder of a Nashville cocaine dealer in 1986 while he was a remember of a militant Christian group looking to eliminate drugs from its neighborhood. The case of Abdur'Rahman, who was reportedly seriously abused by his parents as a child, has drawn international attention and the European Union called for a stay. He is believed to be mentally ill and had ineffective counsel during his trial, according to his website. There are 69 people on Tennessee's death row. The Tennessee Supreme Court (pictured) is waiting for verdicts about the constitutionality of the lethal injection drug pentobarbital . Tennessee last year reinstated electrocution as an alternative if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or a court rules the procedure unconstitutional. But that change has brought yet another legal challenge. Other states of the 31 with the death penalty are considering their own alternatives. Utah last month reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it can't obtain lethal injection drugs. In Oklahoma, lawmakers approved nitrogen gas as a backup execution method. The state's Republican Governor Mary Fallin supports the death penalty but has not said whether she will sign the bill. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf suspended his state's death penalty in February, citing the inefficiency of long court proceedings and expense. Ohio and Georgia are delaying all of their executions while investigation their lethal injection drug protocols. The US Supreme Court will hear a case later this month about the first substance in a so-called 'three drug cocktail', which is supposed to render the person being executed unconscious so they will not feel pain for the second two drugs. Scrutiny on the death penalty has increased since an execution using the drug, midazolam, resulted in an Oklahoma inmate writhing in presumed pain before dying 43 minutes after the procedure began. Tennessee uses only one drug in its protocol, the sedative pentobarbital. There are 69 people in death row in the state, according to the Department of Corrections. The Tennessee Supreme Court order said that their execution dates have previously been vacated for legal challenges.",

From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children\u2019s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases. A recent study of four major discount retailers \u00a0in the United States by the Ecology Centre found that 133 out of 164 products tested, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws, contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern'. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children\u2019s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases (stock picture) Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies, Nicole Bijlsma, told Daily Mail Australia that an investigation into products sold at Australian two dollar stores could produce similar results. Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies Nicole Bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin . 'Based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations, there's definitely a history to indicate that they [products at discount stores] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'It depends on the type of chemical, but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure. Kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time.' A set of children's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine, chlorine and lead. Bromine is known to permanently affect developing brains and present reproduction problems in those exposed to it, while studies have found that chlorine causes cancer as well as thyroid and kidney disease. Meanwhile, scientists have found that even the smallest amount of lead can affect a child's ability to learn. Dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals, including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects, reduced fertility, cancer, learning disabilities, diabetes, and other health issues, according to the report. She said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the United States, which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern', would find similar results in Australia . Additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic (also known as PVC or vinyl) and packaging chemical bisphenol-A (also known as BPA). 1. Buy Australian made products: They are subject to rigorous regulations and Australian manufactures are not permitted to use harmful chemicals. 2. Go back to basics: Use glass and stainless steel to store food instead of plastics. 3. Less is best: If it\u2019s not edible, it won\u2019t be good for your skin either, as it absorbs whatever is put on it. 4.\u00a0Try the natural approach against pests first: Instead of pest sprays, install fly screens and ensure no food is around before reaching for chemicals. 5. Leave your shoes outside: take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home . Ms Bijlsma, a building biologist, who assess people's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water, air, building materials and household products - to see what's making them sick, said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention, harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of Australia. 'About 90 per cent or more of our products, including footwear, clothing and furnishings, aren't actually manufactured in Australia. They're manufactured in Asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that's where the problem lies,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'To use a safer alternative would cost more money and sometimes it's just easier for company's not to bother doing research - why would they? In Australia they don't have to prove that the chemicals they are using are not harmful. 'BPA is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol-S which has shown to be worse. A non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates\u00a0(stock pictures) 'It's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in, but they neglect safety standards. 'It's possible because regulators don't ask for a certificate of analysis to prove there are no banned industrial chemicals  in the product and just assume that what the manufacturer overseas says is accurate.' A spokesman for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that while 'there is always a possibility that some products on the market might not meet accepted standards of safety' the 'chance is very small'. It assured that the ACCC had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are 'often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the ACCC' and other product safety regulators. However they also put great emphasis on Australian Consumer Laws which require suppliers to 'ensure their products are safe and suitable for their intended purpose', saying: 'most suppliers have systems in place to source safe products.' Stock image: Children's stick-on earnings sold at the stores were found to contain high levels of bromine and chlorine and medium levels of tin . Latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have\u00a0high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) Ms Bijlsma said not enough was being done by the ACCC, which she said only completes occasional spot checks, with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked. 'The system is based on just doing spot checks here and there, but it doesn't happen with every product,' she said. 'We have a mismatch of five or six organisations in Australia that are involved in chemical and manufacturing regulation and they are under-resourced, understaffed and it takes them years to regulate a chemical. 'The way chemicals are regulated here is primarily through self-regulation: it's based on a reactive approach system where if you have had a significant health complaint from a consumer, you are obliged to pass it on. 'Then they [regulators] list it as a \"priority chemical\", see what other countries do and talk to other organisations, and write a recommendation report - this takes years. Extensions chords were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates while plastic spoons were found to have low levels of chlorine and tin\u00a0(stock pictures) 'That's not adequate to protect our families' safety. It's not good enough. The system needs to change and the burden of proof needs to be on the manufacturer to prove the product is safe before it's released on the market.' The ACCC stated that products found to be unsafe are removed from the market or recalled by suppliers and that any company that fails to comply with standards faces a fine of up to $1.1 million. But part of the problem lies in the average Australian's trust that anything being sold to them on a supermarket shelf is tested, according to Ms Bijlsma. 'Consumers assume someone is regulating chemicals and that's where the problem lies. In reality, even 80 - 90 per cent of all the chemicals in household products like cleaning products and personal care products, have never been tested for harmful chemicals,' she said.",
        "generated": "A recent study by the Ecology Centre found that over 70% of products tested at four major discount retailers in the US contained hazardous chemicals above levels of concern, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils, and silly straws.

A 30-year-old mother-of-two allegedly high on bath salts stabbed her family dog with a kitchen knife because she thought it was possessed by demons, according to police in Maine. Aroostook County Sheriff's Office responded to a home in Perham on Sunday and found Ashley Doody acting aggressively and exhibiting unpredictable behavior. They discovered that Doody, who is a nurse, had attacked her mixed-breed dog, Trixie. The sheriff says the dog lost a lot of blood but was taken to a veterinarian and is expected to survive - while Doody is in jail on $1,000 bail. She has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and is due to appear before Aroostock County Superior Court on May 19. According to deputies, when they arrived at the home, Doody was threatening to harm herself with the knife. They discovered that she had stabbed Trixie believing the dog was 'demon possessed.' Police have said that they believe Doody had taken bath salts which can cause severe agitation, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal behavior in users.

        "text": "Police are now urging witnesses of a middle-aged woman's offensive public transport tirade at a Muslim woman to come forward after Daily Mail Australia published video of the incident. Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday afternoon. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing. A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the incident to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming: \u00a0'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' Ms Eden was not having a bar of it.\u00a0'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady?\u00a0What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent.\u00a0'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said\u00a0Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls. 'We really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot. 'All the best wishes for you.' One comment even asked: 'RU single? Lol'.

        "text": "Everton will look to extend Darron Gibson's contract this summer as he recovers from the latest injury setback of his career. Roberto Martinez confirmed on Thursday that the Republic of Ireland international will miss the final seven games of the season with metatarsal damage, but expects him to be ready for pre-season as he does not require surgery. Gibson has endured a wretched time over the last 18 months, not least when he ruptured cruciate ligaments, and his position at Goodison Park could be regarded as vulnerable, particularly as Everton will rekindle their long-standing interest in Tom Cleverley in the summer. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal . Everton manager Roberto Martinez expects Gibson to return to pre-season in the best possible shape . Cleverley, who has spent the season on loan at Aston Villa, will become a free agent in July when his Manchester United contract expires and, given they have worked together before at Wigan, he is a player Martinez will consider recruiting. But Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans. The 27-year-old was signed by David Moyes in January 2012 and has 12 months remaining on his current deal but his manager is already looking at his situation. 'This injury has arrived at such a bad moment because he was back from another long-term injury but it's something we'll look at in the summer,' said Martinez. 'I've been very pleased with Darron. Coming back from that sort of injury you don't reach 100 per cent for a long time. Everton will look to extend Gibson's contract this summer as he is treated for his latest injury setback . Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans despite holding an interest in Tom Cleverley . 'But when he's been on the pitch, he's performed really well. From the Leicester game, all his performances have been really influential. Though he's now injured, he's been able to show his worth and for me he is an important player that we want here for the future. 'We are going to see him. But I'm not too worried. It is a tricky injury because if you don't heal it properly, it could come back. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent. If he is fully fit for pre-season, that would be fantastic. We don't have another player like him in the squad. 'We are trying to support him. He can add that calm feeling, he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding. But it is tough, I won't lie. It is devastating for him. We just have to look at the positive that he doesn't need surgery. At one point, it looked very likely.' Cleverley is a target of Martinez and with his Manchester United contract running out a move could happen . Cleverley played under Martinez at Wigan, on loan from United, and has been at Villa Park this season . Having won their last three matches against Newcastle, QPR and Southampton, Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League for more than 12 months to clamber away from a potential relegation scrap. There is no chance, however, of them qualifying for Europe next season but Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings in the summer has been effected. He feels the club's progress over the last four years means they are strong enough to withstand this disappointment. Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League in over a year . Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings has been effected by a lack of European football . 'Within football when you face an opposition losing or winning doesn't affect players,' said Martinez. 'It's how you lose and I think every player who's faced Everton this season will have come out with a real respect and a real appreciation of the way we play as a club. 'We don't rely on 10 months of results, we've got a bigger picture of what we're trying to achieve and what we've got in the squad, particularly in terms of the younger players who have been given incredible roles. So I think the perception of Everton has improved in the last 12 months. 'We know the positions that we need to strengthen in the summer. It's something we've worked really hard on since January in order to identify those targets but a lot of decisions will depend on how we perform in the last seven games. It's going to be a very important end of season for us.' Martinez says he has 'got a bigger picture' of Everton's progress and does not rely on 10 months of results .",

Palmquist told show host Judge Lynn Toler: 'This sounds ridiculous, but he accused me of sleeping with the entire Wu-Tang Clan.' Sellers quickly fired back: 'She did.' The accused woman went on to tell Judge Toler that she did hang with the Clan on their tour bus and stay at their hotel until 7am talking politics, but maintained she stayed faithful to Sellers. She said: 'Nothing inappropriate happened and let me just put on the record that Wu-Tang is nothing but gentleman. 'They treated me highly respectful. 'I would never cheat on him.

        "text": "Muhammad Naviede, 60, (pictured outside the Old Bailey in 1995) was killed instantly in a plane crash . A banking fraudster with links to Cherie Blair was killed instantly in a plane crash minutes after he sent a text saying his aircraft was going down, an investigation has revealed. Muhammad Naviede, who was jailed in 1995 for nine years for a \u00a345million fraud, died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire. The 60-year-old, whose daughter is a former X-Factor contestant, sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on August 20 last year saying: 'I'm in a plane out of control and it's going down.' An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the message was 'unusual' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent. The experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the AAIB said would require 'considerable dexterity'. The report said: 'The pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying. He was familiar with the Piper Tomahawk aircraft and was in recent flying practice. 'It was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft, to such an extent that he did not expect to survive. 'However, after this message was sent, the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes, before entering a spin from which it did not recover.' Investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash. Mr Naviede, of Regent's Park, London, had previously undertaken aerobatic training, meaning he 'would have recognised, and been able to recover from, a spin', according to the AAIB. The investigation also revealed the father-of-two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight. Mr Naviede, whose personal wealth was once estimated to be \u00a3117million,\u00a0was the former head of trade finance company Arrows, which collapsed owing more than \u00a3100 million to overseas banks and other creditors in 1991. He was the father of model and 2007 X-Factor contestant Raquelle Gracie, who was in girl band Hope, and had a record with Pharrell Williams. The girls initially auditioned for the fourth series as solo artists but judge Louis Walsh told them to re-audition as a band and they made it to the live shows where they came fifth. His Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire in August last year . The pilot had written a 148 character text within 25 seconds - something the Air Accident Investigation Branch said would require 'considerable dexterity especially in an aircraft that may have been out of control' Ms Gracie, who is married with an 18-month-old daughter, is now a yoga teacher and continues to sing after previously hosting an online news and gossip series on website Dipdive, created by will.i.am. His brother was the former Government race advisor Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004. In 1995, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted him of seven charges of fraudulent trading, obtaining property and services by deception and making false statements to obtain bank facilities. On the day of the crash, Mr Naviede had flown the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk from Elstree, Hertfordshire, to Turweston Aerodrome before heading on to White Waltham airfield near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He was then due to return to Elstree, but at 4.55pm Mr Naviede telephoned the aerodrome to say he would not be returning that day and did not book an alternative destination. The plane took off from White Waltham shortly after 5pm, heading north, and when he was just south of Buckingham, he began to fly in a circle for almost an hour at between 2,500ft and 4,700ft. His daughter\u00a0Raquelle Gracie (far right) came fifth in the 2007 series of the X Factor with girl band Hope . It was at this time he made a number of calls on his mobile telephone and at 6.31pm he unsuccessfully tried to call the relative who he then sent the final text to. Investigators suggested that two minutes later he still had 'at least control of lateral flight'. The aircraft then turned to the left as the pilot sent out a 'Mayday' distress call, saying: 'Lost control of the aircraft and it's gone into a spin.' Mr Naviede then confirmed his location to the controller before saying: 'I can't control it.' Mr Naviede's brother was former Government race advisor, Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004 . The AAIB report said: 'It was apparent, from the witness accounts and the on-site evidence, that the aircraft had entered a spin from which it did not recover. 'The time elapsed during the pilot's final radio transmissions, together with the rate of descent deduced from the NASA videos, suggested that the spin was likely to have started from a minimum height of 2,500ft, and probably higher.' The report also highlighted strange aspects of Mr Naviede's behaviour on the day, although people who spoke to him said he appeared 'chatty, friendly and relaxed'. Investigators wrote: 'There were a number of events which took place in the course of the afternoon which represented unusual actions on the part of the pilot. 'It appears the pilot made a change of intended destination prior to leaving White Waltham. 'Having booked out for Elstree he subsequently called them to advise he would not be returning there. He did not book out to any other destination. 'After departing White Waltham and flying north for about half an hour, he flew in a large circular pattern for almost an hour. 'Although somewhat unusual, this may be explained by the need to re-charge the aircraft battery.' Mr Naviede, who had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience, died instantly in the crash and a post-mortem examination carried out on his body revealed he died as a result of multiple injuries. A date has not been set for an inquest but it is likely to take place in May with a jury.",

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim.

In fact, they were the drunkards banned from every boozer in Birmingham for a string of crimes including drink-driving a steam engine, riding a horse while drunk and being intoxicated to the point of 'complete incompetence'. They were all placed on the 1904 blacklist after four convictions under the Inebriates Act of 1898. The list was then sent to landlords who were not allowed to sell them alcohol. Scroll down for video . Boozy: Kitted out in a bowler hat and waistcoat, he may appear to be a right-thinking member of Edwardian England, but Matthew Moran was banned from every pub in Birmingham at the turn of the century . Black listed: Alice Tatlow was also banned from every Birmingham boozer for being 'drunk and disorderly'; publicans were told they could recognise her by a tattoo of the Prince of Wales's feathers . Barred: 46-year-old Mary Bayliss was one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham after being found drunk and disorderly . On the blacklist, each drunkard\u2019s entry includes photographs, their name, alias, residence, employment, physical description, distinguishing marks, nature of conviction and the sentence received for booze-related crimes. Offenders who were caught drunk and disorderly were ordered to work up to 21 days of 'hard labour' in comparison to today's fixed penalty or fine. They form part of the UK Midlands Collection, which covers a 400 year period and contains more than 21 million records detailing the good, the bad and the famous who have shaped the history of the city. Unearthed by Ancestry, the world's largest online family history resource, the records are available for all to see. Ladette: Elizabeth Thompson was a 29-year-old prostitute when she was arrested for drunkenness and sentenced to two weeks' hard labour . Rowdy: Charwoman Susannah Booton was arrested for drunken behaviour in February 1906 . Criminal:\u00a0Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their nose and face; Annie Hodgkins was said to have a 'fresh complexion' despite being sentenced to three weeks' hard labour . Poster: Unemployed Kate Kibble, another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly, was described as having a 'broad' build, as well as losing her right eye and having 'both little fingers crooked' Some of the bizarre offences committed by past Birmingham residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk. Nearly 10,000 Edwardian felons are listed in the UK Midlands criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of Birmingham's metropolis more than a century ago. Among those on the blacklist are Henry Bonus, 40, who was sentenced to a year's hard labour and three months' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham. Elsewhere, 18-year-old William Handley was sentenced to eight months' hard labour and one-year's police supervision for stealing a 'dead duck' and a teapot. Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute, before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly . Haggard: Just 38, Eliza Fallon looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness . Distinctive: Sarah Evans, left, and Ellen Heaton, right, could be recognised by their scars, according to the Birmingham archives . Records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds, such as metal cutters, grease merchants, labourers and hawkers. Many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps, ranging from Kate Kibble's one eye to cut marks on faces, broken noses and missing fingers. Some, however, lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole. It shows how those living in Edwardian England were just as likely to get half-cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy Brits in today's binge drinking culture.",

        "text": "Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. 'I think John Kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods, hoping maybe that the Iranians wouldn\u2019t say much about it,' the Republican lawmaker told radio host Hugh Hewitt during his Thursday program. McCain, responding to the supreme leader of Iran's\u00a0proclamation\u00a0yesterday that there would be no formal pact\u00a0unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah\u00a0Ali Khamenei, because\u00a0Kerry 'must have known' what the\u00a0perimeters\u00a0were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to\u00a0interpret it in another way.' Launching a rare attack from his official White House Twitter account, President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest in turn said it was 'na\u00efve and reckless' for McCain 'to believe every word of the Supreme Leader's political speech.' 'He shouldn't,' Earnest added. And the president's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it's 'very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased.' Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain . Kerry, is flanked here by President Barack Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice at the bilateral meeting between President Obama and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela today in Panama City, Panama. The Obama administration is in Panama to attend the VII Summit of the Americas . 'The fact of the matter is, we have framework,' Rhodes said, according to the Associate Press. 'The president has said if the details don't bear out, we won't have a deal.' Obama, Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other members of the president's kitchen cabinet are in Panama for the Summit of the Americas. Backed into a corner by reporters, the White House on Monday indicated that negotiators left Switzerland last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed. The administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear-related sanctions would be 'suspended' if Iran complied with the terms of the deal. The president said in a live statement they would be 'phased' out over time. The framework, however, he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, immediately cast a cloud over the United State's\u00a0assertions, pointing out that the\u00a0statement\u00a0released\u00a0by the United States' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions. Zarif indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be 'terminated.' Asked the next day about Zarif's claims, the lead spokeswoman for the State Department shrugged them off and said she wasn't too concerned with how Iranian leaders sold the deal in their own country. Barraged\u00a0with questions at his Monday briefing about who was lying - the U.S. or Iran - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute's potential for derailing a written agreement. Khamenei reaffirmed on Thursday his country's vow not to sign an\u00a0agreement\u00a0unless negotiators kowtow to Iran's demands and\u00a0promise the 'instant annulment of all sanction,' according to a translation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani similarly said, 'We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' Khamenei further stated Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn\u2019t allowed,' he said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters in Panama today, Rhodes also dismissed Iranian officials' rhetoric about the agreement as spin. 'They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal,' he said. 'The test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an Iranian leader, the test will be if by the end of June we have a document.' Responding to the supreme leader of Iran's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' McCain, above, said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way' McCain ripped into former colleague Kerry on Hewitt's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with Iran. 'It\u2019s probably in black and white that the Ayatollah is probably right,' McCain said. 'John Kerry is delusional.' Continuing, the Arizona senator said, 'I think you\u2019re going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that John Kerry claimed that they had.' 'So in a way, I can\u2019t blame the Ayatollah, because I don\u2019t think they ever agreed to it.' Republican Senator Mark Kirk on Thursday said, 'It\u2019s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement. 'At best, Iran agreed to disagree with the United States on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks,' the Illinois lawmaker said. McCain told Hewitt Kerry's behavior 'reveals that a number of things' about his 'negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the American people.' He also said he believes Senate Republicans are 'extremely close' to winning enough Democrats' support to push through a veto-proof bill giving Congress the power to review the formal deal with Iran that is scheduled to\u00a0materialize by June 30. Khamenei further stated that Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring' Even with out that legislation, McCain claimed that the Senate has the Constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty. Obama should 'read the Constitution of the United States,' McCain said. This is clearly a treaty.' And even if the president 'disregards the Constitution' McCain said - 'which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration' - Congress should have a say in an issue of this scale. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee who is exploring a presidential run, said in a statement Friday afternoon that 'the Ayatollah and President Obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements. 'Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,' he added. 'President Obama wants a deal way too badly, and his Administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist.' Graham said the Obama administration should tell Iran 'in no uncertain terms \u2013 that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties, sanctions relief will not be immediate.' 'Any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until Iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program.' Drawing on\u00a0Khamenei's comment about supervision, Graham said he would 'never' lend his support to a deal that doesn't allow for inspections 'anytime and anywhere.' With 'Iran\u2019s history of cheating,' he said, 'it would be incredibly dangerous not to require Iran to abide by an \u2018anytime-anywhere\u2019 inspections regime.'",

According to McCain, Kerry tried to sell a bill of goods with the hope that the Iranians wouldn't speak much about it.

The latest to open in the capital this week is the Oshun Caf\u00e9, which will serve \u00a36 bowls of Brazilian superfood acai berries. The sparse menu offers four variations of berry bowls, served with different toppings and fruit accompaniments. The Native Acai Berry Bowl is topped with bananas, granola, raisin and honey .

Liane Holey, founder of the cafe said: \u2018Brazil\u2019s streets are filled with vendors blending aca\u00ed pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl. \u2018Oshun Cafe wants the UK to celebrate this way of eating aca\u00ed, not as powder, dried supplements or in smoothies and pasteurised juices which have significantly smaller amounts of A\u00e7a\u00ed and preserved nutrients.\u201d The aca\u00ed berry is a rich purple fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.

Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It\u2019s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' The large seed from each berry is removed and the remaining A\u00e7a\u00ed pulp (along with its nutrients) is frozen within 24 hours of being harvested, due to the fresh berry\u2019s short lifespan. In Brazil, acai berry bowls are eaten around the clock. Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open in Soho, London in May . Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open its doors in May.

Nik Williamson of The Porridge Cafe . The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from \u00a32.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to \u00a37 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings.

Once the animals are done in the ring, they'll be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. Scroll down for video . All elephants will be phased out of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performance by 2018 . Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the\u00a0Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida . Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay\u00a0that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'. Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population. The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding . A spokesman for the center said that the organization's goal is to conserve the Asian Elephant, an animal who has seen massive population decline over the last century . Much of the population decline - which has gone down from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000 - has been caused by poaching and habitat destruction . 'Zoos don't chain elephants and the American Veterinary Medical Association advises against it' Delciana Windners, PETA general counsel, told FOX. The animal-rights organizations also urge the company to take the animals off the road sooner. Just days before announcing that the elephants would be taken out of the ring, PETA prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis. TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling\u2019s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone\u2019s safety,' the statement read. Animal rights groups, including PETA, have said that Ringling Brothers should take elephants out of their shows before 2018 . PETA released information earlier this year stating that\u00a0at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis .",

        "text": "On trial: Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . A former Ukip MEP fraudulently claimed almost \u00a3500,000 in European Parliament expenses - using some of it to fund his domestic court battles, a court heard today. Ashley Mote, 79, of Binsted, Hampshire, is accused of a string of fraud-related offences including acquiring criminal property and obtaining a money transfer by deception. Some of the money he allegedly made from the fraud went towards funding various legal costs he had built up as a result of being prosecuted in the UK for benefit fraud offences, a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court\u00a0was told. He denies 11 offences alleged to have taken place between November 2004 and July 2010. Jonathan Davies, prosecuting, said that as an MEP, Mote could claim expenses, including a Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, or Secretarial Allowance, to help fund his work. Mr Davies said: \u2018What the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009, when Mr Mote ceased to be an MEP, is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the European Parliament had been done by organisations working on his behalf.\u2019 Jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against UK membership of the European Union. They were the Better Off Out Fund (Boof), and Direct Action Resistance To Tyranny (Dartt). However, it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for Mote, who made claims of \u00a316,000 against Boof, and \u00a354,000 to Dartt. \u2018They were simply used as a front to perpetrate, carry out fraud and to receive monies from the European Parliament,\u2019 said Mr Davies. European Parliament in Brussels: Prosecutors claim Mote was 'using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud' Mote is also said to have falsely claimed \u00a35,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by Estonia based company Icos (Information Centrum Owned State). It is alleged that he even set up a Danish bank account under the similar name of \u2018Information Centrim OS\u2019 for funds from the European Parliament to be paid into, \u2018dishonestly obtaining\u2019 approximately \u20ac355,000. Giving details of Mote carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills, Mr Davies said: \u2018He asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an MEP. \u2018In fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to Mr Mote's prosecution for benefit fraud offences, and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings. \u2018Basically we say he was using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud.\u2019 Mr Davies continued: \u2018This was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which Mr Mote made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the European Parliament into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf, relating to his work as an MEP. Pleading not guilty: Mote (pictured again today) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost \u00a3500,000 in expenses . \u2018In total he dishonestly obtained approximately \u20ac355,000 and \u00a3184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled. It's not quite half a million pounds, but it's not far short.\u2019 Jurors heard that while MEPs were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the European Parliament, they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves. Between 2004, when he was elected MEP and 2009, Mote claimed a total of \u00a3750,000 in Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity. Mote was elected a Ukip MEP for South East England in 2004, but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of Nigel Farage's party because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. However, he sat as an independent MEP until 2009, when he decided not to stand for election. The court heard that in April 2004 Mote's case for alleged income support, council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with, and he was elected as an MEP two months later. Elected as MEP: Mote (pictured in 2006) was thrown out of Ukip because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud . But he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement, as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to Europe. The courts agreed with this and proceedings against Mote were stayed, prompting the prosecution to make an application to the Attorney General to review the matter. Jurors heard that in light of this, Mote wrote to the manager of European Parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this. He wrote: \u2018I have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the British government to unseat me as an MEP. This is going to incur legal costs.\u2019 However, Mr Davies told the court that Mote did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud. He said: \u2018What Mr Mote doesn't say is something along the lines of \u201cI am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an MEP\u201d.\u2019 Jurors heard that the Attorney General overturned the decision and Mote was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in August 2007. Mote denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property. The trial resumes at 10am tomorrow when the opening will continue. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Dave Roberts, who is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by leaping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees. However, instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - Mr Roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children's charity. Dave Roberts, who hopes to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, has bungee jumped off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence . Mr Roberts, a 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter,\u00a0said 'Daniel, this one's for you' as he jumped off the bridge - in reference to his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister who died after leaping off the bridge in 1913 . The 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, from Marton, Middlesbrough, said: 'I thought it was going to be sheer terror, but I actually really enjoyed it. 'I had a good moment just before the jump. The guy was saying, I am going to count to three, and then you are going to jump. 'I said, I need to speak to my relative. I said: \"Daniel, this one's for you. I am going to collect your winnings\". 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it.' Mr McAllister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in Port Clarence in a bet worth a sixpence. He died on May 4, 1913 at the age of 30. Newspaper articles from 1913 about Mr McAllister's death (pictured) tell how he 'dived to his death' and drowned following an 'amazing act of bravado' The cause of death was listed as: 'Shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the Transporter Bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink.' Father-of-two Mr Roberts, who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor, managed to track down Mr McAllister's death certificate, which listed him as a general labourer of Washington Street in Middlesbrough. Mr Roberts, who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week, said: 'A century after Daniel was killed, and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor, I decided I would have a go at the jump as well. 'But I wanted to do it as a charity event, and make sure I was safely attached to a bungee rope! 'The Daniel McAllister story has been in the family for over a century. 'No one really believed it to be true as all attempts to link it to the 1913 bridge jump had failed due to searching the wrong line of the family tree. 'Then we found a 1899 marriage certificate of Daniel's sister Emily, which opened a new route and this finally provided the link we needed.' Mr Roberts, who lives with his wife Francesca, 45, and children Kari, 14, and Luke 12, is running for mayor having moved back to England from a job in Singapore 18 months ago where he was vice president of business development for Fox TV. He said: 'This was all fun and games but I am a serious mayoral candidate for the town who has a great sense of humour and I'll be making a lot of serious points in the run-up to the election as I am a Middlesbrough lad who cares deeply about his town. 'Normally town mayors get set for the high jump after their term in office, this one got out of the way before the hard work starts.' He asked Teesside residents to stump up \u00a32.50 - roughly what a sixpence would be worth today - to support him and raise money for the MFC Foundation which helps children in need.

        "text": "(CNN)The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but \"inadvertently\" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. \"It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,\" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an \"excusable homicide.\" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. \"We're holding up all right at this point,\" Andre Harris said. \"We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation.\" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. \"However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,\" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature. But researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin, and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia. While the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random, as if the landscape is marked with freckles, the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells. Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. The illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells, and the one on the right plots fairy circles, which are also arranged in polygons . \u2018It's a completely amazing, strange match,\u2019 said Professor Robert Sinclair, head of the Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter (three metres to 20 metres) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon, or big freckles. Several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings, and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass, zebras rolling in circles, competition for resources, hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens. Desert fairy circles (pictured) are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form.\u00a0Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon, or big freckles . Now, Professor Sinclair and Haozhe Zhang believe they have identified a small, but vital, piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells. The duo compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells, according to the study published in Ecological Complexity. They used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls. The majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours (shown in this graph) The computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle. Another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago, which was used as a comparison. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. And the percentage of fairy circles with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells. \u2018I didn't expect it to be so close,\u2019 Professor Sinclair said. \u2018We spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe.\u2019 Mr Zhang, a PhD student at Iowa State University who was previously at OISTsaid that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. Professor Sinclair said: \u2018It is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar, but the fact that they are similar is already very important. \u2018This is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales.\u2019 Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, research last May claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are \u2018remarkably regular\u2019 in their distribution, which made them question the termite theory. Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Last year, German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography, where there is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. \u2018The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,\u2019 Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. \u2018A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,\u2019 the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.",

The researchers believe that both patterns may be the result of competition for resources, which suggests that similar types of patterns may exist on different scales.

Lord Janner sent a \u2018thank you\u2019 Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday. The officer said he was appalled by the Labour peer\u2019s note after his superiors forced him to drop his inquiries into Janner\u2019s alleged sex abuse. The note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue, and even invited him and his wife to dinner at Parliament. The revelation of Janner\u2019s apparent attempt to influence the police came amid fresh concerns about the Establishment cover-up of the Labour grandee\u2019s alleged paedophilia. Detectives have carried out four child sex inquiries into Janner since 1991, but attempts to bring him to justice were repeatedly blocked. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders announced earlier this month that he should been have charged on each occasion. But she went on to rule that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia. The decision has caused outrage \u2013 with critics pointing out that he signed letters in the House of Lords as recently as this month, and had held numerous dinners and events in Parliament since being diagnosed in 2009. It has also been revealed that Mrs Saunders was a pupil at the same legal chambers as Janner \u2013 although she claims she never met him. The furore over her decision grew yesterday as it emerged that: . The policeman who led the original investigation into Janner in the early 1990s spoke yesterday of how he was \u2018gutted\u2019 after orders to drop the case came \u2018from the very top\u2019. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, said his team uncovered evidence supporting allegations that the then-Leicester MP used his home and a hotel to abuse a teenage boy. He said he and fellow investigator Mick Creedon, now Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police, were prevented from arresting Janner. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia . \u2018Someone higher up told us that we couldn\u2019t just arrest an MP and it went no further. We were told that by someone senior, who I can\u2019t name, but the order had to have come from the very top. I\u2019m sure my bosses\u2019 hands were tied,\u2019 he told The Mail on Sunday. \u2018I was extremely frustrated. Janner should have been arrested. He was treated differently because he was an MP.\u2019 Mr Ashby, 65, added: \u2018The bit that really got me was that I later got a Christmas card in the post from Greville Janner. \u2018The card was an official House of Commons Christmas card and was handwritten. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, received a thank you note from Janner . \u2018It said something like \u201cI was very pleased with the way you treated me\u201d and invited me and my wife for a dinner at the House of Commons. I couldn\u2019t believe it. My wife was disgusted, as was I. Needless to say we never replied and never went.\u2019 The decision not to charge Janner in 1991 was taken just weeks after Sir Allan Green quit as Director of Public Prosecutions when he was caught kerb crawling in King\u2019s Cross in London. His deputy David Gandy took over temporarily until a full-time replacement was appointed the next year. But Mr Gandy, 83, yesterday said he could not remember seeing Janner\u2019s case file. He told The Daily Mail: \u2018I have no knowledge of it whatsoever. It may well be the decision was taken by someone else in the department or it could have been sent out for senior counsel to make a decision on. Whatever happened I simply don\u2019t have any knowledge of it.\u2019 Even Janner\u2019s barrister, the late George Carman QC, who was instructed to defend him after the abuse allegations became public in 1991, was astonished that he escaped prosecution. His son Dominic Carman said: \u2018My father was surprised that Janner was not charged. \u2018He suspected there may have been some attempt to influence the decision by the DPP, although there was no proof.\u2019 Investigative website Exaro said the four experts who examined the peer had not all agreed on the six key points about the nature and extent of his illness outlined in Mrs Saunders\u2019s statement on why she was not going to charge him. Janner\u2019s family have issued a statement insisting he is \u2018entirely innocent of any wrongdoing\u2019. Lawyers for Janner\u2019s alleged victims could demand medical tests to check the extent of his dementia. Child abuse campaigners have questioned how the former Labour MP was able to sign a letter to the House of Lords on April 9, just a week before prosecutors said he would not face charges because of his deteriorating dementia. Now it has emerged that Janner could be examined by experts as part of compensation claims brought by his alleged victims. Richard Scorer, of law firm Slater and Gordon, told the Observer: \u2018I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia, and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that.\u2019",

The revelation has caused outrage, as critics have accused the Establishment of a cover-up in the case. Lord Janner has been accused of child sex abuse since 1991, but efforts to bring him to justice have been repeatedly blocked. The decision to not charge Lord Janner was made on grounds of his dementia.

        "text": "(CNN)A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as \"Cassandra C.,\" go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: \"We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal.\" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then.  Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. \"She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment,\" he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is \"very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life.\" The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. \"The hospital is effectively jail,\" Michtom said.",

Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor, 30, received a Victoria Cross for his 48-hour effort that saw him lob live, palm-sized iron grenades from the trenches of Lone Pine to save the lives of his comrades. The Victoria Cross is the highest military honour an Australian can receive. LCpl Keysor even caught some of the bombs in mid-air, Channel 7's\u00a0Sunday Night\u00a0reported. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor served during World War I in Gallipoli and was awarded a Victoria Cross medal . The 30-year-old fought in the trenches at Lone Pine in Anzac Cove on the shores of Turkey . LCpl Keysor signed up just before the start of the war in 1914 as a pilot but instead was sent to the shores of Turkey. He had moved to Sydney after living in Canada for 10 years and had been a clerk for most of his life. In Australia, he discovered cricket and it soon became a passion for the young man. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said LCpl Keysor was an unlikely candidate to become a bomb thrower, but his strong arm soon solidified him as an asset to the Australian army. 'He's one of those blokes that's obviously got great hand-eye coordination. He should have been a test cricketer,' Mr Manera told Victoria Cross winner Ben Roberts-Smith who was hosting the Sunday Night special to mark the Anzac centenary. Every time LCpl Keysor picked up a grenade, he was risking his life to save others as Turkish bombs only had an eight-second fuse while soldiers were being killed around him. LCpl was awarded the VC for his 48-hour effort where he threw live grenades back at the enemy . His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, said her great uncle was a humble man who did not think he did anything special . 'He doesn't know how many seconds, how many fractions of a second he's got before he flings it back,' Mr Manera told the news program. 'It's a remarkable feat of endurance and every time he grabs one of those grenades he's putting his life on the line and he's doing it hundreds of times over a period of 48 hours.' Not only was he throwing bombs back at the Turkish army, LCpl Keysor was also shielding the blasts by throwing sandbags on top of them and covering them with his coat. His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, who penned a book about LCpl Keysor's life was told it was 'one of the most sustained acts of bravery' during World War I. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said each time LCpl Keysor picked up a Turkish bomb he was risking his life . The Sunday Night special was hosted by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith who served in Afghanistan . A Sunday Night re-enactment shows Turkish bombs as palm-sized, iron grenades (left), which were then lobbed over trench walls back at the enemy by LCpl Keysor (right) 'It wasn't something that was done in the heat of the moment. It was something that was sustained for days,' she told Sunday Night. Ms Lockyer revealed her great uncle was a humble man and referred to his time at Gallipoli as the 'only adventure he ever had'. 'I'm proud of Leonard obviously and Leonard made the comment many times that \"I didn't do anything more special than others. I was noticed and that was the difference\",' she said. 'He thought he was no more deserving than any other of the soldiers at Lone Pine that day.'",

When the once rising star for the New England Patriots walks into court each day with what appears to be an air of confidence -- or is it bravado? -- he enters from a connecting holding room. Some court security officers who escort him are as tall and muscular as he is. Besides that certain bounce to his step, there's usually a smile. Jury deliberations resume Wednesday . Watch \"Downward Spiral: Inside the Case against Aaron Hernandez\" tonight at 9 p.m. ET. It hasn't been there as often in the last couple of weeks when state witnesses have included his fianc\u00e9e Shayanna Jenkins and his former boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who testified Hernandez would usually greet him with a kiss and a hug. Always impeccably dressed in suit and tie brought in by his defense team, Hernandez quickly scans the courtroom, usually starting with the rows of seats directly behind him. The front row is reserved for his family. Some days, none of his relatives is there. But when his mother, fianc\u00e9e, brother and other friends attend, he winks, nods, smiles, jokes, laughs, flirts with his fianc\u00e9e and mouths greetings to them including \"'thanks for coming' and 'I love you.'\" Twice, he nodded his head and smiled at me. It's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins, appearing at ease. They've been representing him since June 2013. There was an unfortunate moment. His mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room. Given an OK, she reached over the bar to him, took one of his hands in hers and kissed it. Rules forbid contact. It did not go unnoticed by the family of victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez does not avoid looking in their direction. He glances at Lloyd's relatives. Lloyd's mother Ursula Ward, who is in court daily, appears to look right back at Hernandez without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row. When one witness, a high school friend, testifies that Hernandez once allegedly talked about carrying a gun, Hernandez appears to glare at him. When his fianc\u00e9e takes the stand and testifies Hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after Lloyd's slaying, his eyes are glued on her. She barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out. When Kraft is asked to officially point out Hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing, I watch Hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as Kraft detailed his outfit. When the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $40 million bonus in 2012 -- Hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom. Would it be the last time he'd see him in person? On the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case, he smiles at relatives. But as he walks out the door this time, he doesn't look back.",

In an interview with Town & Country Magazine, the 68-year-old revealed that he believes he has lost his natural flair for political campaigning, adding that becoming a grandparent to his daughter Chelsea's six-month-old daughter Charlotte has tamed the angry side of his personality which once helped to propel him to victory. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' he said. Scroll down for video . Back seat? President Clinton plans to stay out of the limelight if and when Hillary Clinton launches her expected run for president, he tells Town and Country Magazine in a new interview . Doting grandparents: The Clintons had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - a dream which came true last year when their daughter Chelsea gave birth to baby Charlotte (pictured) Undecided role: 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad,' he said . 'I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters and that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.' The interview provides a rare inside look at the couple's mindset ahead of a widely expected impending presidential announcement. According to reports, Mrs Clinton is currently in the process of preparing to launch her bid within the next two weeks, and she's rumored to have already signed a lease for her campaign office in Brooklyn. However, she has to officially declare as a candidate within the next two weeks if she is going to run. If Mrs Clinton is elected, the former President added that his wife 'would have to assess what she wants me to do'. In addition to his new, calmer outlook on life, former President Clinton may have other reasons for wanting to avoid playing an active part in his wife's campaign. Ready for more? Mrs Clinton is widely expected to launch a bid within the next two weeks . Looking back: The former President's role in Hillary's 2008 campaign was reportedly a source of great tension in the Clinton camp . According to reports at the time, his role in his wife's 2008 campaign was a source of great tension in the Clinton camp. Many of his political advisers joined her campaign, and some of them didn't get on with Mrs Clinton's staff. And this time around, Mrs Clinton is thought to be off on a good foot, holding a substantial lead over her fellow Democrats, as well as a top spot in general election polling. Mr Clinton added that the couple has not discussed what her campaign \u2013 or her potential election \u2013 would mean for their philanthropic foundation. 'We might have to change the [foundation] rules again. But we haven't talked about that yet, and I don't think we should,' he said. 'You can't. It's hard for any party to hang onto the White House for 12 years, and it's a long road. A thousand things could happen.' Whatever occurs, Mr Clinton's priority is to keep the foundation alive whether he's running it or not. Outspoken:\u00a0The former President previously sparked controversy on his wife's campaign trail, including with remarks about President Obama's 2008 campaign being a 'fairytale' ahead of the South Carolina primary . Groundbreaking: Mrs Clinton has the chance to become the first female president in American history, which would make former President Clinton as the 'First Man' The Bill effect: Mrs Clinton is ahead in the polls and it is thought that the Democrats would like to see her run for the White House. The family is pictured at former President Clinton's second inauguration . The Clinton Foundation is running 3,100 projects around the world, affecting the lives of 430 million people. The former President has spoken about life as a grandfather and how watching baby Charlotte grow has been 'a hoot'. 'It's amazing,' Mr Clinton said on the Ellen Show towards the end of last year. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.' Meanwhile, daughter Chelsea has said her parents are totally involved in their granddaughter's life, all the way down to changing diapers. She told Jimmy Kimmel that they are  embracing their new roles as grandma and grandpa Clinton. 'They're changing diapers, reading to her, helping her go to sleep at night,' she said. 'It's just been such a joy for me to watch them sort of rediscover that part of their lives and to watch them as grandparents.'",

With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'",

It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road alongside Highway 99, according to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. Scroll down for video . A fireball erupts after a large gas pipeline exploded in Fresno, California, on Friday. The explosion and fire closed both directions of Highway 99, authorities said . A firefighter watches the blaze shot well over 100 feet into the air. Eleven people were injured, three critically, in the explosion . The flames shot well over 100 feet into the air, witnesses said. Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2.30pm as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said. The driver of the front-loader was a county public works employee who had been working at the shooting range all day working on a tall berm that confines gunfire to the range, Mims said. Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said.\u00a0Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened at the gun range while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road, according to authorities . Pacific Gas & Electric crews are seen in the distance along the Fresno road after the massive explosion . Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital. Asked whether the driver was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded, Mims said her office is investigating. 'Hopefully we'll be able to speak to the worker to see what action he was taking at the time,' she said. Mims noted PG&E had, some time ago, marked the location of gas lines in the construction zones. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas. Kevin Ling was driving by shortly after the blast, and he saw fire flying into the sky. 'As I got closer, the flames were just bigger and bigger,' he said. 'It was shooting up to 200 feet or more, and a fireball maybe ten-to-15 feet in diameter. It was like out of a movie.' 'My window was up and my AC was on and it still felt like a furnace inside my car,' he added. Emergency respondents gather near the scene of a gas line rupture. Those who were injured were taken to several different hospitals in the area . Highway 99, a major highway in central California, was closed in both directions after the gas-line explosion . The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez said. A front-loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion, he said, adding that 'it was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area'. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the pipeline was damaged by a vehicle and that the line was buried but he didn't know how deeply. The flame from the pipe was extinguished at about an hour and a half after the blast, he said. Another PG&E spokesman, Keith Stephens, referred questions to local authorities. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured,' he said. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office is investigation as to whether\u00a0the driver of a front-loader doing work in the area was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded . The California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement that it is investigating the explosion in cooperation with the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under scrutiny following a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno. National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast. Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility - $1.6billion - against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations. The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department, said . Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast .",

        "text": "Google launched a new U.S. wireless service today that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks . Google is already the world\u2019s most popular phone software provider, and a pay-TV operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier. The company has unveiled a U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low. The service, called 'Project Fi,' debuted today, about two months after Google revealed its plans to expand its ever-growing empire into providing wireless connections for smartphones. Google is selling the basic phone service for $20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month, instead of a flat rate. Each gigabyte of data will cost $10 a month. That means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month. Most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money. Project Wi-Fi initially will only be sold to a narrow US audience that owns the Nexus 6, a smartphone that Motorola Mobility made with Google's help. Google's pricing setup makes Project Fi less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. The monthly prices for a single line of smartphone service with up to one gigabyte of cellular data at those carriers range from $45 to $50 compared to $30 from Google. The major carriers, though, offer a variety of family plans that could still be better deals than Project Fi. Those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data. Scroll down for video . Besides trying to bring down the prices of wireless phone plans, Google is promising subscribers that their Nexus 6 model will automatically connect with the fastest network available. Rather than building its own network, Google is leasing space on cellular towers built by Sprint and T-Mobile, which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to Project Fi. To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. In this map, the dark green areas are covered by the service's 4G LT, the lime green is covered by 3G and the pale green by 2G . Verizon 4G LTE coverage is pictured for comparison.\u00a0Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks . The service will work only on the company's Nexus 6 phones and only in the US . Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks. Overall, it costs $20 for basic service, which includes unlimited domestic talk, unlimited texting, tethering, and access in 120 countries. Customers pay $10 per GB of data. Data is paid for in advance, and the cost of unused data gets refunded rather than rolled over or lost. Phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet. Calls can be made via Hangouts on Android, iOS, and through Gmail on desktops, via the Hangouts widget. Texts can be made and received in the same way. There is no annual service contract required when you sign up . To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. Google is promising Project Fi will automatically switch over to an available Wi-Fi network if that is running at a higher speed than the cellular alternatives. T-Mobile CEO John Legere, whose company already has been cutting its prices and rolling out new options, said it was a 'no-brainer' to work with Google on Project Fi. 'Anything that shakes up the industry status quo is a good thing \u2014 for both US wireless customers and T-Mobile,' Legere wrote in a blog post. Google has an incentive to promote cheaper and faster wireless service as a mobile virutal network operator. This is because it operates some of the world's most popular online services, including its search engine, maps, Gmail and YouTube video site. The Mountain View, California, company believes most people will visit those services more frequently if they are enticed to stay online for longer periods, giving Google more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. Similar motives prompted Google to begin building high-speed, hard-wired networks capable of navigating the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than existing broadband services. Although Google is only selling its broadband service in a handful of U.S. cities so far, AT&T and Comcast are now offering options with comparable speeds in a few communities. Price in Dollars: This graphic shows how much Google's new Project Fi will cost for various plans. For Talk and Text only, the Google carrier will cost $20 a month as compared to $35 for new partner TMobile. However the savings really start when 5GB of LTE is consider - with the Internet search giant's plan coming in at $70 and telecom giant Verizon's costing $110 a month .

Woods has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5. That led to the 14-time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game, during which time he dropped outside the world's top 100 for the first time since September 1996, a slide which continued on Monday as he fell from 104th to 111th. Tiger Woods returned to action as he warmed up at Augusta National Golf Club ahead of The Masters . The 39-year-old is returning from a self-imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form . Woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at Augusta . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the 39-year-old only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta. However, after showing no sign of the chipping 'yips' which blighted his performance in Phoenix on the range, Woods produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long-time friend Mark O'Meara before playing the 10th and 18th alone. 'I felt good. It was nice to get out here,' said Woods, who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three-putting the par-five second for a par. 'Chipping is fine. I wanted to test out some wedges out here. That was why I was chipping a little bit more. It came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it's different from Florida. We figured the right one out. 'It's been a process. But I'm on the good side now. It's progression. I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament and it's finally there.' Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best . Woods stopped to chat to Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta on Monday . O'Meara, who won the Masters and Open in 1998, said: 'The thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate Tiger Woods. I'm a huge fan, a friend and I care about him. 'It was good to be out there with him. I saw some good signs. His pitching looks a lot better. 'There's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week. 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine. He hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots.' Earlier in the day, US Open champion Martin Kaymer said he still felt Woods was 'the man,' but added: 'Who really knows what is going on in his head? Woods looked confident and managed to pull off some impressive drives in front of the crowd . Woods hits a chip shot on to the green during the practice session ahead of the Masters 2015 . Woods smiles during the practice round prior to the tee off of the 2015 Masters on Thursday . 'I hope he's happy. I hope he's fine. I hope he will play well this week. But what would bother me a lot is all the speculation. You don't have a choice; you will read about it somewhere. You will hear about it because you socialise with people. 'So mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf. It's difficult and some things I don't find very fair. You know, you should just let him be. Let him play golf, what he likes to do. 'Sometimes I look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject. It shouldn't be like this in my opinion. But that's how it is unfortunately. That is how a lot of people make their money and some athletes, they suffer because of that. 'Hopefully he's strong enough, he has people to talk to, and he finds a way to compete as good as he can. Because we all know when he's around, somehow it does make us play better, as well. 'I never experienced someone who played better than him. In my era, I never played with Seve (Ballesteros) and I never played with Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, those guys. So for me, what I have seen and what I have experienced, he's the man.'",

'Gazprom has been able to charge higher prices in some . countries without fearing that ... gas would flow in from where . prices were lower,' she said of contracts with the three . ex-Soviet Baltic states and formerly communist Poland and . Bulgaria. Vestager said prices in some countries were as much as 40 . per cent higher than in others. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite welcomed the . charges, saying: 'The era of Kremlin-backed political and . economic blackmail draws to a close.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable' Noting the investigation had begun before Russia annexed . Crimea from Ukraine, Vestager said 'this case is not political' but acknowledged some would see political elements in it. Gazprom responded by calling the charges, to which it has 12 . weeks to respond, 'unfounded' and saying it expected a . resolution within the framework of previous undertakings between . the Kremlin and Brussels 'on the intergovernmental level'. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the EU charges against Gazprom were an unacceptable attempt to retroactively apply the bloc's latest energy rules to earlier contracts. Asked to comment on the case, Lavrov said in an interview with three radio stations: 'All contracts in effect now that Gazprom signed with its partners, were signed with full respect of the legal regime that existed in the EU at the time. 'After the EU adopted the so-called third energy package... there have been attempts, and they continue now, to retrospectively, retroactively apply those requirements to old contracts as well. That is absolutely unacceptable.' The EU has brokered deals to keep gas flowing to Ukraine . despite the conflict between Kiev and Moscow, but efforts to . supply gas via eastern EU states have been hindered by contracts . with Gazprom that prohibit the re-export of Russian gas. Gazprom had also pressured Poland and Bulgaria into . accepting unfavourable terms over gas pipeline control and . construction, the commissioner said. The decision to move against Gazprom comes a week after . Vestager charged U.S. tech giant Google with abusing . its market power, following five years of hesitation by her . predecessor. She said, however, that in other cases she would be . willing to negotiate with firms without pressing charges. The Dane has appeared determined to challenge big corporate . powers since taking on the powerful post in November, regardless . of past offers of compromise from both Google and Gazprom. Despite insisting she would look only at the legal merits of . a case that focuses on Gazprom's pricing policies for different . customers, the accusations will not ease frictions with Moscow . over Ukraine in which gas supplies have played a major role. Gazprom offered concessions to Vestager's predecessor last . year in a bid to settle the case and avoid a possible fine but . talks failed over its refusal to cut prices in eastern Europe. The Russian behemoth, with annual sales of some $100 . billion, supplies about 30 per cent of the 28-nation EU's natural . gas. It has been under investigation since September 2012, . including for hampering the flow of gas across Europe. Vestager can order companies to change their business . practices and is theoretically able to levy fines of up to 10 . per cent of their annual global turnover.",

        "text": "A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law \u2013 Section 6103 of Title 26 \u2013 that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded \u2013 and received \u2013 a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget \u2013 but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates \u2013 the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS \u2013 are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today\u00a0in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.",

        "text": "(CNN)An American teenager who helped her boyfriend stuff her mother's lifeless body into a suitcase at an upmarket hotel in Bali has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple's relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they'd be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. \"She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn't breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,\" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl \"before she could.\"  \"I couldn't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,\" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple's unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack's mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather's mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody. Journalists Fairuz Husaini and Ragil Lestari and CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Tehran, Iran (CNN)There is a Persian proverb that says: \"A good year is determined by its spring.\" For many Iranians, the historic decision by Tehran and six world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a \"joint comprehensive plan of action\" is an indication that this year's Norouz, the Persian New Year that started on March 21, will be a superb one indeed. Although edgy hardliners may now try to play games and complain the preliminary agreement is not what they had hoped, for many people it shows excellent progress and that's what they want. It paves the way for a much broader deal by end of June that guarantees the peaceful nature of Tehran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community. As is, the stakes are high and the choice is clear for President Hassan Rouhani and his \"moderate\" administration. They must now be over the moon: In early 2016, there will be Legislative and Assembly of Experts elections, the latter of which elects the country's leader. This historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections. So far, Rouhani's team has done nothing to improve the living conditions of ordinary Iranians who complain they have lost half of their purchasing power in recent years. READ MORE: Will Iran's Supreme Leader drink 'poison' of peace? During his presidential campaign, he promised to do so \"only\" if he could seal a nuclear deal with the world powers. And now he has. A full deal ultimately represents a referendum on the Rouhani administration's foreign policy. It will definitely strengthen his hand, which he needs to stay in the game, or better yet, win the next presidential race. The good news is that people are more than happy to welcome the preliminary agreement. They had always wanted a way out of the current impasse with the rest of the world and as a reward they could keep the moderates in power for the foreseeable future. Iranians blame sanctions and the previous hardline government for the sorry state of affairs in the economy -- especially the way they so poorly handled past nuclear talks of the past -- with devastating consequences. Many believe that now there is a joint comprehensive plan of action -- the culmination of a 12-year process -- there is something to hope for. In many respects, it's a new beginning and that allows Iranians a very small degree of hope inside themselves too. Looking back, the previous government traded those expectations for international isolation and economic hardship. Despite skepticism, even the country's leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, now feels that the light at the end of the tunnel might not be a train and that the talks could end well. READ MORE: What's in the Iran nuclear deal? 7 key points . Little wonder he had urged the nation -- including the well-funded hardliners -- to support the government's overture, saying the negotiating team was trustworthy and had been doing a fine job. It was a historic gesture that represents qualified support for continued diplomacy and that could lead to a historic step forward. It places confidence and hope in the negotiating team and the P5+1 group of world powers, guaranteeing no-one in Iran will stand in the way of principled diplomatic engagement and international rapprochement. Within this context, many Iranians are jubilant. They should be. More than ever, they are confident that not striking a comprehensive deal would be a historic mistake. They are confident it is within reach and this is as it should be: A win-win deal for all. They now strongly believe the lifting of international sanctions is no longer illusive. It would resuscitate the country's ailing economy and improve their lives. At least, that's what they hope. It's early spring and people on the streets are talking about nothing but the current choice. It represents the biggest chance of rapprochement between Tehran and Washington since the Iranian revolution in 1979. After all, for many Iranians this is more than just a nuclear agreement.",

Stancil, who gave himself fascist face tattoos, is awaiting extradition from Florida to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane. Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, told Raleigh's WRAL-TV\u00a0on Wednesday that he killed Lane earlier this week in North Carolina because Lane had made sexual advances to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Scroll down for video . Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, claimed in a prison interview on Wednesday that he had killed a gay college supervisor because he made sexual advances towards his teenage brother . In a telephone interview from a Daytona Beach jail, Stancil said Lane tried to take advantage of his brother. 'He ain't physically touched him, but he was in the proposal to try to and I wasn't going to let that happen,' Stancil said. Stancil said Lane was looking for Stancil on Facebook and found his brother. A Goldsboro police spokesman did not immediately return a phone message on Thursday about that allegation. 'I'd do anything necessary to take care of my family,' Stancil said. He said he has no regrets about the shooting. 'I did what I did, and I've got to live with it. If I get life, I just get life. 'I'm a murderer, you know, what the hell do I got to care? 'I don't give a damn if I go back to society.' Stancil, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) and claimed to have killed three others - although police had no reports of unsolved homicides . Stancil said he is a neo-Nazi who is concerned about the future of white children. 'I try to look out for my fellow white people,' he said. 'I don't believe in race mixing.' He was asked if he hates gays. 'Yes, I do, with a passion,' he replied, though he said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before he was fired for absenteeism. Stancil also told the television station he had killed three other people, including two in the Wayne County area. But the sheriff's department told the station it has no report of any unsolved homicides that match Stancil's account. The accused killer appeared in court in Florida on Tuesday where he admitted to the killing,\u00a0WRAL reported, despite the judge advising him he could remain silent. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth'. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime. They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. His mother,\u00a0Debbie Stancil, said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' The 20-year-old is facing a charge of open murder.

Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night. The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants' family. Auctineer Charles Hanson said: \u2018The lamp is quite remarkable.

Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion,\u00a0Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that\u00a0Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor.\u00a0'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place.",
        "generated": "Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied that partisan politics will derail the landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities. According to Corker, Congress has an important role to play in overseeing the agreement and ensuring that it is in America's best interest.

        "text": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with\u00a0a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.",

        "text": "Disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman (pictured) is said to have played the race card to silence opponents - and his deputy today reiterated claims there is deep seated racism in the borough of Tower Hamlets, in east London . A deputy of disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday appeared to blame the vote-rigging scandal on \u2018institutional racism\u2019. Oliur Rahman, who took over from the deposed leader yesterday, insisted there was deep-rooted racism within the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. His comment was at odds with a devastating legal ruling that condemned his predecessor for bribery and ballot fraud and found he had repeatedly \u2018played the race card\u2019 to silence critics. The two men \u2013 who are not related \u2013 are both members of the Tower Hamlets First party. Political opponents said they were playing the same \u2018cracked record\u2019 by seeking to blame racism and Islamophobia for their problems. Oliur Rahman told the BBC: \u2018If people say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, then they are very much mistaken because there is institutional racism. \u2018If people want to turn a blind eye to the racism then that\u2019s their decision but they are very much mistaken if they turn round and say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, and that people are not judged because of their skin colour and their religion.\u2019 On Thursday, electoral judge Richard Mawrey QC found that Lutfur Rahman, 49, and his cronies had rigged the 2014 mayoral ballot by creating an army of \u2018ghost voters\u2019, forging postal votes, bribing Muslim voters and using religious intimidation against them and branding opponents as racists. He found that all the councillors from the Tower Hamlets First party were elected corruptly. Oliur Rahman, 34, a former councillor for George Galloway\u2019s Respect party but now a Tower Hamlets First councillor, emailed his fellow members yesterday to declare himself acting mayor until new elections. He said: \u2018Following the verdict, I have assumed the executive role within the council, until a mayoral election is held.\u2019 Peter Golds, the leader of the Tory group in Tower Hamlets, said: \u2018Oliur Rahman ought to be hanging his head in shame and apologising to the borough, but I don\u2019t think he gets it. \u2018It\u2019s ludicrous to play the race card again. They roll out this hoary old chestnut every time anything happens. The real unpleasant racism has come from the ranks of Tower Hamlets First. \u2018They\u2019ve got one cracked record, that any criticism of them is Islamophobic and racist. Now they\u2019re playing it again, despite the court case. Nothing has changed.\u2019 Lutfur Rahman, who was Britain\u2019s first elected Muslim mayor, has met lawyers to discuss seeking a judicial review of the Election Court\u2019s decision that he was responsible for bribery and voter fraud. Supporters said he continued to deny any wrongdoing. Police have been urged to launch a fresh investigation into fraud in the 2014 mayoral election, which will be re-run in June. Lutfur Rahman, a Bangladesh-born former Labour council leader, has been banned from running for public office, or even voting, for five years. Four voters launched legal action against him after complaints that police and the Electoral Commission had failed to act. Andy Erlam - who launched legal action against the mayor with\u00a0Angela Moffat and Azmal Hussein (pictured left to right) - said Oliur Rahman was in 'complete denial' The group was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket. Mr Erlam said Lutfur Rahman\u2019s supporters \u2013 including Oliur Rahman \u2013 were in \u2018complete denial\u2019. He added: \u2018They are still claiming Rahman didn\u2019t do anything wrong despite a devastating judgment by a respected High Court judge who spent six weeks considering the dreadful evidence. \u2018It makes me shudder to think they were in charge of a \u00a31.3billion budget of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u2019",

        "text": "(CNN)Most kids want to go out and play when they finish their homework early. But Zuriel Oduwole isn't \"most kids.\" When she gets ahead of her work, she packs her camera and microphones, jumps on a plane and interviews presidents instead. Born in California to a Nigerian father and a Mauritian mother, Oduwole is often described as \"the world's youngest filmmaker.\" Aged 12, she already has four documentaries under her belt -- all of which focus on African issues. It all started three years ago when Oduwole decided to enter a school documentary-making competition with a film about the Ghana revolution. Jerry John Rawlings (Ghana) John Kufour (Ghana) Joyce Banda (Malawi) Jakaya Kikwete (Tanzania) Rajkeswur Purryag (Mauritius) Uhuru Kenyatta (Kenya) Goodluck Johnathan (Nigeria) Salva Kirr Mayardit (South Sudan) Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) Jorge Fonseco (Cape Verde) Portia Simpson Miller (Jamaica) Thomas Thabane (Lesotho) Ralph Gonsalves (St Vincent & Grenadines) Denzil Douglas (St Kitts & Nevis) After this first foray into filmmaking, Oduwole was bitten by the director's bug and quickly wanted to make more movies. She turned to the web to find the tools she needed and got involved in the entire filmmaking process. \"As I edit, produce, set up and write the scripts for my documentaries, I have to learn a lot of things,\" says Oduwole, who is self-taught and uses online editing and voice software. Her second outing, \"Educating and Healing Africa Out of Poverty,\" looked at the creation of the African Union in 1963. She followed it up in 2014 with her movie \"Technology in Educational Development.\" But it was her most recent project that catapulted her to international recognition. Released late last year, \"A Promising Africa\" (watch trailer below) is the first in an ongoing series which will profile five African nations, starting with her father's homeland of Nigeria. \"I've interviewed 14 heads of state and a few of those include the President of Tanzania, Liberia, Kenya, South Sudan, Nigeria and Cape Verde, to name a few,\" says Oduwole. \"I've also been able to interview business leaders like my friend Mr Aliko Dangote.\" To date, \"A Promising Africa\" has received a limited-release on the big screen in five countries -- Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, UK and Japan. The young trailblazer, who was named by Business Insider as one of world's 100 most powerful individuals last year, delightedly recalls seeing her film on the big screen and walking the red carpet in Lagos. \"I'm hoping that when people see these documentaries they will see Africa is full of positive things -- not just the things that are on the news like war, famine, disease,\" she says. \"I want to show them there is a lot more to Africa than what we see on the news -- there's dancing, music, great culture and more.\" Although she's just 12, Oduwole, who is home-schooled through an online Californian system, is already a 9th grader -- two years ahead of the rest of the kids her age. Her mother, Patricia, has a full-time job as a computer engineer, whilst her father, Ademola, has taken time off his work in the tourism sector to help organize a lot of what Zuriel and her three other siblings are doing. \"There really is a lot happening in our household but somehow we make it work,\" says Patricia Oduwole. In addition to her documentary work, Oduwole has also become something of an education advocate. She travels to different African countries and the diaspora on a regular basis to talk to students about the importance of education. So far, through her side project \"Dream Up, Speak Up, Stand Up\" she says she's had the opportunity to talk to 21,000 children in nine countries. \"Girl's education is important because on the African continent, where there are not as many resources, the boys are the first [to get an education],\" says Oduwole. \"The boys go to school and get an education while the girls stay at home. And those girls aren't educated and have fewer options in life when they get older.\" More from African Voices .",

        "text": "Sauntering down leafy avenues past typical Dutch step-\u00adgabled buildings, carpets of crocuses, the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal, I can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than The Hague. This is also prime territory for a gallery\u00ad lover like me: the beautiful, elegant and not-\u00adtoo-\u00adbig Mauritshuis was restored last year. This is also the home of Girl With A Pearl Earring, the 'Dutch Mona Lisa'. But I am not only here for the Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals. Much more than a village: The Parliament Building stands proud in The Hague - a hidden gem of a city . There is the Escher gallery (devoted to that geometry-\u00addefying genius), the contemporary art Gemeentemuseum and more. Meanwhile, I am being charmed by an unsuspected delight: this medieval city by the sea. 'City? This is Europe's biggest village,' says my guide, Remco D\u00f6rr. He is right: The Hague, despite being home to Holland's royal family and an eye-\u00adcatching parliament, was classed as a village until Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother and king of Holland) set up here in 1806. It has a genteel moat/canal, which encircles the historic centre. We step across and in front of an approaching car, which slows down deferentially. Remco tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons. 'Now, the cars are very careful,' he says. The Hague is home to one of the cornerstones of European art - Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring . You have to love that kind of Dutch logic - though it doesn't seem to apply to cyclists, who rule the place. Next time, I will rent a bicycle, although the trams and buses are easy and cheap (an all-day pass costs \u20ac7.70/\u00a35.60). Over the moat, we are in Noordeinde street. Remco ushers me into what used to be part of a palace, and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors. This cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes (I snacked in the Juni Lekkernijen), as well as altogether more assuming ones. HanTing is the latest Michelin star in town and the best place for Indonesian cuisine. The most prized Dutch colony was apparently run from The Hague (aka 'the Widow of Indonesia'). For summer: the excellent Grapes & Olives and the Caf\u00e9 de Bieb on Veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal, with music and boat trips planned, including a tour at the Kompaan brewery (I can vouch for the product). My art gorging finishes at the Panorama, an extraordinary, 14 ft-\u00adhigh circular panorama of The Hague's seaside resort, Scheveningen, painted by Hendrik Mesdag. I take a 15-minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at Catch by Simonis on the harbour front. The Hague has netted a new fan. British\u00a0Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Rotterdam Den Haag (half-hour taxi) from \u00a3100 return. For tours with Remco D\u00f6rr, email remco.dorr@\u00adhotmail.com. Double rooms at the Carlton Ambassador (00 31 70 363 0363, www.carlton.nl/\u00adambassador) cost from \u00a384, room only. More information on travel in The Netherlands at www.holland.com.",

Officials have complained the bronze sculpture of Yu The Great's wife has been worn down and discolored by sightseers constantly fondling the artwork, reports The People's Daily. The statue, which stands in a gardens in Wuhan, the capital city of central China\u2019s Hubei Province, is to honour Yu The Great, who founded China's first dynasty in 2070 BC. Officials in\u00a0Wuhan, the capital city of central China\u2019s Hubei Province, have accused tourists of damaging a statue of the country's first leader and his wife by fondling the woman's exposed breast . The sculpture, which has been in place for ten years, depicts Yu The Great, the founder of China's first Xia Dynasty in 2070 BC, meeting his wife . Legend says that Yu and his wife were brought together by a nine-tailed fox that lead them to one another . The bronze tells the story of how the leader met his wife, after the couple were supposedly brought together by a mythical nine-tailed fox. Over the decade that the statue has been in place, people have been touching the hand of Yu The Great, the fox's back, and wife's chest. While the rest of the statue is black, the colour of the coating applied to protect the metal, the parts that have been touched have worn away to expose the metal underneath. Over the years tourists have kept touching Yu's hand, the fox's back, and his wife's exposed breast - leading to them becoming worn . While the rest of the metallic sculpture is black, the colour of the protective layer which coats the statue, the fox, hand and breast have become worn, exposing the metal underneath . Locals accuse tourists of having a lack of respect for culture, but admit the behaviour is unlikey to change . Yu the Great is thought to have lived between 2,200\u20132,100 BCE, and is credited with uniting the nine early provinces of China. While little is known about his rule, as his predates the earliest written records by nearly a millennium, he is credited with building an immense system of flood defences in central China. These helped to bring prosperity and stability to the volatile region, and so impressed another emperor that he named Yu as his heir, rather than his own son.",

Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers. The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report. The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands. According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'. Boris Milat tells the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat\u2019s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim . The daughter of Milat's first victim (left) is told her father was shot by the serial killer. Former Detective Paul Gordon (right) tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been\u00a0been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl\u2019s stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of\u00a094 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she\u2019s 25, white. I ought to ask her \u201cwhy\u201d as she only knows me from a website, and there\u2019s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al . In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope . One of his letters revealed plans to cut off his own finger and mail it law enforcement. \u2018I will send them parts of my hand first, I have been considering this for a while and only need half a reason to show them how I feel with their sh**head ideas, there is not much they can do to me any more and at my age I don't give a f**k,' an excerpt from his letters reads.

Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking \"I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones\".' Scroll down for video . The footage shows climber Karlis Bardelis carefully traversing the ridge, left, but one wrong move sends him tumbling down the icy cliff face in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, right . You see his feet literally above his head as he continues to fall down the mountain head-first . Karlis Bardelis, left, and Gary Kinsey, right, on Headhunter's summit on January 28, 2012. Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital . Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in the video below, you can see the axe slipping out of the ice and knocking his other axe out of position. Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety rope after falling ten metres. But the experienced Latvian climber, who now works in Nepal, held his nerve after the tumble and even continued his ascent to the top. Bardelis scaling the mountain which he fell from. On the left you can see the safety rope that saved his life . Holding his nerve: The experienced climber grips the rock face on his ascent . He said: 'My ropes saved me and stopped my fall. 'These kind of falls are very dangerous because I'm carrying two ice tools and crampons, both of which are really sharp and could cause serious injuries. 'Obviously there's the risk of hitting a rock on my way down, which can cause serious fractures. 'I never think that I'm going to die in these situations - I never consider death as an option' Karlis had travelled to Scotland to take part in a training course organised by the British Mountaineering Council joining climbers from 26 countries. And he attempted the level six climb with some trepidation. Life on the line: Bardelis was rescued by his safety rope after his axe became dislodged from the ice, knocking the other out of position and sending him plunging down the mountain . He said: 'I was feeling excited about that climb but at the same time I was feeling scared in those difficult parts too. 'I fell because I made a mistake; I put one ice axe in a crack and was trying to put another one in but the placement wasn't good so it ripped the other one out. 'My crampons weren't in a stable place so I fell.' The footage shows Karlis tumble backwards from the cliff face and free fall towards the ground. Incredibly, after being saved by his harness, Karlis continued his ascent after the fall. He said: 'I climbed back to the same place and this time did it right using the same technique. 'Some people laugh when they see the video - others say they are not going to sleep after seeing it. 'I guess it was a good example of how not to climb.' Top class: The Latvian is an experience climber who now works in Nepal. When he began falling, all he could dow was hope that he landed somewhere soft and didn't break any bones, he said .",

        "text": "Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer\u2019s eponymous brand\u2019s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece\u00a0Lilly Pulitzer for Target\u00a0collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel\u00a0that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home d\u00e9cor\u00a0from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the\u00a0#LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell\u00a0them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn\u2019t get there with this launch and for that, we\u2019re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That\u2019s frustrating, both for them and for us. We\u2019re taking a close look at what happened. We\u2019re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we\u2019re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we\u2019ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it\u2019s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection.

But though frustrated fans\u00a0criticized\u00a0Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are\u00a0hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores.

The 250-piece collection sold out online and in stores shortly after it debuted, leaving many disappointed customers and resellers. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock, but Liza Pulitzer, the designer's daughter, missed out. The older Ms. Pulitzer's sister, who died in 2013, would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something from the collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise, which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point, attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores. Many of these popular products have now officially sold out, prompting angry customers who were unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration to boycott second-hand sellers of the merchandise.",

        "text": "Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. The SNP leader has denied telling French ambassador Sylvie Bermann that she would prefer David Cameron to remain in Number 10 while suggesting that Ed Miliband was not Prime Minister material. Ms Sturgeon told supporters at a rally in Glasgow today that she had written to Sir Jeremy to demand an official investigation. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate the leaked memo . She told supporters in Glasgow today that the Westminster establishment were afraid of the SNP's rise and called on Ed Miliband to commit to 'locking out' David Cameron from Downing Street next month . Ms Sturgeon completely denied claims that she secretly hoped David Cameron would win the election . She claimed that the story was a sign of 'panic' within the Westminster establishment over the surge of support for her party. She then called on Mr Miliband to publicly commit to working with the SNP to 'lock out' Mr Cameron from Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament. Ms Sturgeon described the account of her conversation with the French ambassador as '100 per cent untrue'. The memo was published in the Daily Telegraph was written by a British civil servant following a conversation with consul-general Pierre-Alain Coffinier regarding the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and ambassador Sylvie Bermann, who was on her first visit to Scotland in February. According to the memo: 'Discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation, with the FM stating that she wouldn't want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she'd rather see David Cameron remain as PM.' The note went on to say that Ms Sturgeon had said she did not think Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'prime minister material'. The civil servant added: 'I have to admit that I'm not sure that the FM's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that, so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation'. Mr Coffinier - who was at the meeting - told Sky News that he had no recollection of Ms Sturgeon's alleged comments. He said: 'I do not know where this comes from, because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference.' David Cameron, pictured today, said any deal between Labour and the SNP would be a 'chaos alliance' A spokesman for the Ms Bermann said: 'While the Ambassador and First Minister, some time ago, discussed the political situation, Ms Sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister.' Attending an anti-nuclear rally in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: \"This story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the French Ambassador and Consul General. 'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as \u2018prime minister material\u2019, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader\u2019s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP\u2019s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an \u2018out\u2019 vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: \u2018The first minister confessed that she\u2019d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn\u2019t see Ed Miliband as PM material).\u2019 She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: \u00a3148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal . Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority . Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.",

These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Fredric Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High, Irvington, New Jersey. They were taken at the age of 18, when he was, in his own words, just \u2018a Jewish kid from Newark,\u2019 and before he had transformed himself, in every sense, into the figure lampooned on Netflix show \u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u2019 with such devastating consequences. Scroll down for video .

Dispirited: The famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. He had been left \u2018devastated\u2019 by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey\u2019s Netflix show . Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor \u2013 who had been suffering from depression \u2013 had been left \u2018devastated\u2019 by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey\u2019s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt\u2019s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school\u2019s yearbook earned him a reputation for his \u2018infectious grin\u2019 and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as \u2018Fred\u2019 he was a popular and \u2018scholarly\u2019 student with, it was noted, the promise of a \u2018medical career ahead.\u2019 Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was \u2018more of a different child,\u2019 as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: \u2018I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things. I was always questioning everything to see how it worked.\u2019 In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth \u2013 he had hundreds of patients, saw as many as 30 daily with some paying as much as $7,000 a pop and had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store. Three years before he graduated and before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt\u2019s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly.

The awards and accolades followed him from this 1967 yearbook through his professional career . Speaking to the New York Times last March he admitted: \u2018It was a lot to process, but you just have to forge ahead.\u2019 He certainly did. Immediately after high school he attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University\u2019s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters. As a student he loved oncology, nephrology, hematology and cardiology. The one area of medicine in which the life-long bachelor took no real pleasure was pediatrics. He explained: \u2018You spent all your time calming patients down.\u2019 Between 1976 and 1978 he completed his internship at New York University Veterans Administration before going onto specialise in dermatology at the University of Miami, 1978\u20131981. He set up a private practice in Miami and it was only in 1998 that an invitation to use a colleague\u2019s New York office once a month to treat patients with ever evolving newly introduced facial fillers led Dr Brandt to his ultimate area of expertise.

Hurtful parody: According to those closest to Brandt, the doctor \u2013 who had been suffering from depression \u2013 had been left \u2018devastated\u2019 by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey\u2019s Netflix show . Tina Fey takes a selfie with Maya Rudolph and \u00a0Martin Short last February. Poignantly, given his own unhappy demise, Dr Brandt\u2019s ambition in his work had always been, he said, \u2018to restore a face to harmony,\u2019 and \u2018to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves.\u2019 He built an empire on his work. As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on \u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019 as Dr Franff. The good life: In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth. He had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store . Played by Martin Short Franff\u2019s transformation is so grotesque that he can barely utter certain words \u2013 including his own name. He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being \u2018a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,\u2019 the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep. There have been many tributes since his death Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, yesterday tweeted, \u2018Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.\u2019 Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: \u2018My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr Frederic Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer.\u2019",

        "text": "A prankster who pretended he had put his girlfriend's dog in a washing machine got a very painful comeuppance after she\u00a0glued him to a chair- naked. Dominika Petrinova, from the Czech Republic, was furious after her\u00a0boyfriend Erik Meldik's prank, which went viral after he posted it online. The 27-year-old had burst into tears when she was told her dog Sam had accidentally been put in the wash before Mr Meldik revealed the 'joke' and that her beloved pet was safe and sound. Ouch!\u00a0Erik Meldik screamed in pain as he tried to pull himself free after being glued to a chair by his girlfriend . Dominika Petrinova decided to get her painful revenge by gluing wax strips to the plastic chair after her boyfriend's previous prank where he told her that their pet dog called Sam was in the washing machine . So Ms Petrinova had decided to exact her revenge in a painful prank of her own. This hilarious video shows her setting up the gag by super gluing the waxing strips to a plastic office chair. She then cruelly promised her boyfriend, who had celebrated his birthday the day before, a special treat. Ms Petrinova then led him - naked and blindfolded - into the room and onto the booby-trapped chair. After cruelly telling him she has a birthday surprise in store, Ms Petrinova blindfolds her naked boyfriend before getting him to sit down on the booby-trapped seat . Trapped: The realization sinks in that Erik Meldik is stuck that he glued to the chair by the waxing tape on his genitals . It takes a few moments for him to realise what  happened while Ms Petrinova was heard laughing in the background. Panic then flashed across his face as he clicked he was stuck to the chair by his genitals and he asked his giggling girlfriend: 'Are you\u00a0kidding\u00a0me? You are pranking me now? Mr Meldik, 31, cried and screamed as he tried to free himself, before he eventually ripped himself off the chair, leaving a fair portion of skin and hair behind in the process. Ms Petrinova films her partner Mr Meldik as he tries and fails in his attempts to free himself from the office chair . Mr Meldik sheds a tear when he realises that he is well and truly stuck and will have to rip himself free . The victim of the prank and his friend Cenek Styblo, 29, are known in their Czech homeland as 'the Viral Brothers' and are famous for carrying out stunts often on each other or their respective girlfriends. But Ms Petrinova said she had decided the dog in the washing machine stunt was too much, and wanted to teach her boyfriend a painful lesson that he would not forget in a hurry. She said: 'I was really upset when I thought Sam was in the washing machine, and he was running after me saying he was sorry but he clearly wasn't because he was filming it and put it all online. 'Well, now I am pretty sure he is genuinely sorry.' He screams as he uses a set of drawers to try and yank himself off the strips which are stuck to his genitals . He finally pulls himself free leaving behind a fair portion of skin behind on the waxing strips in the process . In recovery: Mr Meldik cries as he lies on the bed after the painful prank which was carried out in revenge for an earlier stunt where he pretended to accidentally have put his girlfriend's dog in the washing machine . The 27-year-old had burst into tears when she was told her dog Sam had accidentally been put in the wash before Mr Meldik revealed the 'joke' - prompting her to seek revenge .",

        "text": "Benik Afobe\u2019s first-half finish kept Wolves slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10-man Wigan to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the DW Stadium. Afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football\u2019s third-tier after a dreadful season. To make matters worse, the Latics will have to face Brentford next weekend without star man James McClean who received his marching orders in injury-time for a second bookable offence. Wolverhampton's Benik Afobe (right) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1-0 defeat of Wigan . The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Pearce, Perch, Maguire; Boyce, Chow (Cowie 79), Kvist (Fortune 56), Bong, Bo-kyung; McClean, Pennant (McKay 68) Subs not used: Al Habsi, Taylor, McCann, Cowie, Barnett . Booked: Boyce, Bong, Fortune, McClean (sent off) Wolves: Kuszczak; Iorfa, Ebanks-Landell, Stearman (c), Golbourne; Edwards, McDonald, Price, Sako (Hause 82); Afobe, Dicko (Doyle 82) Subs not used: Flatt, Doherty, Henry, van La Parra, Jacobs . Booked: Iorfa, Stearman and Dicko . Scorer: Afobe 25 . Referee: J Linington . Attendance: 16,810 . The Latics now have to hope Rotherham fail against Reading on Tuesday and Leeds United next weekend while they win at Griffin Park on the last day of the season. Wigan\u2019s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north-west club who lifted the FA Cup just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013. They once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in England\u2019s top-flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season. And, worryingly enough for their fans, if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season \u2013 but only just. The stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as Kenny Jackett\u2019s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play-off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six. Afobe races past\u00a0Wigan's Gaetan Bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive . Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce drops to his knees as the former FA Cup winners head towards the drop . Gary Caldwell, the former Wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following Malky Mackay\u2019s sacking earlier this month, again called for the club\u2019s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players\u2019 carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant. A healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up Wigan\u2019s entire season. They home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds \u2013 and the drop \u2013 and McClean should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes. Caldwell\u2019s influence on Wigan has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either Uwe Rosler or Mackay. But killer instinct is in short supply \u2013 and it showed. Former Stoke star Jermaine Pennant was the next to test Wolves defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term. A Bakary Sako free-kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by Afobe who could not miss from three yards out as Wigan\u2019s defence stood and watched. As news filtered around the DW Stadium that Derby were losing at Millwall, and that Wolves were just a point outside the top-six as a consequence, Jackett\u2019s side looked to press home their advantage against a Wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration. However, neither side created any real clear-cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators. After the break, Wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although McClean, Pennant and Bo-kyung tried to link up and break down Wolves, they again lacked any real cutting edge. Wigan's James Perch and Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune head off dejected after the final whistle . Wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands . However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. With half an hour to go, Wolves should have been 2-0 up but Wigan had keeper Carson to thank for blocking Dicko as he ran through on goal. And Carson was also at his best soon after when Afobe\u2019s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by Dave Edwards but the former England No.1 brilliantly tipped over to keep the Latics in the contest. His team-mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at Wolves with James Perch and McClean both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet. Both sets of players observe a minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the Bradford stadium fire . Last week, when Wigan threw caution to the wind against Brighton they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it. And when McClean picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , Wigan\u2019s hopes left the field with him. Both these teams can still get what they want out of this season. But only just. And next Saturday will have to be really, truly remarkable if that is to happen.",

The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday\u2019s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice . Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . \u2018I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. \u2018It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I\u2019ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,\u2019 Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. \u2018It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. \u2018I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. \u2018I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don\u2019t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.\u2019 Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role . That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. \u2018I am loving my job at the moment,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.\u2019 It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC\u2019s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship . Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket . Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen \u2014 says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He\u2019s only interested if there\u2019s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator \u2013 and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes \u2014 and 26 Test wins overall, a national record.

The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant in southern Tijuana following a tip-off from the disgusted client. The customer called in the cops after witnessing kitchen staff killing the dog, later intended to be served up masquerading as pork in the next chow mein. Scroll down for video . Disgusted: A restaurant customer in Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. Pictured is a dead dog police recovered at the establishment . The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since local police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant (pictured) in southern Tijuana . Officers conducting a raid of the restaurant on Wednesday morning discovered caged dogs in the kitchen, a decapitated puppy in the trash and the owner himself in the process of decapitating and butchering a canine carcass, putting the meat in a cooking pot. Owner Yu Yu Chou told local newspaper reporters: 'I admit to killing the dog, but the meat is for my own personal use, not for my customers.' Police received a tip-off from a restaurant client who heard the sounds of a howling dog at the back of the establishment. After peeking over the back fence to investigate, the horrified client witnessed two cooks in the act of killing the defenceless animal. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality . An official was filmed pulling a beheaded dog from a storage barrel during the raid . Boast:\u00a0The restaurant advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' but has had complaints from customers before about flies and cockroaches in their food . Rescued: Some dogs were found alive at the restaurant and were taken away by a local vet . Lucky: This dog was saved from the owner's knives by the police. The picture is a grab from a local news agency video of the property . Upon arrival at the scene, police officers said they witnessed the cooks hurriedly throw a decapitated dog carcass in a kitchen waste bin. Officers later saw the owner decapitating and butchering a dog in the back alley. The restaurant, which advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' claims never to have received complaints of using dog meat before. The owner, while handcuffed in the back of a police vehicle, said: 'We've had complaints from customers who have found hair, flies or cockroaches in their food, but never anything this serious.' The AFN news agency took video evidence of the police bust. It contains footage of a hair-strewn alley where the dogs were seen being butchered, a terrified dog chained to the wall and a forensics officer pulling a decapitated canine carcass \u2013 stiffened by rigor mortis \u2013 out of a kitchen waste bin. The animals, some of which survived, were removed from the scene in a veterinarian's van. Samples of meat were also taken from the kitchen fridges in order to determine the origin of the meat. Following local authorities' demands to investigate kitchens in other local oriental eating establishments, five other Chinese restaurants in the area did not open their doors to customers on Wednesday, leading many to question whether the cooking of dog meat has long been practiced in Tijuana. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality. A spokesman for the Mexican Ministry of Health told local reporters following the incident that the city would be pursuing conviction of the Mr Yu Yu Chou, and that 'you can't play with the health of Tijuana'. The infamous frontier town in Baja California state sits directly on the United States border, just three miles from downtown San Diego.

The three-night production was put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, of which Harry\u2019s sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, is patron. Indeed, Prince Harry even attended the opening night of his former girlfriend\u2019s play, and was heard laughing loudly throughout.

I suppose that helps.

        "text": "A cake-making prodigy is set to be the next Mary Berry as she prepares to publish her second cookbook. Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at the age of three and landed her first book deal with her recipe collection Amy's Baking Year at just 14. Her second, all about entertaining, is now firmly in the works but the teenager has her sights set even higher - with plans to launch her own baking products and even become a TV chef. Already baking at five years old Amy-Beth (left) is pictured with sister\u00a0Lara-Jayne, 10 . Amy-Beth started baking at three-years-old and published her first cookbook, Amy's Baking Year, at age 13 . Amy-Beth most recently hosted a cupcake-making class in Harrods, London. Britain's youngest published baker, who counts Pixie Lott and Katherine Jenkins among her fans, delighted a crowd with her recent demonstration. She then signed copies of her debut cookbook in the Toy Kingdom department for thrilled shoppers. Amy-Beth also has a regular column in OK! magazine and continues to supply other publications with tips and recipes. The keen cook, who attends Newhall School in Chelmsford full-time, makes bespoke baked goods to order in her spare time, during summer holidays and half term. But it seems the talented young baker gets it all from her mother Gillian, who taught Amy and her other daughter Lara-Jayne, 22, how to make cakes. Amy gets decorating as she shows onlookers how to perfect cupcakes at a London presentation . The young cook pictured with fans at her Harrods book signing and cupcake masterclass . Amy picked up a particular knack for baking and continued to experiment until she soon took full control of the kitchen and the entertaining. Gillian told MailOline: 'When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion, as I did when I was a child, in cooking and baking. 'She watched me cook all meals and bake birthday cakes for many members of our family from scratch. 'I always preferred to make my own cakes as I knew exactly what was going in them, they tasted nicer and they were (and still are) much appreciated. 'Amy soon wanted to venture out on her own and at aged 12 she asked if she could bake her sister Lara-Jayne's cake for her 17th birthday. 'I had planned a simple chocolate sponge cake but Amy, being more adventurous, single-handedly created a two-tiered cake covered in roll-out fondant icing. 'She then decorated it with heart shaped biscuits on sticks, which later became a recipe in her book (lollipop biscuits). 'She has quite literally surpassed me in the kitchen, a fact that I'm both proud and amazed at. 'It is sometimes hard to get into the kitchen now as Amy is often experimenting with recipes, baking for charity cake sales, or helping preparing for a party or event we are organising.' Her inventive bakes are remarkable for her age. Amy designed and made a pony-themed cake for a teacher at age 12. At age 14 she was commissioned by another teacher to make a three-tiered lace effect wedding cake. She finally baked it in chocolate at age 16 using carrot, pineapple and lemon flavours. A mini oven at Christmas could certainly have helped ignite Amy's passion for cake making . When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion in cooking and baking . Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there. The teenager said: 'I made cupcakes for regular clients as well as celebrity functions and after parties and it grew from there. 'After having seven of my recipes published in a national newspaper weekend supplements, I approached a few publishers with a mock-up of the ideas I had for my book and got the book deal at age 14.' Her book, Amy's Baking Year, features recipes themed around the four seasons and occasions such as\u00a0for Mother's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother Gillian, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there . This catapulted Amy into the limelight of the baking world and opened up multiple doors for her . From cute cupcakes, French macarons, cookies, tarts and classic sponge cakes, to sticky puddings, jams and gingerbread - plus Amy's highly sought after 'perfect cupcake' recipe - there is an indulgent treat to suit every occasion. With a focus on family, the recipes are designed for both seasoned bakers and young enthusiasts. Amy's Baking Year features Amy's selected easy-to-follow recipes themed around the four seasons . The beautifully illustrated book also features tips on the perfect decoration and setting for each bake. She says: 'I have been brought up cooking and baking by my mum who is also a talented home cook and baker, as were her parents who both worked in catering.' A few of the recipes in the book such as my Grandad's Coconut Ice, and Aunty Lynn's Fudge have been passed down to Amy from members of her family. She continues:\u00a0'While I was at home experimenting with recipes my friends were spending their time on social media. 'It was something that I was passionate about so really enjoyed spending my time focusing on it. 'I think it's important that we return to traditional values and that what I try to get across through my cooking. 'The art of cooking and eating healthily is important to me, so I'm very conscious of the ingredients I cook with, but I think we're becoming too calorie obsessed. That being said I try not to eat everything I bake.' She is juggling her lucrative cooking career around studying for her A-levels in English literature, art and music. 'The school I attend doesn't offer cookery as an A Level. I hope to go on to train at Le Cordon Bleu in the future after I have finished school.' Amy says she hopes to have her next cookbook themed around entertaining on bookshelves nationwide by 2017.",

        "text": "If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming. Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding\u2019s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures. Millwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute\u00a0Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal . Lions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy\u00a0Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike . Martyn Waghorn was one of three players sent off - two for Wigan and one for Millwall in the fiesty clash . Millwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O\u2019Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory . Substitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher . Scorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3 . Booked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers . Sent off: Upson . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53) Substitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy . Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou\u2019s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men. Wigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall . Millwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer . The Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now. \u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019 And he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years. \u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that. \u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019 With Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up. \u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019 Wigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear. But overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd. Wigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams . Wigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented . Within the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner. And when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header. After Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

        "text": "Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, \"it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence\". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right)\u00a0branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it\u2019s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don\u2019t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged \u00a32 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of \"treating\" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.",

        "text": "Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating 'ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected 'presence' in the room. The spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it's only our mind playing tricks. The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain, the researchers say. Scroll down for video . The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. 'This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the\u00a0Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland . Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers. Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body. 'Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else,' said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL). The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements. These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one. They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer. Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body. The scientists then conducted an experiment to 'trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects. Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. 'We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing . 'And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. 'And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. 'So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment,' said Blanke. The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up 'sensorimotor' brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances. The study, published in Current Biology, said that 'simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia'. Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations. 'We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients.' Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'. The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours . Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab. 'A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state.' Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology.",

Aluel Manyang was\u00a0moved from the intensive care unit at the Royal Children's about 5.15pm on Friday, and greeted her distraught mother, Akon Goode, with a 'big hug', her father said. 'She didn't believe that her mum was still alive,' Joseph Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for videos . Aueel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode,\u00a0believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . Ms Guode visited her daughter for the first time but did not stay the night in the hospital. Mr Manyang said his daughter was expected to make a '100 per cent' recovery and she should be allowed to go home within four days. The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Aluel Manyang believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings -\u00a0one-year-old brother Bol and\u00a0four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed\u00a0her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang, says five-year-old Awel remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital but she remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said. 'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident\u00a0and remembers her children crying out. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday . Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash,\u00a0The Age\u00a0reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site\u00a0at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun.\u00a0'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said. The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children . The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning . The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008 . Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. A mini shrine for the three young children grew on Thursday as families visited the area to pay their respects . Two young girls carried flowers to the lake where three three died when the car they were in crashed . Victoria police said that the exact circumstances of how the car went into the lake are yet to be determined . A resident named Michelle told 3AW that her neighbour broke open the back windscreen of the 4WD to save the children . Victoria Ambulance said the children were taken to The Royal Children's hospital via air ambulance . Further tests will be conducted in order to determine whether the car had any mechanical defects .",

        "text": "A car salesman who was high on cocaine murdered a prostitute by stabbing her 44 times before raping two more women at his home while his partner enjoyed a Christmas night out. Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December. As she lay dead on the floor, the father-of-two called two more vice girls over to his family home and raped them before they managed to flee while still naked. His young son was asleep in the bedroom next door while he carried out the horrific crimes. Mathieson, who has previously been described as of 'impeccable character', pleaded guilty to murder and rape at the High Court in Glasgow today and now faces life in prison. Steven Mathieson, 38 (left), stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer, 23, (right) dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December, while his partner was on a night out . The court heard how the crimes occurred while he was left babysitting his young children while their mother - his partner of 10 years - enjoyed a night out. The family had spent the day Christmas shopping on December 4 last year and enjoyed a meal before returning home. Mathieson - described as being his 'normal self' - then dropped one of his children at his grandmother's home before returning to his house \u2013 in a quiet residential neighbourhood - with his younger son. His partner left the property for a work night out and he sent her a text which said: 'Have a good night. Love you'. However, soon after he had put their young son to bed, Mathieson used his phone to arrange for sex while his partner was out. The court heard he regularly used sex phone lines but hid it from his long-term partner. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was one of the escorts who arranged to meet him. The 23-year-old, who had arrived in Scotland just a few days earlier having moved up from London, arrived at his property at about 11pm. However, within minutes, Mathieson \u2013 who was high on cocaine - stabbed her 44 times and cut her throat. Mathieson then sent a text to his partner which said: 'Sorry xx'. His young child was asleep in the room next door while he carried out the harrowing crimes. The court heard how Ms Maurer had defensive-type injuries suggesting she had tried to fend off her killer. Two other escorts, who Mathieson had summoned, then arrived at his home, completely oblivious to the murder which had taken place. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was stabbed 44 times by\u00a0Mathieson and had her throat cut . When they arrived, they found Mathieson casually sitting on his sofa in the living room before he led them upstairs. Describing the horror that then met them, prosecutor Jane Farquharson said: 'Mathieson went into the bedroom first. 'He put on the light and hung back at the door whilst the women walked in. 'As soon as they entered the bedroom, they saw the deceased, lying on her back and on top of the double bed.' Mathieson then grabbed two knives from a set of drawers before blocking the door. One of the women begged Mathieson to let them go but he grabbed their mobile phones and flung them away, the court heard. He initially tormented them by stroking them with the knives before threatening to kill them if they did not follow his demands. Miss Farquharson: 'He told both to remove their clothing and to dance for him. 'In fear of what he might do and, with the body of the deceased lying on the bed in front of them, each did as they were told.' Mathieson went on to rape the pair, aged 26 and 22 - including attacking one after ordering her to lie beside Ms Maurer's dead body. The pair were trapped in the bedroom for 10 minutes before he ordered them downstairs. Once there, Mathieson continued to humiliate them before raping them again. Miss Farquharson said: 'Over the course of the assault in the living room, he told them that his son was asleep in the bedroom upstairs. 'He appeared to have an awareness of what he had done advising both: 'I'm going to be many years in prison because I killed that girl. 'I've done this to show my wife something.' Mathieson then went to a window thinking his partner had returned and, sensing an opportunity to escape, the women ran for the door. Mathieson tried to chase them, striking one on the leg with a knife, but they managed to escape and ran to a nearby flat where a woman came to their aid. Miss Farquharson: 'Both repeatedly stated their thanks and asked for help. They were crying and appeared to be terrified.' After the women escaped, Mathieson dialled 999 himself and told the operator: 'I've been high on drugs and I've killed a prostitute. 'Tell the officers I am not aggressive. I'm sitting on the couch. I had two other girls, but I've let them go.' Mathieson was still sitting in his living room when police turned up. He got down on his knees and held out his hands when officers arrested him. Mathieson, a car sales manager, carried out the horrific crimes at his home in\u00a0Falkirk,\u00a0Stirlingshire (above), while his partner went on a work night out. He is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and rape . His partner, clueless as to what had happened in her absence, arrived back at the family property at about 2am. She was described as being 'hysterical' upon learning what had happened. Mathieson, a sales manager, was remanded in custody at the hearing today and will return to the dock next month. His court appearance was briefly interrupted today after he began crying hysterically and loudly retching as if he was going to be sick. In what is rarely seen in court, his QC Donald Findlay left his own seat to sit beside Mathieson in the dock and speak to him briefly before the case continued. The court was given no reason for what caused him to carry out the horrific murder and rapes, but it is believed his drug problem may have been a factor. In the spring of last year, he had started attending Cocaine Anonymous having built up a large debt. His girlfriend was not aware of the drug habit until finding out about the cash he owed, the court heard. Mr Findlay, defending, said that before his crimes Mathieson had been of 'impeccable character', but said he now accepted 'full responsibility' for his actions. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentencing until May 7. Speaking after the hearing, detective inspector Dave Pinkney, from Police Scotland, said: 'The incidents that took place within the property in Springfield Drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults. 'Police responded quickly to the area and detained Mathieson almost immediately. 'Following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences. 'I would like to thank the victims and the family of Luciana Maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation. 'While nothing can undo the pain Steven Mathieson's actions have caused, they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence.'",

Rovers twice came came from behind, trailing 12-0 in the early stages to the Kingstone Press Championship heavyweights, before easing clear with five tries in the final 18 minutes. Amid a pulsating and sometimes controversial cup tie, the hosts ultimately had no answer to Italian international Mantellato, whose last three tries came within the space of seven decisive minutes. It was only the East Yorkshire side's second cup tie success since reaching the quarter-finals in 2011 and their first Challenge Cup victory at Bradford since 1926, albeit only the third time the clubs had met in the competition since then. Winger Josh Mantellato scored four tries and kicked 14 points for Hull KR against Bradford Bulls . Having forced several errors from the Super League side in the opening exchanges, it took a fired-up Bulls less than six minutes to go ahead as Adam O'Brien barged his way through and under the posts. Ryan Shaw converted on his way to a tally of five goals. The Bulls struck again when O'Brien and Etu Uaisele put Dale Ferguson over, although Shaw got a fortuitous bounce off the upright in adding the extras this time. Rovers bounced back, capitalising on an unforced error from Shaw to halve the early deficit when winger Mantellato dived over in the corner then converted his own try. Rovers lost forward Greg Burke to a clash of heads midway through the half but they levelled when an Albert Kelly cross-field kick was tapped back by Mantellato for Kris Welham to touchdown with Mantellato again stroking over the extras. A scintillating weaving solo run by Kelly gave the visitors the led for the first time and Mantellato's conversion sent the Robins in at half time with an 18-12 advantage. A minute before the interval the temperature was cranked up a notch when, out of the blue, Rovers Adam Walker launched a blatant punch at O'Brien and was sin-binned, along with the Bulls Adam Sidlow, who also gained a yellow card after following in with his version of justice. Less than a minute into the second half the Bulls gave notice that they were not finished when Danny Addy completed a stirring break from Alex Mellor to score and Shaw levelled matters. The home joy was short-lived as Kieran Dixon broke clear, only to be stopped by a superb tackle from Uaisele, but Graeme Horne then strode through the regrouping defence to edge Rovers in front again. Mantellato's kick bounced back off of the upright and Bradford nearly responded when Uaisele crossed but the final pass was deemed forward. Sidlow and Addy went close and O'Brien was held up before the home crowd were up in arms again as Kevin Larroyer stole the ball from Addy in what looked to many like a two-man tackle and ran unopposed over 25 metres to score a controversial try. Still the Bulls were not finished as O'Brien put Lee Gaskell in for his 11th try of the season and Shaw closed the gap to just four points again. Three minutes later Lucas Walshaw crashed over after innovative work from Paul Clough, Addy and Gaskell and Shaw edged Bradford back in front. But three tries, all from Mantellato, in seven minutes finally quashed the brave Bulls' hopes of an upset. Controversy reined once more as Mantellato gave Rovers the lead again, amid vociferous calls for a forward pass, but there was no doubt when the Italian international raced away for his hat-trick after Shaw fatally allowed a bomb-kick to bounce. Mantellato struck once more before John Boudebza helped raise the half century for Rovers on the hooter.",

        "text": "The baggage handler who woke up from a nap inside the cargo hold of a flying plane did not realize until a piece of luggage fell on top of him. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 bound for Los Angeles was forced to return to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday when passengers heard banging and pleas for help coming from beneath the aircraft. Today, the unnamed Seattle Airport employee revealed he might have slept much longer if it hadn't been for the passengers' bags. He told ABC News: 'When the bags started moving and I heard the sound of the engine, I had to think fast about what to do for me to get out.' Scroll down for audio and video . Can you hear me now? This is the moment an Alaska Airlines baggage handler was pulled from the cargo hold after falling asleep. Earlier, the terrified man called 911 begging the dispatcher for help . Safe: This is the baggage handler who fell asleep aboard the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Los Angeles on Monday . In a desperate bid for help, he called 911 and spoke to a bemused operator for 44 seconds before he was cut off. 'It was nothing but pitch black and a loud noise,' the man told ABC. 'So I was scared, and I didn't know what was going on.' The employee of airline contractor Menzies Aviation had dozed off inside the plane at the end of his shift and woke 14 minutes into the flight. On Thursday, the trapped baggage handler's desperate 911 call was released, revealing the man's panic and terror. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane!' he tells he operator. The woman ostensibly struggles to grasp what's happening and asks for an explanation. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's moving in the air,' he replies. The airport worker then rattles off the number of the flight and begs the dispatcher to call for help. 'Can you please, can somebody stop it?' he pleads. The man grows increasingly exasperated on the call, telling the woman on the other end of the line that he is not at the airport, but rather inside a flying plane. As he struggles to lay out his situation, the phone begins to cut out and eventually the call gets disconnected . The operator made an attempt to call the man back, but his phone was no longer in service. A passenger on board Flight 448 recorded video of the baggage handlder's knocking that passengers could hear inside the cabin . Emergency landing: The pilot turned back to Seattle 14 minutes into the flight when he heard screaming . Luckily for the drowsy airport staffer, he had better luck with passengers aboard Flight 448 who heard his banging and screams and alerted the crew. 'Help! Help! Help!' the man screamed, according to one traveler. The airline said in a news release the captain immediately returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and declared an emergency for priority landing. The cargo hold where the handler was trapped is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was not in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. 'At some point the\u00a0marshal\u00a0kind of made himself known and started banging back and he yelled really loud\u00a0and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something,'' Troi Ge, a passenger on board the flight, told\u00a0NBC News. Mr Ge, a sound designer from Burbank, recorded video aboard the plane in which passengers could hear the banging from the cargo hold. After the plane landed, a ramp agent was found inside the front cargo hold. Video taken by\u00a0KIRO 7 showed the worker calmly walking out of the cargo hold and putting on a high visibility jacket. He stood talking to airport staff for a few seconds before walking off towards the terminal. 'Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep,' the airline said. The worker, an employee of Menzies Aviation, walked off the plane and appeared well, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution. He was released home after passing a drug test. The worker, who was part of a four-person crew, started his shift at 5am Monday morning and was scheduled to finish work at 2.30pm, according to the airline. After the team was done loading all the luggage onto the plane, the leader of the crew noticed that one of his staffers was nowhere to be found. He tried calling and texting him but the man did not respond, leading his supervisor to believe that he had gone home at the end of the shift, reported KOMO News.

And now Airbus is set to introduce an extra seat to each row of its Airbus A380 model, squeezing yet more passengers onto each plane. From 2017 there will be 11 seats incorporated into the same space as the current 10 are placed, and  a fourth class introduced in response to the new dreaded middle seat. Scroll down for video . Tight squeeze! Airbus are set to cram an extra seat into their Airbus 380 in the middle section. The change is due to come into place in 2017 . The configuration was rejected by Emirates but two manufacturers, Zodiac and Geven, have agreed to deliver the seats . The addition of the centre seat will change the current configuration from 3-4-3 to become a 3-5-3 set up. At the moment the company uses First, Business and Economy class, but there will soon be the addition of 'budget economy', cleverly branded as Choice Economy. Some critics have gone as far as calling the new set-up 'economy minus'. Senior Vice President of Marketing for Airbus Christopher Emerson, told trade publication\u00a0Leeham News and Comment: 'Ninety\u00a0per cent of world travellers are economy but not all are homogeneous. 'We want to give a choice to the 90 per cent of the economy passengers. They are going to be the driver of the growth, the doubling of growth in the next 15 years.' Miraculously the inclusion of an additional seat will not alter the seat width for economy ticket holders. Currently the width is 18in, which falls in line with the aircraft manufacturer's manifesto 18 months ago to adopt that size as an industry standard. Airbus claims a rearrange of the cabin has enabled it to maintain this width and squeeze in the extra seat. The width of the arm rest, however, will change, with the aircraft adopting a slimmer version. The launch was announced in Hamburg this week, despite customer Emirates Airlines confirming it would not pursue the new arrangement for its aircraft - reportedly over fears the new design could affect its reputation for quality economy seating, according to trade publication Aviation Week. Airbus Vice President-Cabin Innovation and Design Ingo Wuggetzer said at the Aircraft Interiors Expo that more innovation should be going into economy cabins. 'In the past most innovation went into premium products, but that is only for six per cent of the travellers,' he said. The Airbus A380 will be advertised as having 544 seats instead of 525, and Emerson said the additional revenue per aircraft would be $20m per year. 'That's the equivalent of 40 per cent fuel burn reduction,' he explained. How the other half live! Rich fliers can enjoy private three-room suite for a luxurious first-class experience . Luxury surroundings: The Airbus 380 cabin is one of the quietest and most spacious in the sky .",

Looking on course for a first victory in seven Championship games against the 10 men of Watford, they conceded an equaliser to Odion Ighalo that further undermines their promotion ambitions. Adlene Guedioura seized on hesitant defending by Craig Forsyth with 15 minutes to go to slip a weighted pass to his Watford team-mate, who poked the ball past Lee Grant to snatch an unlikely point. There was a seismic rally from the hosts, who ended the game camped in Watford\u2019s box, never mind half. The final act was Heurelho Gomes producing a fingertip save from Richard Keogh\u2019s header. Odion Ighalo celebrates after scoring Watford's equaliser to secure them a point at the iPro Stadium . Ighalo is joined by team-mate and captain Troy Deeney (right) after making the score 2-2 on Friday night . Darren Bent celebrates his goal from the penalty spot with Derby's mascot at the iPro Stadium . Derby County: Grant 6.5; Christie 4 (Lingard 46\u2019 6), Keogh 6.5, Shotton 6, Forsyth 5; Thorne 5 (Hendrick 29\u2019 6), Hughes 6.5, Bryson 6 (Martin 76\u2019 5); Ince 7.5, Russell 7, Bent 6.5 .

Gomes had earlier saved with his legs from Darren Bent. There was a goalline clearance. Chris Martin arrived for his first minutes in nearly two months. But it is only a point for Steve McClaren\u2019s side. Enough to lift them back into the play-off places having fallen out earlier on Good Friday following positive results for those around them. Only on goal difference however. Having played a man up for the entire second half, this was a big opportunity missed. It had seemed Tom Ince, fresh from pulling out of England\u2019s Under-21 side to concentrate on reigniting his stuttering career, had produced a goal of splendour that would do much the same for Derby\u2019s season. Ince picked up the ball in the 57th minute, danced round two Watford defenders and bent a finish into the far corner. At that stage Derby were set for a first victory since February 24. But Slavisa Jokanovic adjusted his team cleverly and Watford found a way through. Derby had begun the match as if the international break had been spent on a leash now removed. A fortnight to stew on poor form and a loosening grip on promotion ambition, here was an chance to illustrate there is life in the old dog yet. Tom Ince watches on as his strike flies into the bottom corner to put Derby 2-1 up against Watford . Ince (left), alongside team-mate Bent, celebrates putting Derby in the lead against their promotion rivals . Steve McClaren screams from the touchline as his Derby side look to strengthen their promotion charge . Just two points collected in six games and the for those around them earlier in the day meant Derby entered the contest outside the top six for the first time since September 27. Watford came into this game with a defeat ringing in their ears too, a 1-0 home reverse to Ipswich, but in pretty decent nick in general: five wins from the six before that. The atmosphere carried the appropriate edge for a match of this magnitude, both sets of fans vocal. It was the hosts who started with greater energy. Watford's Marco Motta saw red just before half-time when he brought down Johnny Russell in the  area . Bent slotted the penalty past\u00a0Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal to level the scores at 1-1 . The former England striker's penalty levelled the score at 1-1 just before the half-time break . In the 15th minute Bent had a close-range shot deflected wide and from the resulting corner a smart routine, involving Craig Bryson and George Thorne, saw Tom Ince released to the byline. His cutback found Bent but the striker\u2019s former Tottenham colleague Heurelho Gomes saved the finish superbly. Watford, starting with three forwards in Troy Deeney, Matej Vydra and Ighalo who have 48 Championship goals between them this season, carried a sizeable offensive threat. In the 23rd minute they went ahead. It was more sloppy defending from Derby, who have suffered from slackness at the back during their downturn. Cyrus Christie was twice at fault, first losing possession to Vydra when trying to dribble clear then driving his attempted clearance in the box straight into Ighalo. The ball popped to Vydra who lashed home a first-time finish for his fifth goal in seven games. Matej Vydra celebrates his goal - the first of the match - to put Watford in the lead away from home . Vydra (left) smiles to the crowd after putting Watford 1-0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches . Late in the game, there was a brutal clash of heads between Adlene Guedioura (left) and Ryan Shotton . Both players were sent flying and needed extensive treatment from their respective physios . Guedioura was impressive for Watford, and was named man of the match by Sky shortly after his injury . McClaren came down from his position in the stands unusually early to bark instructions and rearrange his side with George Thorne needing to come off injured on his return from a spell out. Jeff Hendrick was sent on and contributed to the equaliser, delivering a smart backheel that gave Ince space to thread a pass to Johnny Russell in the area. He took a touch and was brought down by Marco Motta. Referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot and, after consideration, produced the red card for denial of a goalscoring opportunity. This was welcome change for Derby fans who had seen their side suffer defeat Wolves last time out after a horrible officiating error. Bent stepped up and dispatched the penalty with clinical power, his eighth goal since arriving on loan from Aston Villa. McClaren replaced Christie with Jesse Lingard in a bold attacking move at the interval, in search of a crucial victory. But it was not to be. Bent swivels to shoot at Gomes in the Watford goal, but he puts it wide and misses the chance to score . Bent reacts to his missed chance, while Watford's Ben Watson (right) watches on with relief .

The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 A 'simple' funeral with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker now costs \u00a33, 590 . Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: \u2018More than half of UK households have less than \u00a33,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. \u2018We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.\u2019 The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A \u2018simple\u2019 funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of \u00a33,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost \u00a32,000 more. An average \u2018full works\u2019 funeral now costs \u00a35,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from \u00a3102 to \u00a3160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.",

Thousands of the 165ft towers line the land, spoiling scenes of beauty with a cat\u2019s cradle of high-voltage cables. But their days are numbered after a more elegant design was seen in action for the first time yesterday \u2013 complete with a pair of distinctive \u2018earrings\u2019. Scroll down for video . National Grid has revealed the UK's first new pylon for nearly 90 years. Called the T-pylon (artist's illustration shown) it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons. But it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts. It is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy purposes . National Grid is building a training line of the less obtrusive T-pylons at their Eakring training academy in Nottinghamshire. Britain's first pylon, erected in July 1928 near Edinburgh, was designed by architectural luminary Sir Reginald Blomfield, inspired by the Greek root of the word \u2018pylon\u2019 (meaning gateway of an Egyptian temple). The campaign against them - they were unloved even then - was run by Rudyard Kipling, John Maynard Keynes and Hilaire Belloc. Five years later, the biggest peacetime construction project seen in Britain, the connection of 122 power stations by 4,000 miles of cable, was completed. It marked the birth of the National Grid and was a major stoking of the nation\u2019s industrial engine and a vital asset during the Second World War. There are now more than 88,000 pylons in the UK, including 22,000 on National Grid\u2019s main transmission network in England and Wales. These stand some 50 metres high, weigh around 30 tonnes and carry up to 400,000 volts of electricity over thousands of kilometres to some of the most exposed, weather-beaten parts of Britain. Each T-pylon measures about 115ft (35 metres) tall - about a third shorter than the old pylons, which were about 165ft (50 metres) tall. The design is a T-shape, with two \u2018hanging baskets\u2019 either side holding the various wires and cables needed to transmit electricity. T-pylons were the winners of a 2011 design competition to develop a new pylon that could deal with changing sources of electricity - namely, greener sources such as wind and solar power. \u2018We\u2019ve been able to answer \"yes\" to the hundreds of questions that need to be asked before we can introduce a new type of pylon,\u2019 said David Wright, Director of Electricity Transmission Asset Management at National Grid. \u2018The training line has enabled us to learn so many lessons about how to manufacture and build the T-pylon. \u2018I\u2019m incredibly proud of the high standard of engineering that brought us to this point.\u2019 Despite being shorter, the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight. The simplistic design, composed mostly of just eight components, means new T-pylons can be erected in just a single day, rather than a whole week for older pylons. National Grid is building a training line of six T-pylons at their Eakring training academy in Nottinghamshire .

Maintenance is also easier, as engineers do not need to climb the pylons, but can simply work on them from an elevated platform. The new pylons won\u2019t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use; rather, the National Grid will use them separately. National Grid plans to use the first operational T-pylons with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. \u2018We developed the new type of pylon so that we could have a 21st century design to offer as we plan new transmission routes,\u2019 added Mr Wright. \u2018The T-pylon is not a replacement for the steel lattice pylon but it\u2019s a new option and in some landscapes its shorter height and sleeker appearance can offer real advantages.\u2019 The new pylons won\u2019t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use; rather, the National Grid will use them separately.

Residents from Fairdale,\u00a0an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could. But buildings in the settlement were virtually flattened when the vortex slammed into the area at around 7pm on Thursday night. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way. Geraldine M Schultz, 67, and Jacklyn K. Klosa, 69, were killed in her home by the storm, authorities announced, while around a dozen people were injured. This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating \u2014 its second strongest \u2014 with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement. The house cracked and collapsed around them, raining down debris and a dusting of what she described as 'muddy soot.' The family survived, and several police officers helped free her husband, who had been trapped nearly upside down between two collapsed walls. 'We're alive, we were spared. Our lives were saved,' she said. A destroyed house is seen in Fairdale is pictured on Friday, hours after a tornado ripped through the community .

        "text": "Kellie Maloney, pictured at Ukip's spring conference in February, now says that a vote for the party is 'wasted' Kellie Maloney has said that a vote for Ukip is a wasted vote. The celebrity former boxing promoter, formerly known as Frank, is one of the party's most famous former candidates. But she warned Ukip supporters should vote Tory to keep Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon out of power. She told Sky News: 'If we want to stop Labour and the SNP I think you\u2019ve got to vote Tory. A vote for Ukip would be quite wasted I believe. 'I know Ukip are not going to like hearing that, but if they\u2019re honest they would say the same things as well because they\u2019re not going to get enough seats to wield any power. 'I think they\u2019ll get four or five seats, maybe.' She praised Ukip leader Nigel Farage, adding: 'You can\u2019t knock him.' But she warned how other candidates have given the party a bad image. She said: 'There is free speech (in the party) but some of the stuff that comes out from some of the Ukip people. 'I mean no normal person in the street could accept that and I think that is their downfall. 'They could offer some great things to the British public had they sat down and done it right and they weeded out the bad and brought in more people through the ranks.' The former boxing promoter, who stood as the party's candidate for London Mayor in 2004, has just undergone a full gender re-assignment. Speaking about transgender people, she said: 'We are probably where the gay community was 25 years ago and we can learn a lot from them. 'But it would be nice to hear political parties speak up on civil rights and gender issues.' Mr Farage last night dismissed the criticism. He told Sky News: 'There is a fear about Labour and the SNP and that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking to you from Hartlepool because whats happened over the last couple of weeks is there is a strengthening in the Ukip polls and its all coming from Labour. 'So the way to stop Labour/SNP coalition is for Labour voters to switch and vote for Ukip.' When Miss Maloney was standing to London Mayor, she caused controversy by claiming there were 'too many gays' in Camden. She apologised for the homophobic remarks when she addressed Ukip's spring conference in February this year. The criticism is a blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who had hoped that Miss Maloney's backing would help to change the image of the party . Mr Farage will today campaign in Hartlepool, where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the North East at the election. The seat has been put on Ukip\u2019s list of top ten targets. Other seats outside of the south of England on the list are Great Grimsby, Boston & Skegness, Dudley North and Heywood & Middleton. Mr Farage last night said he believed Ukip could 'smash up' Labour's 'one-party state' in the North. In an article for MailOnline he said Mr Miliband's party 'simply do not understand' the impact mass immigration has had on people's lives. He accused shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna of calling Ukip racist because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Ukip\u2019s strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North. In 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place. The Hartlepool constituency has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974. In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour\u2019s Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage\u2019s hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as \u2018H'Angus the Monkey\u2019, Hartlepool United FC\u2019s mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, \u2018free bananas for schoolchildren\u2019. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.",

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.",

        "text": "Miami (CNN)Inside a plane at Miami International Airport, baggage handlers are going on a shopping spree with passengers' bags. What they don't know is that they are being recorded on a hidden camera. The Miami-Dade Police Department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. \"It's a problem we all face,\" said police Lt. Pete Estis. \"We will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease.\" Miami Aviation Director Emilio T. Gonz\u00e1lez said the insider theft cases \"are indeed the exception among the thousands of decent, hardworking employees at MIA, and they have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes.\" And these insider thefts just don't happen in Miami. A CNN analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the TSA from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables, mostly packed in checked luggage. The rest occurred at security checkpoints. Total property loss claimed: $2.5 million. John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage, followed by Los Angeles International, Orlando International and Miami International, according to the data. The problem has been so serious at JFK that in 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold. The camera showed baggage handlers stealing items on flights bound for Israel, including a $5,000 Seiko watch, iPhones, an iPad, cameras, gold rings and cash. Six of those arrested pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property or petty larceny and the seventh suspect's case was sealed, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. The high-profile case, though, didn't stop the thefts. Two more baggage handlers at JFK were arrested in 2014 after authorities said they stole two designer handbags from a suitcase, and then tried to sell them on eBay. Then, in December, seven more JFK baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage. The items were stolen from suitcases of passengers traveling to or from Hawaii, Japan, Johannesburg, London, Bangkok, Dubai, Milan and various U.S. cities. In Miami, which aggressively goes after luggage thieves, police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012, including six so far this year. Police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items. Another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way. \"Insider threat is very scary for us in law enforcement, and certainly someone taking somebody's cell phone, iPad, computer -- what's next?\" Estis said. A CNN investigation earlier this year found that Miami and Orlando are the only two major airports in the country that require employees to be screened through metal detectors. Miami even checks employees when they leave work to go into the main terminal. But that apparently hasn't stopped the luggage thieves. \"As far as being able to get the property off the airfield, that's a great question,\" Estis said. \"We have theories.\" In Los Angeles, police last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals. Among the valuables found were computers, watches, jewelry and cameras and designer bags. Sixteen airport workers were fired. \"We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,\" said Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport. Luggage theft could definitely lead to more serious problems, he said. \"I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism,\" Gannon said. Even the TSA has had problem employees. Since 2002, the agency has fired 513 officers for theft. It employs about 50,000 officers today, and last year screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry-ons. DA: Guns smuggled on planes by Delta employee 'egregious' security breach . Luggage theft isn't confined to airport workers. Outsiders have been caught on surveillance cameras stealing luggage from carousels. CNN contacted airports around the country and found while the total thefts from carousels are relatively low, it continues to be a problem. For example, Seattle reported 214 luggage thefts from carousels and other airport locations last year, 200 in Las Vegas, 36 in Atlanta, 35 in Phoenix, 15 at Ronald Reagan Washington National, 14 at Dulles International and 10 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

        "text": "Those\u00a0surprised at Yaya Toure's apparent desire to talk himself in to a transfer from Manchester City this week should not be. The Ivorian's CV tells the story of a player who has always placed pragmatism above sentiment when it comes to his choice of clubs. Toure, for example, left home as a teenager to play in the Belgian second division. Following that came some formative years playing for Metalurh Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. History also tells us that Toure, now almost 32, never stays in one place too long. Equally, though, Toure's rather clumsy statements of recent times should not be allowed to detract from his legacy at City and indeed in the Barclays Premier League. It looks likely Yaya Toure may leave Manchester City this summer but his legacy should be a positive one . Toure has struggled to impose himself upon games for City in the manner seen in previous seasons . Toure's time at City is defined as a success, bringing two Premier League titles to the Etihad . It looks extremely likely that he will leave England this summer. Toure has started to play and sound like an unhappy footballer, the social alliance he has formed with the Etihad's enfant terrible Samir Nasri hardly helping. If and when he does go, though, it is for his extraordinary contribution on the field \u2013 and not the unfortunate noise that has started to surround him - for which he should be remembered. At his club, Toure has been fundamental to City's transition from wealthy hopefuls to twice champions. Back in 2010, he arrived as a statement signing - a \u00a324m fee and \u00a31m a month \u2013 for a club determined to accelerate its own learning curve. It worked and, on a wider scale, he has simply been one of the most watchable footballers our league has ever seen in its modern form. I once asked a member of City's coaching staff if there was anybody quicker at the club than Micah Richards. He replied: 'Yes, Yaya. Not over the first few yards but when he gets going he is unstoppable. He's like a truck heading downhill without the brakes.' Premier League defenders would testify to that but there was always more to him. Toure possesses an intelligent football brain, the vision required of all top class central players and a sureness of touch. He has also had a demeanour that has allowed him the confidence to play just about anywhere on the field. This, remember, is a man who played as a central defender in a Champions League final against Manchester United. The first time he had ever played that position, he faced off with Cristiano Ronaldo as Barcelona won in Rome in 2009. 'We had a good team so it was not that hard for me that night,' Toure told this newspaper in December 2011. Toure (right) demonstrated his versatily by shackling Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2009 Champions League final . Midfield player Toure (left) signed for City for a fee of \u00a324million from Barcelona in 2010 . Mark Hughes, the then City boss, begun a plan to sign Kolo Toure in an attempt to entice Yaya along . In that same interview, Toure admitted that he liked to listen to Whitney Houston in his car on the way to training. 'That other music makes my head hurt,' he laughed. A detail that had been leaked rather mischievously by his brother Kolo, it pointed to a relationship that went straight to the heart of Toure's presence at the Etihad Stadium. Though he didn't arrive at City until five summers ago, City's pursuit of Toure had actually started eighteen months earlier in the January window of 2009. Stunned by a home FA Cup defeat to Nottingham Forest, City's then manager Mark Hughes presented the club's board with a list of transfer targets. Toure, then in his Barcelona pomp, was on it and so, cleverly, was his brother. The plan was straight forward. Sign Kolo and maybe Yaya would follow. The two brothers \u2013 as close as could be \u2013 had always wanted to play together domestically and Kolo's subsequent recruitment from Arsenal in the summer of 2009 was the trigger for the arrival of Yaya a year later. Sadly for Hughes, sacked at Christmas later that year, he wasn't around to see his plan come together. Nevertheless, Yaya's arrival remains one of the pivotal moments in the development of the modern Manchester City. The plan worked, with both Ivory Coast players gradually signing, but Hughes had been sacked by then . Toure (left) is a quiet figure away from the field and refuted reports of a fall-out with Mario Balotelli . Toure (centre) led City to the Premier League title 2012 and inspired an important victory at Newcastle . Away from the field, the lumbering Toure has always been a relatively gentle soul. When he ordered a 50inch TV from a store in South Manchester soon after his arrival in the area, he was immediately told by wife Gineba to return it. It was simply too big \u2013 she said \u2013 which was interesting given that on the same day she had taken delivery of a dressing table with Swarovski diamonds embedded in the drawer handles. When, in April 2012, Toure was accused in print of arguing with Mario Balotelli during half-time of a game against Sunderland he invited Sportsmail to talk to him. 'I love Mario,' he said. 'I am going to take him on holiday to Africa.' That trip never took place but on the field Toure fulfilled the promises he made when he arrived. A winning goal in an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 2011 was followed by another, against Stoke City, in the final. City were up and running and when Toure scored from 30 yards at Newcastle a year later, a first Premier League title was on its way. For a while, he was almost unstoppable. Toure (left) also led City to FA Cup glory in 2011 with a decisive goal against United in the semi-final . Toure also scored City's winning goal against Stoke City in the FA Cup final in 2011 . Toure delivered the trophies that he was brought in to do and will be missed at City when he departs . This season, Toure has not been at his best. He has, at times, looked his age. His manager Manuel Pellegrini hasn't always helped by asking him to play as part of a holding two in midfield when it has been apparent for a while that he is now most effective as a modern day number ten, free of defensive obligations. City still win lots of games when Toure starts, though. They will miss him when he goes. The footprints he leaves behind will be deep ones.",

One animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf, dismounting a rider, after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump that could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs. Shocking scene: Dozens of animal welfare complaints have been made after a horse attempted to jump a black Peugeot 206 car with glass still in the windscreen at the event in Greencastle, County Tyrone . Fall: One animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf, dismounting a rider, after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump which could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs . A number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event on March 28. One rider reported visiting A&E to be treated for badly bruised ligaments after her horse fell. One complaint sent to welfare officers warned that \u2018someone could have been killed\u2019 at the event. It said: \u2018The public were asked to attend a charity \u201chack\u201d which is supposed to be a casual walk; trot through road or forest trails with your horse with an odd natural fence to jump \u2013 i.e. trees or ditches. \u2018In reality some the horses were made jump extremely dangerous obstacles, one being a car with glass still within and over atrocious ground conditions which is nothing short of animal cruelty.' It added:\u00a0\u2018From these pictures some of these animals are clearly not fit enough to be partaking in any jumping activities, ridden by people who had no regard for the safety of them.\u2019 The complainant said a friend had attended the event, believing it would be in a good cause for charity, but was \u2018utterly shocked at what she witnessed, advising many horses were beaten\u2019. \u2018One particular horse left with the skin from his chest between his legs torn and hanging off,\u2019 they added. \u2018There was a flap of skin hanging down between the horse\u2019s legs.\u2019 Getting up:\u00a0A number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event in Northern Ireland . The Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said today that complaints had been made after the horses were \u2018exploited and abused\u2019 in the \u2018obviously dangerous\u2019 event. A spokesman told MailOnline: \u2018People have quite rightly felt the animals were being exploited and abused. Our point would be that the riders have the choice, but the horses don\u2019t.\u2019 Fermanagh and Omagh District Council - which has the power to prosecute, unlike the USCPA - said its animal welfare and agriculture officials are aware of the incident and are investigating. But Patricia Keenan, 34, who organised the event, said she had originally planned for the car to feature as a jump obstacle - but it was intended to be a 'photographic prop\u2019 on the day. She told the Ulster Herald: \u2018On the morning of the ride-out I had delegated a number of tasks, one of which was to close the pallets across the approach to the jump and hang a red flag on it. \u2018Unfortunately due to time constraints and confusion within the delegated voluntary assistants, this instruction was not executed, with the unfortunate consequence that a few riders out of the entire field of 65 riders elected of their own will to deviate from the designated clearly marked route which involved a modest jump over a ditch.\u2019 The charity supported by the race, Charis Cancer Care, said its trustees were not aware of the fundraiser - and would only comment on what had happened once it had investigated the matter.",

In his newly-released police interview obtained by\u00a0TMZ, Cle 'Bone' Sloan tells officers Knight uttered the threat then yanked on the gear stick. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to Sloan by ramming over them in his pick-up truck. Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records, has denied killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan in a parking lot in Compton on January 18. Scroll down for video . Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) told police Suge Knight (right) growled 'I'll kill you' before 'everything went black'. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to kill Sloan by running over them . Terry Carter (pictured) was killed, allegedly by Knight, in the Compton parking lot on January 18 . Sloan describes how the pair exchanged blows at the scene in January. 'He's mixing it up, he's f***ing with us and I caught him real good. Then he said, \"I'll kill you\". 'That's when everything when black.' Speaking to an LAPD officer, he claims Knight appeared to be reaching for a gun on the passenger seat while moving the gear stick. 'I don't if he was trying to put it in park or if he was trying to leave... I don't know. 'He started really reaching... when he said \"I'm gona kill you\", I thought \"oh sh** he's got a gun\". 'After that that's when everything kind of turned into a dream. I don't know what happened after that.' The audio release comes after pictures emerged of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries when he was arrested. Knight was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. The footage, which was played by the prosecutor for the first time, shows Suge Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of a burger stand in Compton on January 29 . Just seconds later, there is a confrontation between Knight Cle 'Bone' Sloan and Terry Carter. Knight runs over Sloan's leg and then plows into Carter . Sloan is then seen lying on the ground in the aftermath. A bystander then runs over to help . Los Angeles Superior Court also released an image of the truck the rap mogul was driving when he ran over the two men . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. The video shows Knight's pickup truck  pulling up to the driveway of the burger stand and Cle 'Bone' Sloan approaching the driver's side window. Sloan then approaches the driver's side window and punches the 49-year-old in response to a flurry of insults. Knight's pickup is seen backing up, throwing Sloan to the ground before the truck drives over his legs and then plows over Terry Carter - who died as a result. Among the other key pieces of evidence shown to the court were images of Knight taken immediately after his arrest. An hour-long interview with Sloan, who survived, describing what happened was also released. Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation in late January. Knight has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Knight was fleeing an ambush by Sloan and others when he hit the men outside a Compton burger stand. The entire incident took approximately 30 seconds. The video, shot by a surveillance camera monitoring the drive-thru at the burger stand, continues until the arrival of a paramedic. The footage is likely to be used by both sides during Knight's trial. Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, has said the video appears to show an associate of Sloan's taking a gun off of him after he is run over, and jurors likely will be shown an enhanced version of the video. Knight turned himself in to authorities the morning after the incident. Detectives took pictures of him to try to show he did not have any serious injuries from the attack. Sloan's interview with detectives will also be crucial to the case since he is unlikely to repeat the lucid account of the event and his own actions that he gave investigators. In court on Monday, Sloan repeatedly said he didn't remember the incident and refused to identify Knight as the person who injured him, saying he didn't want . Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan. The close ups were intended to show the injuries he sustained from being punched in the face during the confrontation . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen\u00a0ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation. The images show . Knight's attorney's say he was trying to flee and ambush. He is pictured on the night of his arrest .",

Starbucks announced late Friday night that a computer outage that affected registers at 8,000 stores in the US and Canada, prompting baristas to give away free drinks, has now been resolved. The global coffeehouse chain said in an update on its site that stores are expected to open for 'business as usual' Saturday. The company said earlier the outage affected 7,000 stores in the US and 1,000 in Canada. It did not explain exactly what caused the outage, which began in the early evening on the East Coast and in the late afternoon on the West Coast. Scroll down for video . No coffee here: A Starbucks store closes Friday in Phoenix because of computer issues. Starbucks says a sales register computer glitch has disrupted sales at company-operated stores in the US and Canada . It's free! A nationwide shutdown of Starbucks' computer system Friday evening prompted baristas to give away free coffee . Excited Twitter users spread the word about the giveaway, sharing photos of the free-of-charge drinks . Happy customer: User Joshua Decker praised the fine service at a Starbucks store in Redmond, Washington while posing with his free beverages . Store No. 1: There were plenty of satisfied customers at Starbucks' first-ever store in Seattle . The company offered free drinks and baked goods to customers before saying stores that had not already closed for the evening Friday were closing early. Earlier in the day, a young barrista named Jaleel working at a Starbucks coffeehouse on 8th Street in Manhattan told Daily Mail their system went down at around 7.30pm. The computer glitch prevented staff from accepting credit cards or ringing up sales, but Starbucks workers at the East Village location were still accepting cash. Some people who were standing in line at around 8.30pm had their wallets in hand. At one point, Jaleel walked up to a middle-age man waiting to get his coffee and let him know that their system was down and they were unable to take credit cards. In response, the customer flashed several folded banknotes. Starbucks released a statement on its website saying the company is aware of the point-of-sale register outage in the US and Canada. Greed is good: This giddy Starbucks patron took full advantage of Friday's one-of-a-kind giveaway . Get it while it's free: For some fans of the popular coffeehouse chain, the joy proved short-lived. According to Twitter users, many Starbucks locations around the country closed their doors so as not to give away free products during the shutdown . 'We are actively working to resolve the outage and our stores will remain open and continue to serve our customers,' the statement read. 'The outage was caused by a failure during a daily system refresh. We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience or confusion and will update this statement once systems are back online. This outage also affects our Evolution Fresh and Teavana stores.' Twitter immediately lit up with messages from giddy Starbucks customers spreading the word about the impromptu coffee giveaway and sharing photos of their free-of-charge Frappuccinos, venti mochas and soy lattes. 'Got myself a breakfast sandwich & iced tea at #Starbucks for free just now to be fair, I did pay for a drink earlier this afternoon,' boasted user Karen Chu, from Los Angeles. Another LA resident by the moniker @octopuscandy bragged: 'Starbucks systems are down so I got my drink for free. Seems like all Starbucks are doing this. Be sure to tip the barista!' Twitter user iamgrant quipped: 'Who wants to go to Starbucks with me tonight? I'll buy.' But for some fans of the popular coffeehouse chain, the joy proved short-lived. Fans of the global coffeehouse chain expressed their gratitude for Friday's freebies on social media . Seattle TV reporter Alison Morrow took this photo of a throng of tourists swarming the Pike Place Starbucks location . According to reports from around the country, many Starbucks locations in places like Florida, Tennessee and Arizona closed their doors so as not to give away free products during the shutdown.

Fellaini, who followed manager David Moyes to Old Trafford in the summer of 2013, is set for a more hostile reception than Juan Mata received at his old club Chelsea last weekend. The Belgium international became a symbol for the failure of the Moyes era but has turned his career around under Van Gaal and goes back to Merseyside as an established first-team player at United.

United are gearing up for a trip to Everton, and the game will be Fellaini's first return to his former club . Louis van Gaal has spoken to Fellaini about keeping his cool on his first return to Goodison Park . Asked about suggestions at Everton that Fellaini has a short fuse, Van Gaal said: \u2018I have spoken with Fellaini because I know this. Fellaini is always dry in his answers. He said \"it\u2019s a game\". Yes, but it\u2019s a special game for you. I hope the fans shall receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata because I like that very much. I hope it\u2019s like that. \u2018I am always communicating with my players about philosophy, performance, attitude, behaviour, and maybe one or two aspects more. 'That is what I\u2019m doing, not more than that. When players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities. 'Also Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let his qualities dominate in the team and that is what we are trying to do. I believe that we are doing that. That\u2019s why his performances are better just now.\u2019 United have confirmed that Rafael has been ruled out of the remaining five games of the season with a rib injury, and Van Gaal expects to be without Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind for the trip to Goodison after all four players missed the defeat at Chelsea.

Jones, Carrick and Rojo cannot play against Everton.\u2019 Robin van Persie is unlikely to regain his starting place despite playing for the Under 21s against Leicester earlier in the week.

        "text": "Nico Rosberg\u00a0is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career. Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock, he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton: \u2018I know exactly how he is functioning. I understand him really, really well. All his attitudes. I can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing. Sometimes he annoys me. Some character traits.\u2019 Go on, then, tell us what it is that gets under your skin. Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday . Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg\u00a0was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton . Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign . \u2018I don\u2019t want to give details,\u2019 says Rosberg, diplomatic to the core. At this point the door of the Mercedes hospitality area, in which Rosberg and I are sitting alone, opens fast and loudly. It is Hamilton invading the quiet of the interview. He turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut, his head down, and shouts in an almost childlike way: \u2018Phew, phew, man, it\u2019s hot,\u2019 deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke. \u2018You see...?\u2019 says Rosberg, his eyebrows arched. The daunting task he faces against his extraordinary team-mate was made vividly clear under the lights in qualifying for Sunday\u2019s Bahrain Grand Prix. Not only will he start behind Hamilton for the fourth consecutive race but behind the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, who is emerging as a putative title contender. ROSBERG'S CORNER . Keke Rosberg . The 1982 world champion attended pre-season testing with friends but rarely goes to races and does not give interviews. Nico said he got his father\u2019s advice before the last race in Abu Dhabi but he generally gives his son space. Vivian Rosberg . Nico\u2019s long-term girlfriend turned wife. She attends a few races, sometimes with a clutch of their long-standing friends, but is happy in the background. She works as an interior designer. Georg Nolte . A popular, mild-mannered former Bild sports journalist, who is Nico\u2019s PR and Man Friday. Tony Ross . Rosberg\u2019s race engineer. His attachment to Rosberg is such that he moved from Williams to Mercedes at the driver\u2019s request. HAMILTON'S CORNER . Anthony Hamilton . Father is rarely seen at races since being dropped as Lewis\u2019s manager but he is still the family patriarch. He established the business side of his son\u2019s career and still controls elements of it. Niki Lauda . The Mercedes chairman is strictly neutral but has a vested interest in Hamilton being successful, having brought him to the team after telling the board he was the driver who could win them the title. Daniel \u2018Spinz\u2019 Forrest . Hamilton\u2019s new travelling companion. A music producer, he looks after Hamilton\u2019s social media output. Peter Bonnington . Hamilton\u2019s race engineer. He did the same job for Michael Schumacher. Rosberg\u2019s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday. He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points. But even more separates them as people. Rosberg grew up the son of privilege. His father, Keke, was 1982 world champion. He was brought up in Monaco. He attended a smart international school there. He speaks five languages. But his life is the quiet life. Not for him the Hamilton whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in Los Angeles. He is not tattooed from chest to leg. While Hamilton courts fame, Rosberg\u2019s dream evening finishes with him and wife, Vivian, staying in to watch an \u2018educational documentary\u2019, their yellow Labrador, Bailey, at their side. Family is important. He has known Vivian, an interior designer, since his teenage years. They make smoothies or \u2018healthy\u2019 pancakes when they home in Monaco or Ibiza. They gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden. He relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch. He loves his classic car \u2014 a light blue Mercedes 280SL Pagoda, as perfect as the day it was made in 1970. He bought it without Vivian knowing, but they both enjoy it now. He drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern France. Rosberg has a trait rare among modern Formula One drivers: a hinterland. He turned down a place at Imperial College to become a full-time racing driver. If he wins the World Championship this year he will do so with a book under his arm. He is the driver who never stops learning. Having married last year, he and Vivian are expecting their first child in August, during the sport\u2019s summer break. \u2018Typical German precision,\u2019 he jokes. \u2018I\u2019m very excited and very lucky,\u2019 he says. \u2018I just hope it all goes well. There is a link between your personal life and your racing life, naturally.\u2019 But we know he is a nice, intelligent chap, more settled in life than his rival. The point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity \u2014 the skill and cutting edge \u2014 to beat such an extravagant talent as Hamilton, who eclipsed him last year. Rosberg has failed to match Hamilton this season, raising the question whether he will go the way of Mark Webber, who fell away after making his Red Bull team-mate Vettel fight him for his first title. Rosberg\u2019s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second in qualifying on Saturday . Jenson Button will start his 100th race for McLaren from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying. It was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure, the latest coming just four corners into his first lap. \u2018It was a power cut,\u2019 said Button. \u2018I don\u2019t know where it came from.' It is Rosberg who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later \u2014 and always turns up on time, unlike Hamilton \u2014 but genius sometimes makes its own rules. Raw talent is outstripping endeavour. As a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on Friday, he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in. He arrived after a brief stop in Dubai, relaxing and training, before heading to the track to face an inquisition. Why had he criticised Hamilton for slowing down seven days ago in China and thus imperilling Mercedes\u2019 one-two finish? Rosberg answered in a relaxed and courteous manner. \u2018Only today have there been millions of questions,\u2019 he tells me once the wider interrogation was over. \u2018Other than that I\u2019ve had some distance from it all. I don\u2019t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine. For both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic. Hamilton and Rosberg pose together during their unveiling as Mercedes' new team in February 2013 . \u2018Lewis and I are going through a difficult period. We cannot totally be friends. We go through ups and downs. We are only speaking when we need to but sometimes we have a laugh together. We have so much to do with each other. We karted together. We are here together. I am not an ice man, either. Things can get to me but I do not get angry. I am rational. You won\u2019t catch me getting very emotional.\u2019 The feud between the two has been running for a year, each upsetting the other in turn, a situation magnified because there has been nobody else with whom to scrap. If Ferrari seriously push their way into the championship contest, that might change somewhat. \u2018There are so many experiences that I can build on,\u2019 says Rosberg. \u2018Even now when he has taken quite a few points off me and been on a winning streak, I think back to last year when I had my best run after he had won four in a row. Nico's father Keke (left) was also a famous racing driver and won the\u00a01982 Formula One World Championship . \u2018I like to push myself. I am not at my peak as a driver, though I am probably close to it. But I have the experience of how to set up the car and deal with the whole world of Formula One. The intra-team stuff, personal relations are helped by last year. It was so valuable.\u2019 Rosberg was born 29 years ago in Wiesbaden, Germany to a German mother, Sina, and his famous Finnish father. He soon moved to Monaco and developed as European polyglot. His solid family background is the bedrock of his life. Hamilton said last year that Rosberg was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds, the former being from a council estate in Stevenage and the latter from a plutocrat\u2019s playground. Fair? \u2018I had it easy if you think of people who have money struggles in their lives. People reading this may think I had it easy. But I had my personal battles. Even making it to Formula One was not easy; it was a constant challenge and commitment. My whole life has taken a lot of sacrifice. \u2018Some people say I am not strong enough to beat Lewis but I have as much belief as ever. I only wouldn\u2019t believe I could beat him if I got to the end of the championship and I had lost. That is not what I want to happen and I am constantly learning to make sure it\u2019s not what happens.\u2019 Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel pipped Rosberg to second in qualifying on Saturday .",

Irving made five three-pointers and Kevin Love, another post-season rookie, had 19 points and 12 rebounds. It was Cleveland's first home playoff game since May 11, 2010, when the Celtics won Game 5 and James left the floor to some boos from Cavaliers fans. He departed for Miami two months later, but he's home now, all is forgiven and Cleveland are aiming to end a championship drought dating to 1964. Kyrie Irving\u00a0scored 30 points in his playoff debut as Cleveland Cavaliers beat Boston Celtics\u00a0113-100 . LeBron James (left) chipped in with 20 points as the Cavs took a 1-0 lead in their best of seven-game series . Isaiah Thomas scored 22 points to lead the seventh-seeded Celtics. They will try to even the best-of-seven series in Game 2 on Tuesday night. Clippers point guard Chris Paul scored 32 points, and Blake Griffin added 26 points and 12 rebounds, as Los Angeles surged in the second half to beat the San Antonio Spurs 107-92 in their first-round playoff series opener. Jamal Crawford added 17 points for the Clippers, who met the defending NBA champions' challenge in a difficult post-season-opening match-up of two powers. Griffin threw down his usual array of roof-raising dunks, while Paul quarter-backed Los Angeles to an 18-point lead in the third quarter. Kawhi Leonard scored 18 points for the Spurs, who had won the opening game in their previous 11 playoff series. Tim Duncan had 11 points and 11 rebounds, but the Spurs couldn't rally from their hefty second-half deficit. Game 2 is on Wednesday night. Los Angeles Clippers' point guard Chris Paul (left) scored 32 points as they beat San Antonio Spurs . Blake Griffin (centre) added 26 points and 12 rebounds for the Clippers in their 102-97 win .

The Hawks led nearly the entire game and pushed the margin as high as 16 points, but the Nets kept coming back. Finally, Jeff Teague dropped in a floater coming off the left wing, giving Atlanta a 95-89 lead. Joe Johnson missed a 3-pointer from the corner for Brooklyn, and Teague made a pair of free throws with just under a minute remaining to essentially seal it. Teague and DeMarre Carroll scored 17 points apiece. Game 2 is Wednesday night in Atlanta. Kyle Korver scored 21 points as Atlanta Hawks defeated Brooklyn Nets 99-92 on Sunday evening .

        "text": "Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T. Despite his newest models being nearly 90 years old, the businessman, from Buckinghamshire, is selling one every week, including to the TV and film industry who have used then in shows such as Downton Abbey. Mr Tuckett says his customers love the Model T - the first affordable mass-produced car - because they don't require need road tax or an MOT and are cheaper to maintain than a modern car, with each one selling for  around \u00a310,000. Scroll down for video . Toot:\u00a0Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett (pictured) has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T . Top of the range: This 1914 model is \u00a324,750 and is one of around one a week sold by the Buckinghamshire dealer . Yours for \u00a313,500: this 1917 Model T is on the market and like all the classic cars they don't require road tax or a MOT . Back to basics: Some of the vehicles need to have their headlamps lit by match, left, and right are the rudimentary pedals for braking, accelerating and changing gear . But with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast and some of his pre-1915 model have gas headlights still lit by a match. Mr Tuckett, 58, has customers who use them as wedding cars and even one that is used as a hearse. He discovered his passion for the model when he got a call from his great uncle, John Brazil, asking him to accompany him on the London to Brighton commercial run - an event for historic commercial vehicles. He had a Model T van, previously used for transporting sausages and pies to London, and Neil had driven it once in a field before he got behind the wheel in Hyde Park for the event. He continued maintaining the vehicle afterwards and his great uncle left the van to him when he died. The agricultural engineer started his own business in 1984 but when the work dried up a few years later, his team turned their attention to Model Ts.. Now they struggle to keep up with the demand at his garage in North Marston, Buckinghamshire, and sell the cars for around \u00a310,000 each. Neil has about six himself and goes touring in them with other fans of the car. MODEL T . Made . 1908-1927 . Price (from) \u00a3125 .

Neil said: 'We're a niche market specialist and I've got about 100 years of man experience of Model Ts with my team. 'We do about one a week, 50 a year. They're coming in here as fast as I can fix them. There's about 3,000 in the UK and we look after a good proportion of those. 'It was a very popular car. At one point, half the cars in the world were Model Ts. They're affordable, usable and repairable, even though they are 100 years old. 'It's more leisurely than a modern car. Its cruising speed is 30mph, at 40mph you're starting to rattle and to hit 45mph you'd have to be going downhill with the wind behind you. 'But it's cheaper to maintain than a modern car. The insurance costs about \u00a350 a year, you don't need road tax or an MOT and there are no major expenses. Alternative forecourt:\u00a0Business is booming at Neil Tuckett's time warp garage in the heart of rural Buckinghamshire . Meticulous: Mr Tuckett sources his Ford spares from all over the globe and carefully puts the machines back together again. Behind the wheel: The second-hand car dealer says that beauty of the Model is how simple and enjoyable it is to drive . Sales pitch: Mr Tuckett says: 'They're like a giant meccano set really, and so beautifully simple and reliable they just won't let you down. You also don't require road tax or and MOT' 'There's probably 20 companies in the world making new parts for the Model T and about 80 per cent of Model Ts are new parts now, but they don't make new chassis. 'The main source of original parts is America, 14million were built there. The parts are all affordable and there's no electrics so little to go wrong. 'And everyone seems to remember them, they know what a Model T is. That's quite surprising after 100 years, it's an iconic car. 'They're lots of fun. I'm about to go to Scotland with a Model T4 group - there's ten of us touring for a week in the Outer Hebrides. 'I've seen a lot of the UK that I would never have seen if I wasn't driving an old car.' Thing of beauty: The Model T is an icon, but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast . Germans may have invented the petrol engine, but it was Henry Ford, a Michigan-Irish farmer used his genius to realise its social potential. Ford said he had to invent his \u2018gasoline buggy\u2019 to escape the crushing boredom of his own life on the farm in the United States. The Model T was made from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable car. In total more than 15million were made. The first Model Ts were fairly expensive, about \u00a3500. But by the early 1920s, when millions were being produced, the price had dropped to about \u00a3125, which was roughly equivalent to the average annual wage. Ford was obsessed with efficiency: his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of Chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the United states . His famous decree that customers could choose \u2018any colour so long as it is black\u2019 was not to limit consumer choice, but to reduce costs. In Ford\u2019s day, freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry. Black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper. By 1914, a Model T could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the Sears Roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves.",

        "text": "Between the bad behaviour and the bad advice, Raheem Sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now. Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool\u2019s offer of close to \u00a3100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world\u2019s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the \u00a340million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with \u00a340million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo \u2014 Gareth Bale even \u2014 requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool\u2019s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide \u2014 unlike Tottenham\u2019s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player\u2019s agent for his role in the England international\u2019s ongoing contract saga \u2014 and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers\u2019 criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present \u2013 including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal\u2019s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as \u2018Uncle Aidy\u2019. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has \u2018more kids than caps\u2019 when he admits to one daughter \u2014 he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training \u2014 but denies a second child. But Sterling\u2019s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. \u2018As a young kid I had anger issues,\u2019 Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up \u2018in prison\u2019 if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was \u2018amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker\u2019. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling\u2019s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose \u2018mentality\u2019 was \u2018his strongest attribute\u2019. He also described him as \u2018a coach\u2019s dream\u2019. Gallen also praised Sterling\u2019s mother \u2014 Nadine is a nurse \u2014 for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his \u2018house parents\u2019. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling\u2019s value to Liverpool is earning roughly \u00a36m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; \u00a335,000-a-week compared with \u00a3150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling\u2019s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of \u00a3100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club\u2019s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song \u2018from the Kop\u2019. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his \u2018agent is a ****\u2019. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don\u2019t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don\u2019t take the dispute into the public arena if it\u2019s not a pay rise you\u2019re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward\u2019s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a \u2018beautiful house\u2019 back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?",

        "text": "It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway, . But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night . Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback . Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern . Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto . Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova . And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League .",
        "generated": "Manchester United was unable to sign Thiago Alcantara due to various reasons, including a lack of interest from former manager David Moyes and Bayern Munich's need for the midfielder. Moyes was not a big fan of the transfer and saw it as not the right fit for United, which may have been an early indication of his departure from the club. Despite United's need for passing quality from deep midfield, they were unable to acquire Thiago until Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera stepped up their performances. Thiago's passing display in Bayern's recent victory over Porto has shown what United has been missing. Thiago's ability to dictate a game from deep is elevating him to the level of players like Gary Neville, Andrea Pirlo, and Xavi.",

        "text": "Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.'

An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.",

        "text": "David Luiz should not play in central defence again after his horror show in PSG's 3-1 defeat against Barcelona, according to former England boss Glenn Hoddle. The ex-Chelsea defender came off the bench in Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by Luis Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's two goals. Luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but Hoddle, who insists that the Brazilian has always been a defensive liability, believes he still showed his naivety even if he wasn't fully fit. Luis Suarez puts the ball through David Luiz's legs on his way to scoring his second goal of the night . Luiz suffered the same fate when Suarez weaved his way into the box for Barcelona's second goal . The Brazilian was left with his head in his hands after allowing Suarez a clean run at goal . Asked about Luiz's defending for Barcelona's third goal, the Sky Sports pundit said: 'Even if you're not 100 per cent fit you can't show that lack of intent. 'He's the last man on the pitch when Suarez picks the ball up and starts running at him. He realises he's the last man and the very last thing (you should do) when you're last man is jump in. You bide time for your team to get around you. 'He does what an eight year old who hasn't been coached does. He tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he can't move anywhere. Suarez nutmegs him again.' Some of Luiz's best performances for PSG - and former club Chelsea - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility, something Hoddle believes manager Laurent Blanc should consider from now on. Sky Sports pundit Glenn Hoddle described Luiz as a 'liability at the back' after PSG's defeat . Luiz defended like an 'eight-year-old who hasn't been coached' in this challenge, according to Hoddle . Suarez tucks home the first of his two goals against PSG after nutmegging Luiz with ease . He added: 'For me he's a liability at the back. He always has been. You have to find a place (for him) in midfield or even at right back. 'He's a footballer who likes to play in the playground when there's no shape to the game. He's a talent but that's not what top football is about.' However Hoddle's fellow pundit, former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, was quick to point the blame in the direction of Blanc, who chose to introduce the 25-year-old after an injury to Thiago Silva. Henry said: 'If David Luiz wasn't fit enough to start the game, why does he come on as a sub after 21 minutes? Luiz looks dejected after contributing to his side's 3-1 defeat in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . Jamie Redknapp also admitted that Luiz can be a liability but Thierry Henry questioned the player's fitness . 'From a coaching point of view, why would you put him in? If he's not fit enough to start, why do you put him in?' Sportsmail\u00a0columnist Jamie Redknapp, who was also in the Sky Sports studio, showed some sympathy for Luiz but pointed towards the sheer number of high-profile errors made by the former Benfica man in recent seasons. Responding to Henry, Redknapp said: 'I do agree with you but I've seen him do that every single week in the Premier League. 'That's one of the reasons Chelsea were quick to get rid of him. Defensively, at times, he's a liability.'",

The Brazilian suffered an injury 10 days ago and despite having not played a full match, he still showed his naivety according to the former England boss Glenn Hoddle. Hoddle believes that Luiz is a liability at the back and recommends that PSG's manager, Laurent Blanc, should consider playing him in a less defensive role such as central midfield or even at right back. However, other pundits such as Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp disagree with Hoddle, and both believe that Luiz can be a liability but that he has the potential to be a talented player.",

Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons . Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over. The pair seemed to exchange words and former NRL star Tong responded by appearing to headbutt Cudjoe right in front of referee Robert Hicks. Tong was sin-binned and Cudjoe got a verbal warning in the presence of Giants skipper Brough. Huddersfield took full advantage of the extra man by running in two quick tries, first from Ta'ai a minute later and then Scott Grix on 65 minutes. There was no further score, but Louis Anderson lost his temper late on as Huddersfield defensively shut the game down.",

        "text": "Concerns are growing over Russian ships that have docked in a once-secret  naval base in the Arctic. Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship \u2013 equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes \u2013 was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over \u00a3390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just \u00a33.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'.",

That was a pat on the back for his captain but also justification for Mourinho\u2019s faith in playing him. Terry is in a real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever. Part of his success comes from the way the team is set up in front of him. All of their good work means he is in prime position each time to make the telling tackle or interception. John Terry (left) was in inspiring form in the Chelsea defence as his side kept a clean sheet against Arsenal . Sportsmail's Martin Keown says the Blues skipper is enjoying some of the best football of his career . The 34-year-old defender's timing in the tackle has been impeccable for the majority this season . His decision-making is excellent and he waits for the perfect moment to get involved \u2014 there can be an element of gambling with that but it is a calculated risk. He was always able to anticipate where Arsenal wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it. As Chelsea have become harder to beat, Terry has come into his own. Following an entertaining first half, Arsenal's tempo appeared to drop after the half time break . GHOSTS OF MONACO? In the first half Arsenal played at a terrific tempo, especially down the left, but the whistle came at the perfect time for Chelsea. After the break Arsenal didn\u2019t move the ball quickly enough. They looked mindful of the Monaco game where they lost control but here there was not enough spark. Gunners striker Olivier Giroud had a frustrating afternoon against a rugged Chelsea defence . Danny Welbeck's pace through the middle could have instead caused the Chelsea back line a lot trouble . A MISSED OPPORTUNITY . I\u2019m a big fan of Olivier Giroud but Arsenal needed to ask a different question of the Chelsea defence. John Terry and Gary Cahill are built to deal with players like Giroud and everything was played in front of them. If Danny Welbeck had played through the middle, his pace could have unsettled Chelsea. It\u2019s much easier to be compact when there\u2019s no threat in behind. The Arsenal supporters were heard lamenting Chelsea's 'boring' performance at the Emirates Stadium . Despite many questioning Chelsea's tactics in the big games Jose Mourinho's team are in full control . JOSE IS ALWAYS THE BOSS . The Arsenal fans said it was boring but Chelsea are doing what they need to do to see out a championship. There is no problem with that. If anything that element of control is something Arsenal would do well to copy. Yes, there was no striker but could Didier Drogba really play three games in a row at 37? Jose just made good use of his squad. At the start of the season Chelsea played with so much expression it looked like the players were in charge. Now they look dogged, disciplined and firmly in control. There is no doubt as to who is the boss now.",

        "text": "Thierry Henry believes Arsenal need to sign four new players this summer if they are to challenge for the Premier League title next season. 'Arsenal need to buy four players, they need that spine,' the Frenchman told Sky Sports. 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I\u2019m afraid, they need a top, top-quality striker in order to win this league again.' Here, Sportsmail\u2019s Simon Jones analyses the possible options for Arsenal in key positions. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be looking to add to his squad ahead of the 2015-16 Premier League season . GOALKEEPERS . PETR CECH . Chelsea . Cost: \u00a310million . Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. Paris Saint-Germain remain the front-runners for his signature although Liverpool maintain hope too. The figures and Cech's age would normally act as a deterrent for the cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, Cech's experience could settle an often nervy defence and lift the performance levels of those around him. Petr Cech looks set to leave Chelsea after losing his No 1 spot to Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois . BERND LENO . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: \u00a312million . Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19. Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely imagine.' Bernd Leno pulls off a brilliant save during Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 Bundesliga draw against Cologne . MATTIA PERIN . Genoa . Cost: \u00a316million . Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City. Arsenal have been scouting 22-year-old Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin for the past three years . DEFENDERS . ALEKSANDAR DRAGOVIC . Dinamo Kiev . Cost: \u00a312million . Dragovic has been watched several times by Arsenal scouts. The Austria international is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and they are keen to strike a deal at the end of the season. Manchester United and West Ham have also watched Dragovic after first being alerted when he played for Basle alongside Fabian Schar. Arsenal though remain unsure Dragovic is for them. The Gunners have been keeping track of Aleksandar Dragovic but the Austrian is a target for Inter Milan . AYMEN ABDENNOUR . Monaco . Cost: \u00a310million . The 25-year-old Tunisia international has not long extended his contract until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal who have had scouts posted at most Monaco games throughout the season. They are well aware of Abdennour, who has over 30 international caps and has progressed from his time at Toulouse. He is left-sided, has good pace and can pass well. He also had the measure of Olivier Giroud at the Emirates in February. Newcastle and Tottenham have checked on him also. Aymen Abdennour has not long extended his Monaco deal until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal . HECTOR MORENO . Espanyol . Cost: \u00a38million . Arsenal scout Brian McDermott checked on Moreno last January as the Mexico international made his return to fitness from a broken leg he suffered last summer. They have maintained their interest in the 27-year-old who is highly rated by former coach Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. He is up for sale as Espanyol look to raise funds and has made 23 appearances since December. He was sent off in the derby against Barcelona at the weekend and could prove a cheaper back-up option. Hector Moreno (left) could be leaving Espanyol as the Spanish club look to raise funds this summer . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS . GEOFFREY KONDOGBIA . Monaco . Cost: \u00a320million . Arsenal are back on the trail of Kondogbia after he impressed against them in the Champions League. Liverpool have also watched the 22-year-old Frenchman but Wenger and Champions League football will strengthen Arsenal's hand if they choose to step up interest. Much depends how Francis Coquelin performs between now and the end of the season but Kondogbia is a player of great potential. Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia would give Arsene Wenger an alternative to Francis Coquelin . MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN . Southampton . Cost: \u00a330million . Like Lars Bender of Bayer Leverkusen and Moussa Sissoko at Newcastle, Schneiderlin is a player who has been long admired by Wenger. He is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked players to replace him should he go. Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Morgan Schneiderlin (centre) has long been admired by Wenger and looks set to leave Southampton . JAMES McCARTHY . Everton . Cost: \u00a330million . Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required. James McCarthy celebrates scoring Everton's opening goal against Manchester United on Sunday . CENTRE FORWARDS . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Atletico Madrid . Cost: \u00a320million . Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal an edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone has been strained. His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico. Mario Mandzukic seems intent on a move to England and Wenger wanted the striker last summer . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE . Lyon . Cost: \u00a325million . Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. He has 28 goals in 32 games, breaking club records, but has struggled against the top sides. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman. Alexandre Lacazette (right) has scored 28 goals in 32 games for Lyon so far this season . EDINSON CAVANI . Paris Saint-Germain . Cost: \u00a335million . Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year and Juventus are very keen. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was ready to join prior to David Moyes departing. PSG do not wish to sell though and Arsenal have been considering other options such as Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain, Mattia Destro at Roma and Palermo's Paulo Dybala, but he is keen to stay in Italy. Edinson Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris and has been linked to Arsenal .",

UEFA revealed that the Spanish manager had been disciplined because of an \u2018incident of a non-sporting nature\u2019, in a move likely to cause public outcry. The European governing body\u2019s disciplinary regulations read: \u2018A breach of these principles is committed by anyone who uses sporting events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature.\u2019 They are to review the case on May 21. On wearing the shirt, Guardiola said: \u2018Last week, the family has given me the T-shirt. I woke up this morning and knew that I would put it.\u2019 Lopez was a highly regarded journalist in South America and his passing drew huge outpouring from the very top of the game. Last year Atletico Madrid boss and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone tweeted that Lopez was \u2018not only a great journalist\u2019 but \u2018also a friend\u2019 after hearing of the news. Lionel Messi dedicated Argentina's World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old, who died in Sao Paolo . FIFA, Diego Simeone and Javier Mascherano have also paid tribute to Lopez (pictured with Alfredo de Stefano) Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was working for La Red Radio at the World Cup in Brazil, as well as Ole and Spanish publications AS and Sport. Married to Marca's Argentina correspondent, Veronica Brunatti, L\u00f3pez was well connected in Spain, where he arrived to follow the career of Javier Saviola in 2001. Saviola and Topo Lopez remained close friends and he was Ole's correspondent in Barcelona, a newspaper he had worked with since its launch. He had worked as a journalist for two decades, covering River Plate and Argentina for Ole while collaborating with Spanish daily Sport while spending time back in Buenos Aires. In 2010 he became AS's correspondent in Argentina was the journalist closest to Lionel Messi and the many of his team-mates. Lionel Messi also dedicated Argentina\u2019s World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old. \u2018Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge \u201cTopo\u201d Lopez,' wrote Messi after their penalties victory against Germany. 'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.' Earlier this month Javier Mascherano devoted the launch of his new book to Lopez, while he and Messi were both pictured holding placards with the message on late last year. So too did legend Diego Maradona. Both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have posed in front of a board during team photographs. FIFA also paid tribute to the journalist, with head of media Delia Fischer saying they 'would like to send our sincerest condolences to the family, colleagues and friends of Argentine journalist, Jorge Lopez'.

        "text": "Cleared: 53-year-old Graeme Finlay, a former naval serviceman . A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples \u2013 including Mr and Mrs Phillips \u2013 for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.' Innocent: The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm . Cruise: Finlay went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner (file photo) He described to the court how he swung his arms outwards from his face and felt them connect with Mr Phillips. The 'victims' insisted they had not argued with Finlay or ignored him at dinner and were subjected to a vicious assault as they headed to bed following a relaxing evening. Mrs Phillips briefly lost consciousness when she fell against a wall. In her evidence, she said: 'I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof (she swung a punching motion). 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him 'leave him alone you will kill him.' Finlay was later forced to leave the ship and make his own way home. He was interviewed by police and charged.",

        "text": "Police are considering manslaughter charges after a man who was violently shaken as a baby died as a result - two decades later. Liam Dawe, 21, was born a healthy child but suffered serious and on-going health complications ever since he was assaulted as a four week old. He died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault. Liam Dawe died at Derriford Hospital (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon, in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault . At an inquest into his death in Plymouth, coroner Ian Arrow said: 'On the balance of probability, Mr Dawe's health was compromised (by the assault) and he died earlier than expected.' A senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before. But Det Con Insp David Elliott said as Mr Dawe's injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force, fresh manslaughter charges could still be brought. The inquest heard that Liam, of Tavistock, Devon, was born an otherwise 'normal, healthy baby with no concerns' in 1993, but was shaken at just four weeks old. Police are considering manslaughter charges after Liam Dawe died two decades after being assaulted as a four week old . As a result of an injury to the brain, Mr Dawe developed severe cerebral palsy, epilepsy and visual impairment as well as learning, feeding and respiratory difficulties. He was admitted to Derriford Hospital on March 4 of last year with jaundice and later died on March 25 after his condition deteriorated following a laparotomy to treat an intra-abdominal sepsis. His GP Dr Jo Coldron said: 'There was no health concern at birth, but at four-weeks-old, Liam suffered from a non-accidental injury that led to learning difficulties, cerebral palsy muscle spasms, scoliosis, epilepsy, an unprotected airway and respiratory difficulties. 'On March 4, Liam was admitted to Derriford Hospital. He was slightly jaundiced but otherwise seemed well. 'He was later admitted to ICU, but there was no clear source for his abdominal sepsis. The 'year and a day rule' stated that an act was presumed not to have caused a person to die if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. The ancient rule, which applied to death and suicide, was abolished under the Law Reform Act 1996 amid medical advances. However, the permission of the Attorney General is still required for any prosecution where it is claimed that the death occurred more than three years after the act, or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death. 'On March 12, he was discharged by ICU onto the ward where his condition deteriorated before he died on March 25.' DCI Elliott attended the inquest to assess the assault Mr Dawe sustained as a baby to determine its significance in his death. He said: 'The question asked of us was if somebody would be prosecuted for manslaughter. 'The adult who assaulted Liam when he was four weeks old was convicted and sent to prison for 12 months imprisonment. 'Liam was shaken at four weeks old and his injuries resulted in ongoing health problems. 'The assault was a deliberate act and, at the time, the question was whether the adult intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 'In June 1996, there was a law change to the \"Year and a Day\" rule which stated an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. 'However, as the injuries were sustained in January 1993, the rule still stands.' Coroner Ian Arrow concluded the cause of Liam's death was 'intra-abdominal sepsis in an individual with severe cerebral palsy.'",
        "generated": "Liam Dawe, a 21-year-old man from Tavistock, Devon, died in March last year from intra-abdominal sepsis after developing cerebral palsy from an injury sustained when he was four weeks old. The cause of death was ruled to be accidental, but his injuries led to several health complications throughout his life. Police have now begun to consider manslaughter charges against the person who assaulted him, as new laws have been put in place that make it possible to prosecute for manslaughter if an injury occurred more than a year before the victim's death.",

Doctors are still trying to find out what the future holds for 17-year-old Natasha Willard after she was diagnosed with inflammation of the brain when she fell ill while studying for her A-levels in Cwmbran in Wales. Miss Willard's family are unsure how the teenager became ill so suddenly, just four days after she returned her feeling unwell. They are now trying to teach her to walk and talk again. Natasha Willard was studying for her A levels at college when she appeared to get the flu just before Christmas and her condition has worsened, leaving her unable to move her limbs and barely able to speak . Her stepmother Kirsty Willard said:\u00a0'The doctors are baffled, they do not know what happened. 'They have given her antibiotics and she is on steroids too. 'We are just left in limbo. The doctors have not said what the future holds; they cannot give us that information.' Natasha has been diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Natasha appeared fit and well days before she came home ill, and appeared to quickly go down hill . Mrs Willard said doctors have told them they are unsure whether she will make progress, but have warned the family she is unlikely to fully return to herself. Natasha, from Cwmbran, was studying art and Welsh in the sixth form at Torfaen's Llantarnam School when she fell ill. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, haemorrhaging, and memory loss. Encephalitis develops in reaction to a viral infection or when the body's own immune system attacks brain tissue. The condition can also be caused by the immune system reacting to a tumour. Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with encephalitis every year. Some people make a full recovery from the condition but others can be left with permanent damage to the brain and complications including memory loss and epilepsy. She came home on December 5 after a night out with friends and went straight to bed. Over the next few days Miss Willard started vomiting and had aches and pains, and her family presumed she had the flu. But on December 9 she collapsed and was mumbling and had to be taken to hospital. The teenager cannot remember the first four weeks of her illness and\u00a0 was unresponsive for the first three. She was then transferred from University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, to Rookwood Hospital, also in Cardiff, for intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy. 'She can say a few words,' said Mrs Willard. 'She can say \"Hi dad\" and \"Hi Kirsty.\" She can say her own name, and her brothers' names, her sister's name and she can say \"yeah.\"' Mrs Willard said they are having to teach the 17-year-old everything from scratch, as if she is a child again. But, she adds that she has not complained about her condition. Mrs Willard, who works in a bar, said they are worried about the reaction of people when the teenager is discharged from hospital. 'I would hate to think her friends would see her in a wheelchair and abandon her,' she said . Miss Willard (left) is pictured before her prom in 2014 and with her father Robert (right) before she became ill . Miss Willard's family have been told by doctors that they do not know if she will make a full recovery . November will be the teenager's 18th birthday and her family are hoping she will be able to come home. The family have been raising funds to pay for their hospital visits and have collected \u00a3700 packing bags in Cwmbran's Asda. 'We rely on lifts and buses,' Kirsty said. 'We don't want to put too much on our families. When we take the kids it costs \u00a317.10. 'Without the kids it is still \u00a38 each.'",

Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn\u2019t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as \u2018fuel\u2019 - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn\u2019t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn\u2019t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements.\u00a0Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. \u2018These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,\u2019 the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.",

        "text": "Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. \"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom. \"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\" Klitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can. \"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\" The 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya. \"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said. Klitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\" But after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring. \"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\" Watch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

The number of GPs from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the NHS tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two-thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the NHS is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.0 per cent of current GPs gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19.8 per cent in 2004 . But the figure is 71 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, east London, 63 per cent in Medway, Kent, and 58 per cent in North Lincolnshire. The NHS is facing a shortage because many GPs are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The Royal College of GPs estimates that the NHS will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The NHS employs 40,584 GPs, of whom 8,941 are from overseas. This is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association\u2019s GP committee, said: \u2018We need GPs from around the world to support the Health Service, and we simply don\u2019t train enough. \u2018We need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.\u2019 The figures do not state where the foreign GPs trained but separate data from the General Medical Council shows many are from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Earlier this year UKIP leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not be working on the NHS as they didn\u2019t speak good enough English . Earlier this year Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not work for the NHS because they lack good English. He said: \u2018Don\u2019t we want to live in a country where we speak the same language? And isn\u2019t it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country?\u2019 Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u2018The NHS \u2013 general practice included \u2013 is staffed by hardworking healthcare professionals from all over the world. 'We are very grateful for the work that doctors from overseas are doing.\u2019 The NHS should train more staff rather than spending \u00a32.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses, a think-tank has suggested. A larger pool of dependable permanent staff would also enhance workforce stability and patient safety, the cross-party Civitas said. The subsequent increase in competition for jobs would also help fill less desirable roles such as those in A&E departments and general practice. The think-tank said the typical charge for a consultant from an agency was \u00a31,760 a day, equivalent to a salary of \u00a3459,000. Because the salary of an NHS consultant was between \u00a375,249 and \u00a3101,451, four consultants could be employed for the price of one agency staff member.",

Corinna Skorpenske, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took to Facebook to publicly shame the anonymous note writer, while also defending her daughter Harley Jo, a student at Ohio State University, and her condition. 'My first reaction was anger,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'On top of everything she deals with she didn't need this. Harley is very strong, and many times she just lets it go. But because she is human I know she feels something.' Noted:\u00a0Harley Jo Skorpenske, who suffers from lupus, discovered this note on her car after stopping at a CVS in Cleveland, Ohio . Keeping up appearances: The disability caused by Harley's illness is not visible to others, but presents her with a battle every day . The harsh note, which was left on Harley\u2019s car, despite the fact that that her official handicap tag was clearly visible, read: \u00a0'You should be ashamed! When you take a handicap spot, an actual disabled person suffers. You were not raised as you should have been.' The person who wrote it evidently saw Harley walk into the pharmacy unaided, and assumed that she was lying about being disabled. In response to the note, Harley's mother Corinna wrote an open letter on Facebook, hoping it would eventually reach the person whose ignorance had so upset her daughter, and also aiming to raise awareness for non-visible 'ghost diseases' such as Harley's. Including a photo of the note lying on top of Harley's handicap tag, Corinna wrote in her post: 'To the person who left this on my daughter\u2019s car. You'd never know: Harley may struggle every day, but she continues to persevere, unbeknownst to many of those around her . Mom knows best: Corrina Skorpenske (pictured) hopes to find the writer of the note and change that person's - and others' - perceptions about 'ghost diseases' 'Wishing so much for you to have stopped and talked to this amazing person before leaving this. If you had, you would have known that my daughter has a disease.' Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its own tissue, leading to inflammation that results in visible swelling and joint pain. The disease affects women much more frequently than men and leaves suffers feeling extremely fatigued . The condition is also typified by a 'butterfly rash' which spreads across the face of many with the illness. There is no cure for lupus, but most of those afflicted are able to live a normal lifespan on medication. Corinna went on to explain in detail the laborious battle her daughter has been through since being diagnosed with lupus aged 16. 'It started with her joints swelling and the pain being so bad she could hardly walk,' Corinna said. 'But she continued going to school and keeping up with her community service.' The teenager went on to suffer a facial rash and hair loss - and had to attend her prom in a wig. She would go on to battle debilitating muscle pain, hearing loss, multiple lung collapses and a month-long stay in the hospital that forced her to postpone her studies. But, incredibly, the young lady always made it back - although 'not at 100 per cent' her mother explained. 'She struggles every day with permanent damage she has had to one side of her body and with hearing loss, but baby she keeps going!' gushed Corinna in the letter. 'I think you would love her': Harley's mother leapt to her daughter's (pictured) defense in an open letter, describing her as a fighter and an 'amazing person' 'I may not be a perfect parent, but I know I did good with her!' Corinna's letter is finished with a plea to the writer of the note, saying she hopes to find him or her: 'Not to tell you how wrong you were in leaving that note...but to give you the opportunity to meet My Girl. I think you would love her [sic].' 'People with ghost illnesses are often labeled as lazy or fakes,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'We never know what burdens people struggle with. Often we are so quick to judge or make assumptions, but if we just take the time to ask them, they are often very willing to educate them on it. Their pain and discomfort is real.'",

The man posed as a member of the congregation of St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester to carry out the crime. As well as taking one bag, he tried to steal the contents of two other elderly women's bags before fleeing. Police have released an e-fit and CCTV footage after a thief stole a pensioner's handbag from a church . The thief sat down in a pew next to the 86-year-old for the Good Friday service earlier this month. After grabbing the bag, he targeted an 82-year-old woman but she was alerted when she heard him rustling in her purse. As he fled the church, the thief tried to snatch the handbag from a third woman, also aged 86. But instinctively the woman pushed the thief away as he tried to pull the bag from her shoulder and he ran off. Police have described the incident on April 3 as 'appalling' and have released an e-fit image of the suspected offender. They are appealing to anyone who recognises him to come forward. The thief is described as being a white man, in his 40s of a medium build and wearing a grey hooded top. The incident happened at\u00a0St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester on April 3 . Det Con Dave Bennett of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The actions of this underhand and sneaky thief are so shocking that I have no doubt people who live in this area, particularly those who worship at this church, will be very angry. 'He used an important date in the religious calendar and within the sanctity of the church grounds to target elderly women who had simply gone to the church to mark Good Friday.' He added: 'Not only did he pinch one woman's bag, but he also tried to steal two other handbags and was only stopped in his tracks thanks to the vigilance of two of the women. 'It is a sinister, cowardly and disrespectful crime and we need to find the man responsible before he can target anyone else, whether they will elderly people or those attending at the church. 'We have released an accurate likeness of this offender and I would urge people to look very carefully at the image. If you recognise who this man is then please do the right thing and call us. 'Alternatively, I would urge people to be vigilant and if you think you see this man, then please call us straight away.'",

The SNP demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds - as the latest price of propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street in the event of a hung Parliament. Miss Sturgeon said the rising retirement age was particularly unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don\u2019t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country. Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. She is pictured at the Westerton Care Home during an election campaign visit in Glasgow . The SNP leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to \u2018at least\u2019 \u00a3160 a week. It is currently \u00a3113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing. Her comments will raise concerns that the SNP will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the UK which will benefit Scotland most. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to \u2018at least\u2019 \u00a3160 a week. It is currently \u00a3113 . Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: \u2018The Tory/Lib Dem government\u2019s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland\u2019s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. \u2018Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.\u2019 \u2018That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.\u2019 \u2018Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that \u2018the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised\u2019 if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least \u2018to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.\u2019 The SNP have demanded an end to \u2018austerity\u2019 and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: \u2018Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than \u00a312.5 billion. \u2018This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP\u2019s pocket \u2013 meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.\u2019 On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party\u2019s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to \u2018austerity\u2019 and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women\u2019s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year\u2019s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between \u00a310,000 and \u00a311,000 less.",

In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother\u2019s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica\u2019s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said \"it was just a rash\", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals \"my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness\". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, \"you're fat, you're ugly\", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said \"it was just a rash\". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how \"I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her\". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now\u2019. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .",

An architect who was wooing 35 woman online was cleared today of raping a blind date hours after they met. Adam Leheup, 34, had denied forcing himself on the 25-year-old telling the jury the woman 'freaked out' when he tried to comfort her about her saggy breasts. During the week long trial the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Leheup ignored her cries of 'no' and afterwards said:\u00a0'In my experience girls say no, but they don't mean it'. But following their deliberations a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court found the University of Greenwich graduate, a technical co-ordinator on the \u00a3500million Nine Elms Point Development not guilty of rape and sexual assault. The self-confessed first date addict had spent nearly a year on police bail before eventually being charged and appeared emotional, emitting a slight gasp, as he was cleared. Leheup told the jury they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. \u2018I noticed she had unusually saggy breasts, she seemed uncomfortable about that,' he told the jury. 'I tried to comfort her by kissing and touching them, then she freaked out.\u2019 He had fought back tears as he told jurors he never had sex with the young woman and didn't do anything she did not consent to. Leheup of Hersham, Surrey, revealed he was communicating with thirty-five woman at the time and regularly having sex with six of them, but stopped short with the complainant. 'She said: 'Stop' once and I turned to my side and started to go to sleep,' he told the jury. 'When girls have said nothing is going to happen, I've ended up having sex with them,' he added. The pair had met her just hours earlier on \u00a0July 9, 2013, after the pair chatted on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Leheup ended up returning to the woman's flat in the early hours of the morning after he missed his last train home. 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked,' the complainant told police, the court had heard. 'He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: 'No' a lot, but he was not listening.

The 13-year-old boy is said to have listed 25 names of teachers and pupils he intended to kill and had told classmates of his plans as recent as last week, but none had taken him seriously. The teenager reportedly walked into the school armed with a machete and crossbow around 9.15am this morning, killing a male teacher and injuring two students and two teachers. Scroll down for video . Distressed relatives of students wait outside the Barcelona high school where a 13-year-old boy allegedly shot and killed a teacher using a crossbow, and injuring four people . Students reunite with their families as others wait for news outside the high school in Barcelona as it is claimed that the teenage attacker had told classmates he was planning to 'kill all the teachers' Two young girls comfort each other as students and staff were allowed to leave the school this afternoon . The teenager is said to have launched the attack in his own classroom, targeting his female Catalan teacher and her daughter, also a student at the school, Spanish media reports. According to a witness, the boy had been late for class and shot and injured the female teacher in the face, before stabbing her 13-year-old daughter. Student Gemma Jarque said she and her classmates barricaded themselves into their classroom when they heard the attack. 'We were just starting the class and suddenly we heard screams... so we shut ourselves inside our classroom in order to be safe', she said. 'We saw the teacher lying on the floor in a pool of blood.' Another student, Paula Amayuelas, said the boy had been bullied before in school. She said he 'didn't have problems but he was kind of a loner .... Other students would pick on him.' The boy is undergoing a psychiatric examination will not face criminal charges because he is under 14, the age of criminal responsibility in Spain. The victim, a male substitute teacher, had come to the aid of the woman and her daughter after hearing their screams and was shot and killed as he attempted to protect them,\u00a0El Pais\u00a0reports. The week before the attack, the teen had told classmates 'several times', that he was going to kill all the teachers before committing suicide, but none took him seriously and wrote it off as a bad joke. The boy, only identified by his initials M.P.C., had also said it would be easy to carry out an attack in the school with 'good weapons.' Judicial staff members take out the body of a teacher allegedly killed by a student armed with a crossbow at the Instituto Joan Foster  in Barcelona, Spain . Horror: Emergency Service members accompany two women out of the Joan Fuster Institue in Barcelona as it emerged that the teenage attacker had a 'kill list' A visibly distressed man, believed to be a member of staff, is helped out of the school . Aftermath: Students and parents leave the Joan Fuster Institute in a bus in Barcelona while police hold the suspect in the school . Following his detention after the slaughter, the boy was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric examination, said Jose Miguel Company, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. 'He was very disturbed and saying strange and incoherent things,' said Company, who added that the examination is aimed at determining whether the boy has psychiatric problems or whether he was faking them. The knife and crossbow used in the attack are believed to belong to the boy's father, who is reported to have kept a collection of weapons at home. His sister, also a pupil at the school, is reported to have fainted when she discovered what had happened. A friend of the sister of the alleged killer, who has not been named, said: 'She is a lovely person but he did strange things.' The female teacher attacked only suffered superficial wounds and her daughter is being treated in hospital with minor injuries. Another victim, a 14-year-old boy, was stabbed in the chest, but is now in stable condition in hospital, El Pais reports. Barcelona police said the boy has been arrested but would not confirm the weapon used in the attack. The attack took place in the Sant Andreu neighborhood of the city just after 9am, and the boy was detained shortly afterwards. The regional Mosses d'Esquadra police force are understood to be holding him at his school this morning on the orders of a judge so he could be examined by experts. Attack: The 13-year-old boy reportedly burst into the school armed with a knife and crossbow, killing a male teacher and injuring four others . Shocking: The attack took place just after 9am this morning and police confirmed the boy has been detained . Although he was earlier reported to have fired an arrow at the injured female teacher, sources later said he used the tip of the crossbow to stab her in the head and a leg. The school caretaker is understood to have wrestled him to the ground and disarmed him. Mossos d'Esquadra said in a statement: 'We have identified a minor on suspicion of the death of a teacher at a school in Barcelona. 'The incident happened inside the school about 9.15am when the minor allegedly attacked the teacher with a sharp object. 'During the incident four people were slightly injured, two female teachers and two pupils. 'Three of them have been transferred to hospital and one of them, a female teacher, was treated at the scene. Police are investigating the incident.' The attack took place on the 16th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre when seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students and one teacher. The 1999 massacre in Columbine, Colorado, is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. A spokesman for regional police said it was too early to determine whether Monday's attack was an attempt to copy the Columbine attack.",

        "text": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Andrew Lesnie, the Oscar-winning cinematographer who spent more than a decade collaborating with director Peter Jackson on the six \"Lord of the Rings\"and \"Hobbit\" films, has died. He was 59. The Sydney native, who also worked with New Zealander Jackson on the remake of \"King Kong\" (2005) and \"The Lovely Bones\" (2009), suffered a heart attack Monday. Said a spokesman from the Australian Cinematographers Society: \"We have been advised of the sudden death of Andrew,\" adding that his family would provide an official statement later. Known for balancing technology with artistic considerations, Lesnie also shot \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (2011), directed by Rupert Wyatt. The cinematographer recently polished off The Water Diviner, the directorial debut of Russell Crowe, another New Zealand native. That movie opened Friday in U.S. theaters. Said Crowe on Twitter: \"Devastating news from home. The master of the light, genius Andrew Lesnie has passed on.\" Lesnie won his Oscar for his work on the first of the fabled \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001). His knack for getting the right feel of author J.R.R. Tolkien's most foreboding locales was remarkable. For the inaugural \"Lord of the Rings\" film, Jackson reached out to Lesnie after seeing his work on \"Babe\" (1995) and its 1998 sequel. Those Australian films, revolving around a pig and other animals, featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office. \"I'd never worked with him or even met him before, but he'd shot the Babe films and I thought they looked amazing, the way he'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect,\" Jackson said in a 2004 interview. \"And Babe had that larger-than-life feel about it that I wanted. \"So when we began looking for DPs in early 1999, I first decided to get either an Australian or New Zealand DP, as they'd be used to the way we make films,\" Jackson continued. \"Every country is slightly different in that way, and I immediately thought of Andrew. \" Lesnie's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film \"I Am Legend\" (2007), directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith; \"The Last Airbender\" (2010), from M. Night Shyamalan; and Healing (2014), helmed by Craig Monahan. He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie studied film and television at TAFE (a provider of vocational education) and at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corp. as a camera assistant. He honed his craft on low-budget short films and music videos and assisted on documentaries, features and commercials.

        "text": "David Cameron is trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview, Ed Miliband claimed today ahead of tonight's TV debates. The Prime Minister will be absent when Mr Miliband and four other party leaders take part in the televised showdown, after agreeing to just one direct confrontation with his rival in the race for Number 10. Mr Miliband accused the PM of 'ducking' the chance to defend his record in government or explain how he would pay for a host of tax giveaways and spending pledges. Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End in north London this morning . Mr Cameron has pledged to find \u00a37billion to pay for tax cuts for lower and middle earners, by lifting the point at which people start paying tax and the level when the 40p band kicks in. He has also promised to increase the NHS budget by \u00a38billion a year, while slashing welfare spending by \u00a312billion. Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. The BBC1 debate, hosted by David Dimbleby at 8pm tonight, is the second TV showdown of the campaign, following an ITV broadcast on April 2, also featuring Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, from which no clear winner emerged. Speaking on a campaign visit to north London, Mr Miliband said: 'David Cameron has chosen not to turn up tonight to defend his record. 'Here's what I believe - I think if you are applying for the job of prime minister, the very least the British people expect is for you to turn up to the job interview. 'What I'm going to be doing is setting out the big choice facing our country, between a Labour plan to have a recovery for working families across Britain or more of the same from a government that believes that as long as you look after the rich and powerful everyone else will be okay.' The Labour leader said David Cameron was trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview . Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood . Launching the Conservatives' Scottish manifesto in Glasgow, Mr Cameron denied dodging tonight's debate. Speaking alongside the Tory leader north of the border, Ruth Davidson, at the Emirates Arena, Mr Cameron insisted he had 'unblocked the logjam' that was preventing the events happening at all. 'Tonight's debate is part of the deal that was done to unblock the logjam that there was about TV debates,' Mr Cameron said. 'You are going to hear a lot of different politicians ... while you think they may be saying different things, they are all actually saying the same thing. Ed Miliband will spend the day cramming for tonight's debate after spending the morning campaigning near his home in London . 'They are saying abandon the plan that has turned this country around and got us more jobs, more livelihoods, and more business. That is the truth.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate. David Cameron took questions  with employees of telecommunications company O2 at their offices in Leeds - hundreds of miles away from tonight's TV debate in London . The Prime Minister insisted he was not trying to avoid Mr Miliband - and even claimed he had 'unblocked the log jam' stopping the debates taking place . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gestures as he stands in front of an image of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Prime Minister David Cameron at a campaign event in Cheadle . Responding to Mr Clegg's complaint of being excluded from the debate, a BBC spokesman said: 'Over many months the broadcasters, jointly, have worked hard to ensure that their audiences were offered the best possible combination of programmes to help them engage with the election, to inform them about the issues and to scrutinise the politicians. 'The programmes which have been agreed - including the BBC debate on the 16th - involved all sides, broadcasters and parties, making a number of compromises, allowing the different elements to go ahead. 'For each of the broadcasters, ensuring due impartiality is not only a priority, but an obligation and the BBC is satisfied that the election programmes it is offering on each of its services fulfils that obligation and that all the relevant parties will have the opportunity to put their case - and to be appropriately scrutinised.'",

A Dominican news report says the power couple spent part of their trip staying with sugar barons Alfy and Pepe Fanjul at Casa de Campo, a private Dominican resort they own. The news outlet Listin Diario reported on January 2 that Fanjul and the Clintons discussed Hillary's presidential ambitions during the visit. Casa de Campo, a luxurious retreat for the world's super wealthy elites, is also at the center of criminal allegations now dogging a Democratic U.S. senator. LAP OF LUXURY: The Casa de Campo resort services the upper crust of America's '1 per cent' super-rich, and both Sen. Bob Menendez and Bill and Hillary Clinton have holidayed there . SAME OLD BILL: This Instagram pic, deleted from a user's account on Thursday, shows former President Clinton cavorting among yougn socialites at Casa de Campo . INDICTED: NEw Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez (left) and his wealthy donor Dr. Salomon Melgen (right) are both accused of multiple federal crimes including bribery and honest services fraud . Federal prosecutors charged New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez with corruption on Wednesday in a 14-count indictment. He is accused of accepting money and trips from wealthy donor Dr Salomon Melgen in exchange for the influence of his office. Melgen flew Menendez and his guests on a private jet to stay at his Casa de Campo villa multiple times, free of charge, prosecutors say. The doctor is also now under federal indictment, accused of bribing Menendez with gifts and approximately $700,000 in political contributions. In exchange, the government says, Menendez helped Melgen's three girlfriends get travel visas to enter the U.S., interceded with Medicare authorities when he was accused of billing fraud, and helped lay the groundwork for a Melgen-controlled company to win a lucrative port security contract in the Dominican Republic. PRIVATE VILLAS: Melgen owns a house at Casa de Campo where he entertained Menendez on several occasions at his own expense . SUGAR BARONS: Pepe Fanjul (left) and Alfy Fanjul (right) own a congromerate that includes Domino Sugar and Florida Crystals, and they also own Casa de Campo. The brothers entertained the Clintons there in early January . Melgen's 70-year-old former secretary told The Miami Herald in 2013 that Melgen had also hosted Bill Clinton at his resort home in the past. And Melgen has contributed $8,600 to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the White House, according to public records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Weekly Standard\u00a0reported on Thursday that the Clintons spent the first part of their Dominican holiday three months ago at Punta Cana, a different resort area. They 'chose to spend their end-of-year vacation in the Dominican Republic's tourist hub Punta Cana,' according to Listin Diario, but on January 2 'shifted to the tourist center Casa de Campo' where they stayed with the Fanjuls. A federal government spending report describes $104,093 in payments for Secret Service lodging, but doesn't specify whether it covered rooms in one or two resort areas. FACING THE MUSIC: Dr. Melgen was in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday to face a judge for his criminal arraignment in the Senator Bob Menendez corruption case . ONE-PERCENTERS: Melgen and Fanjul have houses like this one at Casa de Campo; Bill Clinton has stayed with both of them . Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed at both resorts. The former president attended 'private dinners with friends at their Casa de Campo villas' and played golf, according to Casa de Campo Living. Alfy Fanjul also played a small part in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that dogged Clinton's 1990s presidency and resulted in his impeachment. Lewinsky told Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that on Presidents' Day in 1996, as Clinton was trying to break off their covert romance, Fanjul called the Oval Office. Confirmation of that phone call in White House records was one important detail that lent credibility to Lewinsky's claims that she had engaged in a series of intimate moments in the White House with the leader of the free world. WELCOME TO THE D.R.: Hillary and Bill Clinton stayed in the eastern Domonican Republic resort town of Punta Cana before shifting the vacation to Casa de Campo days later . FORE! The former president was photographed playing golf both at Punta Cana (shown) and at Casa de Campo . Security at Casa de Campo keeps out the general public. The only way onto the property for non-residents is to have a reservation at the hotel or at a home on the property. Casa de Campo itself is in La Romana province, on the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The Fanjuls own the sprawling 11-square-mile resort, along with the airport that services it. It's a luxury golf and sporting resort, according to the Menendez indictment, with a marina, three golf courses, three polo fields, equestrian facilities, a 245-acre shooting facility, spa, beaches and a hotel where rooms typically cost about $500 a night.",

His mother, Nicole Scott, said at the time: 'I think it's discouraging when you're telling a nine-year-old you're too good at something. 'The whole objective in life is to find something you're good at and stick with it. 'I'd rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner.' During a 2011 follow-up piece about Scott in the New Journal, his father Leroy also referenced the streets of New Haven and how some of them have 'fourteen-year-olds holding pistols'.

A grandmother of four told of her fury today after being fined more than \u00a3500 for dropping a cigarette butt. Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury\u2019s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground - before two council officers came \u2018sprinting\u2019 towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence. Miss Copeland was then issued with a \u00a350 fixed penalty notice following the incident in October last year, but refused to pay it within ten days in protest at how she was treated. However, after failing to pay, she eventually received a letter ordering her to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates\u2019 Court on March 17. She was then fined \u00a3304 by magistrates who also ordered her to pay \u00a3200 court costs. Miss Copeland was unable to attend the hearing because she had to look after her son Chez, 17, who has autism, and has now criticised the city council for taking her to court. She said: \u2018I was doing some shopping and was walking back home and cut through a couple of car parks. I heard these tyres screeching behind me and all of a sudden two women got out and started sprinting towards me. \u2018I didn\u2019t know whether to drop my shopping and put my hands in the air or walk towards them. I realised they had council uniforms on and they starting asking me if I was aware I had committed a criminal offence. \u2018The first thing I thought was something hadn\u2019t gone through the till properly at Sainsbury\u2019s. I hadn\u2019t even realised I had a cigarette. It is just automatic. 'I must have lit one up when I came out of the shop. My generation just discard the butts on the floor. If I had dumped a three-piece suite, then fair enough - but it was just a cigarette end.' Miss Copeland added:\u00a0\u2018They were just so stern and officious. The way they spoke to me was horrible. It is the whole manner, they acted as if I had murdered somebody.\u2019 The grandmother, who also has three grown-up daughters, is now considering whether to pay the fine by the deadline - which is tomorrow. If she refuses she could be taken back to court. Hearing: After failing to pay Miss Copeland was told to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates' Court (pictured) Miss Copeland said: \u2018I\u2019ve been treated like I have committed a major criminal offence. I didn\u2019t pay because of how they were towards me but also the principle. \u2018I\u2019ve always been led to believe the punishment should fit the crime and in this case it doesn\u2019t. I find it shocking. They are now saying I will face imprisonment if I don\u2019t pay the fine. 'I don\u2019t want to pay it because I won\u2019t sleep at night if I do, but I might have to. I thought they were bluffing and it was scaremongering - I can\u2019t believe they took someone to court over something this little.\u2019 A Coventry City Council spokesman said the authority had a \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy towards litter. Andrew Walster, who oversees the council\u2019s streets policy, added: \u2018It costs us about \u00a32.5million a year to clean the streets in Coventry.

        "text": "Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp .

Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker (Gabriel, 63), Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin (Walcott, 101), Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck (Giroud, 72). Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106 . When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season\u2019s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. \u2018I am happy we are through,\u2019 said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. \u2018But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him \u2014 I have been there, done that.\u2019 Clarke did his best to ease Federici\u2019s pain, too. \u2018This is the life of a goalkeeper,\u2019 said the Reading boss. \u2018And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There\u2019s every chance he\u2019ll be Reading\u2019s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. \u2018We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He\u2019ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be as good as he always is.\u2019 Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger\u2019s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal\u2019s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled.

They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored .

Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal . It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading\u2019s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs\u2019 head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici .

According to scientists, sugar consumption can suppress the hormone cortisol, which is released into the body when we are experiencing stress. Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40. Half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast, lunch and dinner over 12 days, while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame. The volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks, including fruit juice, outside these times. Before and after the study period, the women were given a difficult maths test and then underwent MRI scans to measure the response of their brains to stress. Saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol, which is made by the adrenal glands. The women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks. Dr Kevin Laugero, one of the researchers at the University of California, Davis, said: \u2018This is the first evidence that high sugar consumption \u2013 but not aspartame \u2013 may relieve stress in humans.\u2019 Finding: Scientists at the University of California, Davis (above) said the women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks . However, while research shows sugary drinks can help to dull feelings of anxiety, experts warn that too many of them could be habit-forming \u2013 and may explain the desire to comfort eat under pressure. Dr Laugero, whose findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, warned that chronic stress could prompt people to make a habit of consuming too much sugar, which is not recommended due to its links to health problems. He said: \u2018The concern is that psychological or emotional stress could trigger the habitual overconsumption of sugar and amplify sugar\u2019s detrimental health effects, including obesity.\u2019 In the US, more than a third of adults and about a sixth of children are obese, with sugar-laden fizzy drinks and fruit juice partly to blame. Around half of the American population consume sugary drinks on any given day. Dr Laugero added: \u2018The results suggest differences in dietary habits may explain why some people under-react to stressful situations and others over-react. \u2018Although it may be tempting to suppress feelings of stress, a normal reaction to stress is important to good health.\u2019",

Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial \u00a0Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters\u2019 third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele\u2019s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters\u2019 surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele\u2019s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele\u2019s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife\u2019s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses. \u00a0. Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.",

        "text": "The Residence: Inside The Private World Of The White House . by Kate Andersen Brower . (Harper \u00a318.99) For Americans, the White House is as iconic and royal a palace as you can get. For non-Americans, it is a respected power symbol,but not one to be especially loved. Kate Brower, an American journalist assigned to cover the Obama White House, became intrigued by the workings of the mansion after watching Downton Abbey.She set about interviewing the staff, who number at least 100, to build up a comparable picture of the American version of Upstairs, Downstairs. The staff all live out in Washington and commute in. The hours are long. Those on duty cannot go home until the President retires and goes to bed. So they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result. The pay is not great, but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends. Most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more. Ronald Reagan (pictured with his wife, Nancu) , on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours . The West Wing is the President\u2019s office quarters; the East Wing belongs to the First Lady and her office staff. \u2018The Residence\u2019, as the living quarters are called, really begins on the second floor and is kept hidden from the hundreds of tourists who parade through the state rooms every afternoon. Keeping the organisation running smoothly, from the workshops in the basement to the snipers on the roof, is a complex operation. It costs money \u2014 $13 million a year from government funds, plus a hefty contribution from the First Family itself. Presidents and their wives have to pay for their own food and drink and that of their personal guests. They are also charged for dry-cleaning. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, especially in the kitchens where top chefs are above such considerations as cost. Jackie Kennedy was heard to complain: \u2018We haven\u2019t nearly as much money as you read in the papers\u2019; while the Carters even asked the kitchen to serve them leftovers for their personal meals. The White House is never untenanted. The changeover of President takes place at 12 noon on Inauguration Day. Between then and 5pm, the entire moving out and in of the two families and their respective belongings has to be completed. The staff include ushers, chefs, maids, doormen, engineers, plumbers, full-time florists (the flower bill is enormous), even calligraphers who are kept busy writing invitations in fine script. But the glory of the place is its corps of butlers \u2014 six of them full-time, plus dozens more called in for big receptions, parties and dinners. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, Jackie Kennedy (pictured with her John F Kennedy) was heard to complain: \u2018We haven\u2019t nearly as much money as you read in the papers\u2019 Most, by tradition, are black. There is a picture of ten of them taking a break between courses in their black ties. What is the collective noun for such a fine body of men? A bevy of butlers? The Kennedys and the Clintons liked staying up late and entertaining until 2am, which meant that those on duty didn\u2019t get home until much later than that. This didn\u2019t go down well. Oddly enough, the best-liked couple were the older Bushes \u2014 George H. W. and his wife, Barbara, who were used to having plenty of servants and were relaxed and genuinely concerned about them. The black staff, especially the elderly butlers who remembered segregation, are especially proud to serve the Obamas as the first black presidential family. One found Obama and his wife, Michelle, celebrating gaining The White House on their first night there with an impromptu dance to a record by Mary J. Blige. And yet the Obamas have turned out to be rather reserved and distant with the staff \u2014 even, says one, \u2018stand-offish\u2019. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours. He had a disconcerting habit of sitting around naked reading the newspapers. His wife, Nancy, by contrast, was a martinet who collected Limoges china. Woe betide anyone who broke a piece. She would call a servant to say that the lights needed turning on when the switch was within easy reach. When she was going to be difficult about the meal service, which was frequently, she would send for the chef, cock her head on one side and smile \u2014 and then find fault, usually with the desserts served by chef Roland Mesnier. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons (pictured) used to share a bedroom \u2014 until the Lewinsky scandal - when Bill was relegated to the sofa in the study for a matter of time . Once, she decided at the last moment that the dessert for a state dinner should be sugar baskets each containing three sugar tulips. Chef Roland objected: \u2018But there are only two days left until the dinner!\u2019 She cocked her head: \u2018Roland, you have two days and two nights before the dinner.\u2019 Richard Nixon installed a bowling alley in the basement. He used to wander into the kitchens for a chat and discovered a washer-up who was also a keen bowler. They went on playing until 2am. Nixon then wrote a note to the man\u2019s wife to explain why he was so late home. The Carters made news by appointing a convicted murderess as nanny to their daughter, Amy. Rosalynn Carter was convinced she was innocent, and the first family\u2019s confidence was justified when the verdict was reversed. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons used to share a bedroom \u2014 until the Lewinsky scandal reached its height in 1998. For three or four months, Hillary made Bill sleep on a sofa in a study attached to the bedroom. Most women on the staff thought he\u2019d got what he deserved. The feuding Clintons were the talk of the staff, who overheard their bad language and the sound of objects being thrown in bedrooms. Hillary\u2019s voice screaming \u2018Goddam bastard!\u2019 was followed by a heavy thud. Much blood was discovered all over the bed. No one believed that her husband, who needed several stitches, had walked into a bathroom door in the dark, as he explained. \u2018We\u2019re pretty sure she clocked him with a book,\u2019 said one member of staff. There were certainly plenty to hand \u2014 there were at least 20 on the Clintons\u2019 bedside tables, including the Bible. But the biggest disturber of the peace was the huge bully from Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded the assassinated J. F. Kennedy. He gloried in his size (6 ft 3 in) and his achievements. He had TV sets installed everywhere and kept several on loudly as he watched himself in the newscasts. He undressed in front of the staff and gave them instructions while sitting on the lavatory, whose seat had to be replaced with a bigger one when he broke it. He drove the plumbers to nervous breakdowns over his shower. It was never hot enough nor strong enough for him. They replaced one after the other until the water came out as if from a fire hose and the heat generated set off the fire alarm. One water jet had to be aimed precisely at his penis (which he called \u2018Jumbo\u2019) and another up his rear end. He raged at the plumbers until he got satisfaction. Such was the man who escalated the Vietnam War.",

Police were called after Kenneth Crowder, 41, was seen by a witness on Friday running naked through a neighborhood calling himself God. He was also spotted committing an undisclosed sex act on a tree. Crowder\u00a0was arrested in Melbourne, facing charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer. Kennth Crowder was arrested in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday after being spotted running naked through a neighborhood claiming he was God . When police arrived on scene, he had put on jeans and a T-shirt and walked toward the officer in an aggressive manner as he called himself God, police told\u00a0WKMG. A police officer shocked him with a Taser twice, but each time he pulled the probes out of his body and attempted to fight the officer. The officer then punched Crowder in the face and he fought back, claiming he was Thor and attempting to stab the officer with his own police badge. More officers eventually came to the scene and helped handcuff and shackle Crowder. He was booked into Brevard County Jail Complex and later posted bond to be released. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances like marijuana, is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP. That's the synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone, the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Crowder was arrested on charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer . Flakka resembles a mix of crack cocaine and meth and it has a noticeably foul smell, according to WPBF 25 News. Once ingested, the drug causes a feeling of euphoria, hallucinations and sometimes psychosis or apparent superhuman strength. The high lasts for a couple hours and users are left with a strong desire to use again. Users have nicknamed the drug '$5 insanity' because hits often cost less than $10, according to the Sun-Sentinel. There were more than 670 Flakka occurrences in Florida in 2014, up from 85 in 2012 and zero in 2010, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.",

Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are \"conscientious objectors,\" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new \"no jab, no pay\" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. \"The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,\" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. \"It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,\" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations.

Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock ruled out several causes for a 56-year-old man's kidney problems before blaming the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily. Black tea has high levels of oxalate, a chemical known to produce kidney stones and even lead to kidney failure if consumed in excessive doses. Scroll down for video . Toxic tea: Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock blamed a 56-year-old man's kidney problems on the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily . 'It was the only reasonable explanation,' said Dr Umbar Ghaffar of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who wrote about the patient in an article for the New England Journal of Medicine. The man was admitted to the hospital in May complaining of nausea, weakness, fatigue and body aches. The chemical oxalate was found to have clogged the man's kidneys, to the point that they had become inflamed. With a habit of drinking about 16 8-ounce cups of iced tea every day, the unidentified man was consuming anywhere from 3 to 10 times the amount an average American takes in. The 16-daily-cups habit was striking on its own, since federal studies have found that the average US adult drinks about 10 to 11 cups of liquid every day, including water, coffee and other beverages. Ghaffar said she didn't know whether the man was drinking sweet tea, a concoction made from black tea and a hefty serving of sugar that is popular in the South, though he was diabetic. The New England Journal of Medicine has cited black tea in health issues before, publishing a 2013 case that found a 47-year-old woman had developed a bone disease from drinking a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 bags of tea every day. The Arkansas man's case, however, does not suggest health risks for most people, according to Dr Randy Luciano, a Yale School of Medicine kidney specialist.

But their determination to achieve the perfect glow appears to be fading away in favour of adopting a lighter look.

But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow . She said: \u2018Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!\u2019 Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman\u2019s Own event last year.

        "text": "Mark Wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived England suit. \u2018I wore it around the house a bit too much really but I was absolutely buzzing just to have it on. \u2018Trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started,\u2019 says Wood, one of the uncapped members of Alastair Cook\u2019s squad who fly to the Caribbean on Thursday for a three-Test series against West Indies. The 25-year-old would be forgiven for checking the fit, because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st, he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler. Mark Wood has been called up by England for the Test series against West Indies . When he\u2019s not steaming in to bowl at 90mph Mark Wood can find himself fielding for long stretches of time. Thankfully the Durham paceman has the perfect remedy to keep things interesting during a lengthy stint on the boundary rope. \u2018There are times when it gets boring in the field, so I bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team-mates,\u2019 Wood said recently. \u2018I don\u2019t know how the England boys will take it, but I\u2019ll have a go. I like to have a trot and feed him apples \u2014 he loves Granny Smiths. \u2018Sometimes it\u2019s just the pick-me-up the lads need. The horse will probably come with me to the Caribbean if he gets through immigration. If they don\u2019t like it then I can just tie him up and leave him somewhere.\u2019 But England are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful World Cup and Wood, whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run-up is reminiscent of Craig White and Simon Jones from previous eras, fits the bill. Several players on the county circuit last season would testify that he was the slipperiest bowler they faced. \u2018I can hit 90mph but it\u2019s not something I tend to concentrate on,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018The quickest ball I have been clocked at on the telly was 91 but I am sure I can bowl quicker than that. \u2018You know yourself, without the speed guns, when it\u2019s coming out lovely and the rhythm\u2019s there. \u2018When I bowl I am not just trying to blast people out, I would like to think that being the slight lad that I am with a short run-up, it is more the surprise element that gets batters in trouble. I tend to rush them a little bit but would like to think I have more skills than just raw pace.\u2019 Primary among those skills is a mastery of reverse swing. It was no coincidence that his first three County Championship appearances for Durham all came at Trent Bridge, where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. Durham paceman\u00a0is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler . But he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball, swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season. Previously, he faced a battle to prise it from the hands of his Durham team-mates Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth. So a marker of his progress was provided at the turn of this year when he was opening the bowling for England Lions on the tour of South Africa. That breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it, with Wood\u2019s devotion to the ECB\u2019s fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries, including stress fractures of the back, a cyst on his left ankle, knee trouble and side strains. \u2018My body type has changed a lot since I was the lad who broke through into the first team,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have done two winters now where they have basically pumped us up in the gym to get us stronger and fitter. \u2018I did a four-week camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, before Christmas when I was smashing myself along with the other fast bowlers. That got me the Lions call-up and off that, maintaining that strength, got me the Test call-up.\u2019 Wood has sought advice from former Durham and England fast bowler Steve Harmison . His first-class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances, 23, is a bit thin. But as he showed in taking four Australia A wickets in as many overs in a Durham win at Chester-le-Street three years ago, he has the knack of getting good players out. It may help him sneak ahead of Liam Plunkett or Chris Jordan in the pace pecking order. \u2018I am not going to the West Indies to make the numbers up. I want to play a Test match, whether it be the first, middle or last one,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s a good opportunity. As an England fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the Caribbean.\u2019 It was for the carnage created at Sabina Park, Jamaica, that Steve Harmison, another cricketing son of Ashington, was renamed Grievous Bodily Harmison 11 years ago. \u2018There\u2019s no pressure on us, is there?\u2019 said Wood. \u2018The last lad from Ashington took seven for 12. But if I get half of that I will be doing all right. Steve\u2019s a family friend so he\u2019s offered me advice on what the pitches will be like and how I should go about things. The main thing he told me is that the stumps don\u2019t move \u2014 we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in Brisbane (the first delivery of the 2006-07 Ashes, which went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip) \u2014 his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you\u2019ll be fine after that.\u2019 They are big shoes to fill but Wood appears comfortable in his own.",

        "text": "It is a well-known fact that the technology industry is mostly dominated by men, but now, thanks to a new blog by a young female computing student, women in tech have finally been given a platform through which their amazing achievements are being recognized. Stanford computer science student Lea Coligado, 21, created\u00a0Women of Silicon Valley, a blog based on the people-profiling website Humans of New York,in order to showcase the talents and stories of tech's best and brightest women working within the industry. 'Over the past couple years, I've come into contact with some awesome women in tech through Stanford or work, and I kept thinking to myself, why have I never heard of them before?' Lea told\u00a0BuzzFeed. Girls on top: Stanford computer science student Lea Coligado features talented women in the tech industry, such as Postmates exec Sara Mauskopf, on her blog Women of Silicon Valley . Relatable: Many of the subjects featured on the blog talk on subjects that many women in the industry will have had to deal with . Looking up: The blog has attracted attention from the best in the business, including women-in-tech advocate\u00a0Tracy Chou, a software engineer at Pinterest . The blog, like the one that inspired it, features photos and stories of subjects in the industry, often accompanying them with inspirational quotes. In the description for the blog, Lea says that the goal of the project is 'to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms.' In her 'Letter from the Editor', Lea also describes how an internship she completed at Facebook was viewed as a 'give away' by one of her classmates \u2013 who suggested that anyone would be able to secure one of the highly sought-after positions if a woman had been offered one, despite applauding a male friend for being given the very same job. She recounts other moments of horrific sexism she has experienced while working in various offices - from shameless come-ons from married colleagues to blanket, patronizing statements of 'women don't code' told directly to her by colleagues. The brains behind it all:\u00a0Lea Coligado, 21, created the blog after experiencing the bias against women in the industry first-hand . Underrepresented: The Women in Silicon Valley blog aims 'to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms' Quotables: The women featured on the blog open up about their own experiences of subtle - and less subtle - sexism in the office . It was after such experiences that, Lea says, she realized the importance of having idols in the industry. Speaking in more detail to Buzzfeed, she added: 'As a woman who's worked in almost entirely male environments, I know being able to look up to someone is crucial for getting through rough patches, for feeling a sense of belonging to your work.' The idea has already attracted some big names, including some of the most vocal advocates for women in tech like Tracy Chou, who joined social media giant Pinterest,\u00a0where she still works as a software engineer, back when it was still a start-up. Tracy herself has also made strides in bringing awareness to the gender disparity in tech. Inspired: The blog's goal is to is to inspire women to continue on in computer sciences, because it is more possible to succeed than some may think . All together: The blog encourages women to be proud of their own achievements and encourage others in similar circumstances . In a blog post last year on\u00a0Medium\u00a0the engineer wrote: 'The actual numbers I\u2019ve seen and experienced in industry are far lower than anybody is willing to admit. This means nobody is having honest conversations about the issue.' With that in mind, Tracy created a\u00a0GitHub spreadsheet in which tech companies could reveal their demographics to world, and over 200 companies have self-reported on their diversity since. But the numbers don't look good when it comes to some of the world\u2019s most well-known tech companies. Dropbox records that only 26 of its 275 software engineering employees are female, while Etsy records 19 of 149 and GitHub shows only 10 out of 160. In her quest to raise awareness, and with names like Tracy's in her corner, Lea is hoping to one day feature the likes of Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, and Laura Weidman Powers, the CEO and co-founder of \u00a0non-profit tech-focused organisation CODE2040. 'I want women who are sitting on the fence about Computer Science to get as inspired as I was by these role models,' Lea told Buzzfeed. 'And hopefully, to see that at its heart tech is exciting, immensely powerful and so, so worth it.'",

The video - filmed by a passer-by in Shanghai - shows the young woman dangling off the ledge having apparently threatened to jump, reports People's Daily Online. Police had failed to convince the woman - who was depressed after being dumped by her boyfriend - to climb back into a nearby apartment while firefighters on the street below prepared a ladder to try to reach her. Video footage captured the moment fireman Xu Weiguo grabbed the suicidal woman's arm just in time . But before the ladder could be used the woman became more agitated and suddenly lowered herself on to the edge of the concrete ledge. Fireman Xu Weiguo, who was also inside the apartment, immediately climbed out on to the ledge and video shows him grabbing her arm just as she appears to be pushing herself away. He holds on to her right arm and is seen calling for someone to assist him before a colleague also clambers out on to the ledge to help to haul the woman to safety. She was then pushed kicking and screaming back in through the window by the firemen before being restrained by police officers and taken to hospital. He had clambered out on to the ledge when police failed to talk her down . Having held on to her arm, a colleague then joined him to help pull her back on to the ledge .

'There was no time to think, the entire rescue took 2-3 minutes. Any hesitation by me and she may have fallen off the ledge so I didn't have any of my safety apparatus in place when I grabbed her. 'It was quite dangerous. Under normal operational procedures I would have to wear my helmet as well as my safety ropes.'",

The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club . Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a\u00a0Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match . The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February . Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit\u00a0citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago . The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time . 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club . The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining . 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause.

Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month. Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Disaster: Rescue workers and debris from the Germanwings jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France . Call: Klaus-Dieter Scheurle (above), head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month . Mr Scheurle said in Frankfurt: \u2018Such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations.\u2019 He added that it was important to \u2018think past today's technology\u2019, explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it. Mr Scheurle said that it was not the \u2018simplest solution\u2019, adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse. In charge: Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately flew the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board . Tribute: Flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the Germanwings flight in Le Vernet . A spokesman said: \u2018We also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement. After all, it's the pilots who are sitting in the cockpit and they're the ones with all the information.\u2019 The British Airline Pilots' Association also urged caution. \u2018We must act with careful consideration to ensure new safety risks or concerns are not created, such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft,\u2019 a spokesman said. Since the Germanwings crash, European airlines have implemented a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and Germany has set up a task force with the aviation industry to consider changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots. Commercial planes could be hacked in flight by passengers using the in-flight entertainment system to access flight controls, a US watchdog agency warned last night. Cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. A 'virus or malware\u2019 planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack, one expert told Government Accountability Office investigators. A GAO report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the Federal Aviation Administration must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology. The publication said: \u2018Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.\u2019 FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the aviation regulator has begun working with US government security experts including the National Security Agency to identify needed changes. \u2018This threat will continue to evolve and it is something that needs to be at the forefront of our thinking,\u2019 he told a Senate oversight panel. Politicians in Congress called on the FAA to act.",

Using statistics from Sleep Cycle app users, researchers have discovered that the earliest wake-up time worldwide is on a Monday in South Africa. While on Tuesdays, Americans rise at 7am and are in the worst mood all week. In terms of national average sleep quality, Slovakia topped the list.  The UK was in 45th place, while the US was in 49th. The best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. More than half (58 per cent) of countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day . Other countries that wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil. The Sleep Cycle app tracks a user's sleep as they go through a cycle of sleep phases. It uses the phone's accelerometer to identify phases by tracking movements in bed and wakes users up during their lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window. It has more than two million active users and gathered data for the study between 1 June 2014 and 31 March this year from\u00a0users\u00a0aged 18 to 55 in 47 countries. Other insights from this data include that the best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night.

On the same night, people in Japan get an average of just six hours and nine minutes sleep. This graph shows which days of the week countries sleep the most . More than half (58 per cent) of the countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. On Thursdays, people in the Middle East wake the latest and the happiest, and in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE in particular, users also reported the best mood on Thursdays. Despite waking up grumpy on Tuesdays, by Friday the US sleeps in the most and wakes up happiest. The data revealed Americans typically don't rise until 8:24am on Fridays and also report the best wake-up mood. MONDAY: The world wakes up earliest on Mondays with South Africa rising first at 6:09 am . TUESDAY: Americans rise early at 7am and are consequently in the worst mood all week.

For days now, detectives have swarmed over three bedroom Leeton home where Stephanie Scott's accused killer, high school cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, lived with his mother Anika and elder brother Luke. In a rare scene of frantic activity on this peaceful suburban street, home to families and pensioners, investigators clad in blue forensic overalls heaped bags of evidence out the back of the property on Thursday evening. Detectives had first arrived at the property on Wednesday night speaking to two occupants before Mr Stanford arrived home and charged after investigators discovered discrepancies in his alibi. Police allege they discovered blood inside the school cleaner's Toyota Hilux, a picture of a burnt body on his mobile phone and a set of school keys thought to belong to Ms Scott inside the property itself. Neighbours told Daily Mail Australia the Stanford family have lived at the property, which is on the market for $179,000, for 'around 13 months'. Gail Scanlan, who lives next-door, said they would regularly chat to the 'beautifully manner' but quiet Mr Stanford over the backyard fence. Scroll down for video .

This week\u2019s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue \u2013 and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video . Beach life: People enjoy the weather at Barry Island  in south Wales yesterday, as most of England and Wales enjoys  warm spring conditions .

Unusual sight: A man appears to walk across a rainbow at the beach at Barry Island, near Cardiff in south Wales yesterday . Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral\u2019s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: \u2018We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. \u2018On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. \u2018Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth:\u00a0Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week . Peak District awakening: The morning mist looking out across the Derbyshire village of Foolow, near Grindleford, which woke to a frost . Going for a walk: A deer in the morning mist near Foolow in Derbyshire yesterday, as Britons prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far . \u2018There is a cold air mass arriving on Thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week. After that we can be less certain.\u2019 The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation\u2019s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: \u2018No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.\u2019 After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days.

Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: \u2018Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. \u2018We\u2019re still in the midst of spring, so it\u2019s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.\u2019 Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: \u2018The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. \u2018This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.\u2019 And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.' Hot day: These graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow, with the South East expected to have the best weather . Arriving: The predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the UK from the south west . Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been \u00a31,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that \u2018much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds\u2019. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models \u2018now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer\u2019. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as \u2018tombstoning\u2019, can lead to people suffering \u2018cold water shock\u2019 when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: \u2018Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. \u2018But it\u2019s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.\u2019 On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood\u2019s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea.

The Brazilian midfielder was sent off for Internacional after a first-half off-the-ball shove on\u00a0Ypiranga Erechim striker Otacilio Neto that also saw his opponent sent off for retaliating with an elbow. But fortunately for Anderson, his colleague\u00a0Fabricio stole the limelight by swearing at his own fans and becoming the third player to be shown the red card, reducing Internacional to nine men in the 1-1 draw in Porto Alegre. Former Manchester United midfielder Anderson shoved Otacilio Neto off the ball to earn a red card . Neto also saw red after he retaliated by by appearing to aim an elbow at Anderson in Porto Alegre . The two players listen to the referee as he reaches for his card from his back pocket on Wednesday night . Anderson shows his shock to be shown the red card for what he believed to be an innocent challenge . While some players offered their hands in apology to the fans after being repeatedly booed, Fabricio took a different route and showed two middle fingers to the crowd leaving referee Luis Teixeira Rocha with no choice but to give him his marching orders. The 28-year-old left back reacted by tearing off his shirt, throwing it to the floor and shouting 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving,' as he walked down the tunnel. He has already been suspended until the end of the week by his club. Anderson ended his seven-and-a-half year association with United in February by signing a four-year deal with Internacional, but his return to Brazil has not gone as planned.

        "text": "Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed . A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own. Shooting: Above shows local news footage of the scene where Villegas was shot. He had just crashed his car after a chase .",

After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments,  SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp\u00a0said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre\u2019s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre\u2019s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey .

In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted.

        "text": "(CNN)Saturday at the Masters, like any PGA tournament, has been dubbed 'Moving Day'. It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. \"It could have been a super low today,\" a disappointed Woods said after his round. \"All in all. It should have been two shots better.\" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible . The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. \"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.",

        "text": "Catania, Italy (CNN)The boat that sank in the Mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid, a U.N. official said. Carlotta Asami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency, made the comments to CNN early Tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in Catania, Italy. \"They say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that, you know, a big ship creating a big wave -- they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance,\" Asami said. The account she offered differs from that provided by Italian authorities on Sunday. They said that as the cargo ship King Jacob approached late Saturday, migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved, and caused the vessel to capsize. Mark Clark -- a communications executive representing OSM Maritime Group, the company that manages the King Jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize. He said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side, causing many to fall off. The cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached, hardly making any waves, Clark told CNN. It deployed rescue boats, a gangway, nets and life rings, he said. The conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were \"consistent\" in what they were saying. She said their accounts made it \"credible to think\" that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya. Previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950. Italian authorities, who have been coordinating the rescue effort, say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, according to Clark. The cause of the shipwreck is part of Italian authorities' investigation, said Giovanni Salvi, Catania's public prosecutor. Investigators want to study the King Jacob's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat, he told a news conference Monday. The likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. Many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat. Asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat, while many people were down in the lowest area. Italian authorities said Sunday that an unidentified Bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily on Monday, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. They were the boat's Tunisian captain and a Syrian crew member, said Salvi, the Catania prosecutor. Italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to Catania, Salvi said, according to Italian media. The sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean to which European governments are struggling to respond. Vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue. The number of deaths has also skyrocketed. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week. It reported Monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters. Shipping companies recently warned that European governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. \"We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues, with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time,\" the European Community Shipowners Associations said in a letter to EU leaders last month. \"Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues, which also create serious risks to the safety, health and welfare of ships' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations,\" the letter said. Commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the Mediterranean last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. That's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the Italian Coast Guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the Italian Navy, which was running a special program, Mare Nostrum, for most of the year. European Union ministers met Monday in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" said Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security police. Mogherini told CNN that the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" But some groups said European officials were offering too little too late. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save The Children. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss,\" Forsyth said in a statement. \"Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Catania, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Hada Messia, Isa Soares and Atika Shubert contributed to this report.",

The United Nations' refugee agency, UMANITI, spokesperson Carlotta Asami said that the survivors claimed that the cargo ship was moving too quickly, creating big waves and causing the ship to lose balance. The conflicting accounts highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to assist in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said that the survivors they spoke to were \"consistent\" in their accounts, which placed the number of people on board the sunken boat between 800 to 850, while previous estimates ranged from 700 to 950. Italian authorities said only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, while two suspects were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily. The International Organization for Migration reported that more than 1,100 people drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week, with several other migrant boats in distress. The European Community Shipowners Associations (ECSA) warned that commercial ships are not equipped to undertake large-scale rescues and that European governments are putting an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. European Union ministers met in Luxembourg to propose a 10-point plan to address the crisis, including a need to increase resources at sea and fight human traffickers.",

        "text": "A bloodstained document revealing a life-or-death episode that could have derailed the whole US space programme of the 1960s is tipped to sell for \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White.\u00a0They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.' The auction takes place on April 24 in New York. The Gemini spacecraft (illustrated) was fairly cramped, leaving the astronauts little room to move around .

        "text": "The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera. During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports.

Niloofar Rahmani, 23, has defied death threats from the terror group and even members of her own extended family to become the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and the first female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Captain Rahmani and nine other inspirational women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award 2015 at a ceremony last week. Scroll down for video . Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 23, (pictured) is the first female female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 . Last week she and nine other women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award . Captain Rahmani is the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and has received death threats from the Taliban . She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit  pilots. Captain Rahmani said that ever since she was a little girl she had dreamed of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English in order to be able to attend flight school. She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant. She flew her first solo flight in a Cessna 182 and decided she wanted to fly even larger aircraft so she attended advanced flight school and was soon flying the C-208 military cargo aircraft. While women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers Captain Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers when she landed during a mission. She flew the injured men to hospital and reported her actions to her superiors who chose not to impose sanctions on her. When her achievements were publicised Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit pilots and immediately applied . She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant . The family has been forced to move several times for safety reasons. But Captain Rahmani is resolute and says she eventually aims to become a flight instructor to inspire other women and in spite of the Taliban's threats says she remains determined to continue her career in the Afghan Air Force and work as frequently as her security situation permits. She is also deeply committed to encouraging other young women to join the cadre of female AAF pilots. 'You can't just see yourself as a woman, but as a human and believe in yourself,' Captain Rahmani told WTKR. 'It was not easy finishing flight school, it was very hard, but someone had to accept the risk so that other women can do what they dream.' At the award ceremony last week First Lady Michelle Obama honored Rahmani's bravery, commitment, and empowerment of women and girls in Afghanistan. Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women\u2019s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk.

Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records. Because he was under 18 when the crime was committed, he is not eligible for the death penalty. He'll be formally sentenced in June. The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Jones, who was 17 at the time of the murder, will be eligible for parole starting in 2051, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO. He will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact. Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told Australian radio station 3AW that when police arrested the teens, Jones offered a motive that made clear that Lane, a baseball player on scholarship, was chosen at random. \"We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.\" After the verdict, Luna appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs, whimpering  \"I'm sorry\"  to a reporter.

In a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays, the principal of St Peter\u2019s College in Cranbourne East, Tim Hogan admitted that \u2018Class A\u2019 recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain. The bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months\u2013 from December 17 2013 until April 1 2015. \u2018The cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the College on the 30th of March, 2015,\u2019 Mr Hogan wrote in the letter, issued on April 14. Unfortunately for students, \u2018Class A\u2019 recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that\u2019s safe for watering gardens, washing clothes and flushing toilets. Students at Melbourne high school St Peter's College were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year . Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium. An investigation has been launched by the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students. The principal assured students, parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use. The other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water. The ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated. Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption . \u2018The Department has advised that drinking the Class A recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro,\u2019 the principal warned. However, preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that \u2018the vast majority were at very low concentrations\u2019, meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water. Daily Mail Australia spoke with a number of parents of St Peter's students. All the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they'd been adversely affected by the bubbler. A Health Department official will be on site at the school on Thursday April 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have. \u2018If anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, they should seek advice from their GP,\u2019 Mr Hogan advised. Families and staff are being encouraged to contact the Department of Health & Human Services on 1300 761 874.

Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing.

At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.'

Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday.

Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. He later described his release as 'wonderful' and during a press conference he said he'd always dreamed of going home.\u00a0His attorney said he will stay under a 7pm to 7am curfew with a couple in East Hartford. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail . One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner. He also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference. Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole. Lapointe's lawyer and supporters said the evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his mental disability made him vulnerable to giving a false confession. His case became a cause celebre, receiving widespread publicity as advocates for the mentally disabled and other supporters - including writers Arthur Miller and William Styron - rallied to prove his innocence. Finally, last month the state Supreme Court ruled that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his weakly arms raised in the air . In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. The decision upheld an earlier ruling by the state Appellate Court, which in 2012 overturned Lapointe's convictions for capital felony murder, sexual assault and other crimes. The court ruled that Lapointe be released or given a new trial. Murder charges have been refiled but the prosecutor, Gail Hardy, said the state needs to review the evidence before deciding whether it can go forward with another trial. Lapointe is due back in court on May 15. On Friday Lapointe, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, shackles and thick glasses, was hunched over and visibly shaking as he sipped from a cup of water in court. His supporters and attorneys say Lapointe could not have committed the crime due to his disabilities. One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner - he also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference . Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole (undated inmate photo above) He suffers from Dandy-Walker syndrome, which affects brain development and causes intellectual and physical impairments. They say Lapointe, who confessed after nearly ten hours of police interrogation, was railroaded under pressure and that he barely understood what was happening to him. Lapointe's release was processed by court officials, and he was freed from custody in the afternoon. The judge rejected a request by prosecutors that Lapointe wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. Defense attorneys say their client cannot drive and is barely able to walk, therefore he does not pose a flight risk. 'We are ecstatic that after all these years Richard is finally being freed. 'This was a travesty of justice from the start,' said Kate Germond, director of Centurion Ministries, a nonprofit organization that works to vindicate people who have been wrongfully convicted. 'He will finally get to sleep in a real bed and breathe some fresh air today for the first time since his unjust incarceration,' she said.",

But it was Tony Abbott's response to her transformation from man to woman that knocked her for six.

Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him \"your party won't be thrilled about this\",' she said, the ABC reports.

Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says.

She tried to resign from the office of former Chief of Army David Morrison when her transformation became public. He refused her resignation. 'It was easier to tell David Morrison I was transgendered than I was going to become an air force officer,' she said. 'I love the Army for that.'

But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.'

        "text": "(CNN)Twenty years ago, on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  The attack killed 168 men, women and children, injured hundreds more, and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. The attack's aftermath saw a storm of media coverage with themes such as \"attack on the heartland\" and America's \"lost innocence.\" In fact, the bombing took the country by surprise. It wasn't simply the scale of the tragedy that drew attention, but the fact that the bombing exposed something new: American citizens targeting their own government with a deadliness hitherto unseen. The public became aware of the true danger of the extreme right.  Reports connected McVeigh and his accomplice Terry Nichols to anti-government ideology movements, such as the militia movement, as well as to white supremacist causes. Law enforcement also played catchup. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1994 annual report on terrorism had given short shrift to the extreme right.  Its coverage of domestic terrorism focused on the activities of Puerto Rican radicals and animal rights and environmental extremists. In contrast, the report spent only a paragraph describing the threat from right-wing extremists.  It ignored the rapidly growing militia and sovereign citizen movements, and made no reference to events in Idaho and Texas. In late 1992, at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, a standoff between U.S. Marshals and Randy Weaver's family resulted in the death of a marshal, a young boy and the boy's unarmed mother. And in 1993, federal agents launched an ill-conceived raid on property near Waco, Texas, belonging to the Branch Davidians sect, leading to a bloody shootout and a 51-day standoff, which ended in the death of almost all the Davidians, including a number of children. These incidents infuriated the entire extreme right, which saw them as deliberate attempts by the government to kill American citizens. After Oklahoma City, everything changed. The FBI shifted its priorities, hiring new agents and reassigning staff to work on domestic terrorism cases.  It significantly expanded the number of Joint Terrorism Task Forces and went to Congress with a lengthy \"want\" list. The effort actually paid off.  Increased scrutiny of right-wing extremists resulted in a flurry of arrests for everything from terrorist plots to hate crimes.  Though it had paid a high price to do so, it seemed that the United States had recognized the dangers that right-wing extremists posed. However, just six years after the Oklahoma City bombing, an event occurred that pushed to the background those lessons so dearly won. The September 11, 2001, terror attacks -- attacks of a scale and ferocity that dwarfed even that of the Oklahoma City bombing -- commanded the full attention of the nation.  The government, law enforcement, the news media and the public all rushed to grapple with the issue of Islamic extremism. Unfortunately, rather than expanding national attention to encompass the dangers of both radical Islam and right-wing extremism, the 9/11 attacks simply shifted attention away from the extreme right. Certainly, the 9/11 attacks warranted great attention. They made starkly clear the threat that international radical Islamist groups posed to the United States. Moreover, the surge of right-wing extremism that marked the 1990s had seemingly ebbed. Thus it is no real surprise that concern over right-wing violence faded into the background. The significance of the Oklahoma City bombing, in terms of its service as a warning about right-wing violence, became greatly lessened. This is a lesson that Americans must now recall and recover. Radical Islam, whether abroad or homegrown, represents a serious threat to the safety and security of Americans.  But right-wing extremism did not disappear after September 11. Its history since the Oklahoma City bombing has consisted of a steady stream of plots, conspiracies, terrorist acts, and hate crimes.  It, too, represents a serious threat. In fact, in recent years, violence from the extreme right has again surged\u2014and at levels reminiscent of the dark days of the 1990s. From 1995 through 2000, according to statistics from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, right-wing extremists were responsible for at least 47 different terrorist acts, conspiracies or plots. However, during the past six years, from 2009 through 2014, right-wing extremists in the U.S. were involved in at least 42 actual or attempted terrorist acts. In other words, right-wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the Oklahoma City bombing. These statistics illustrate that \"homegrown violent extremism\" is not limited to extremism motivated by radical Islam.  The anger and hate that generated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 is still around in 2015\u2014and still dangerous. The 20th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing provides a new opportunity for us to ensure that its significance does not disappear from the public eye. What the tragedies of 1995 and 2001 together teach is that the United States faces threats from multiple sources of extremism, all of which must be taken seriously. Consequently, Americans must have the wisdom to respond effectively and intelligently to ideological violence stemming from all sources. That would be the most positive way to pay homage to the victims of April 19, 1995.",

I thought, \u201cGood on you, girl.\u201d\u2019 Here, some of Britain\u2019s real-life Rapunzels show off their locks \u2014and explain why they\u2019d never consider going for the chop\u2026 . MY HAIR GETS STUCK IN CAR DOORS . Fiona Steane, 50, is an artist . She lives in London with her husband of 20 years, Christopher, 48, a banker, and their 17-year-old daughter, Amelia. Fiona Steane, 50, (pictured) wanted to cut all her hair off when she was 15 but her mother refused and she's had it long ever since then and gets it trimmed twice a year . My mother always kept my hair long. She had very long hair and she liked me to have it that way, too. I was dancing back then, so it was easier to have it long and whip it up into a bun. When I was 15, I wanted to cut it all off and my mother refused \u2014 so it\u2019s been this way ever since. I don\u2019t like watching people getting their hair cut and I hate hairdressers. I couldn\u2019t even watch my husband getting his hair cut recently \u2014 there\u2019s something about it that makes me feel sick. I get it trimmed, just getting rid of the split ends, twice a year. Then I have a conditioning treatment, which takes up to six hours but feels amazing afterwards. I don\u2019t have a hairdryer. I\u2019ve never used one. I don\u2019t colour my hair. I don\u2019t straighten it. I just shampoo, condition and leave. It\u2019s pure laziness. This might look like it takes a lot of work but in reality I don\u2019t have to do anything. I do make sure I use specialist hair products for long hair. When it comes to conditioner, I slather loads of it on. This keeps it nice and smooth. My cut-off point \u2014 when I know it\u2019s got too long \u2014 is when I can sit on it. It gets stuck in car doors and it\u2019s always in the way. Fiona (pictured) says she uses special clips from Paris to protect her hair when she wants to put it up . My hair is manageable at this length. When I want to put it up, I use special plastic clips from Paris so as not to damage my hair. An Arab man offered to buy my hair once. I thought it was hysterical. My daughter has beautiful long, thick hair. Hers is darker than mine but it\u2019s stunning. I don\u2019t like it when people touch my hair. I have to remind them that it\u2019s mine. MY LONG LOCKS MAKE ME FEEL FEMININE . Sarah Rihal, 50, is a property manager from South London. She is married to Bob, 58, a pharmacist, and has two children, Alice, 27 and Jasmine, eight. Sarah Rihal, 50, (pictured) says she has had long her all her life and her youngest daughter Jasmine has hair the same length. Sarah says children in the school nursery often call her Rapunzel . I\u2019m not a very girly girl but I\u2019ve had long hair all my life. I went through phases when I was younger where I had shoulder-length hair, but since my late teens it\u2019s been down to my bust. My youngest daughter, Jasmine, has hair the same length as mine. Jasmine has to wear hers plaited for school. When I pick her up, I often hear children in nursery whispering, \u2018Look, it\u2019s Rapunzel\u2019 when we walk past. That makes me smile. I go to my hairdresser, Neil Ward, at his specialist salon Long Hair in London four times a year for a trim and conditioning treatment. The first time I went, I had my hair up in a metallic clip and Neil whipped it out and threw it in the bin. At home, I use a special shampoo and conditioner from the George Michael Long Hair range, as well as a cream rinse, which is like a conditioner that you comb through the ends after washing. I keep a jug of it in the bathroom, so I can just dunk the ends in after a shower. Sarah (pictured) uses a special shampoo from\u00a0the George Michael Long Hair range, but she says there are practical difficulties with having long hair like having to plait it at night to avoid knotting . I wash my hair once a week \u2014 it does get greasy but it doesn\u2019t usually need more than that. What I love about hair this length is that you don\u2019t have to do anything with it. I wear it plaited or on top of my head in a bulldog clip. I just wash it and let it dry which takes about two hours. There are practical challenges to having long hair. And, at night, I have to plait it or it would get knotted around my pillow and my poor husband! My hair is my favourite part of myself. It is the one thing that makes me feel really feminine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be tempted to cut it. Redheads like me tend to go white, not grey, so hopefully it will still look elegant in years to come. I GET PROPOSALS FROM STRANGERS . Melanie Brown, 60, is a retired teacher. Divorced, she has two grown-up daughters and lives in North London. Melanie Brown, 60, (pictured) says men have always found her hair attractive and that she has been proposed to twice thanks to her long locks . My hair started really growing when I was five years old and I\u2019ve only been to a professional hairdresser twice as far as I can remember. The first time was when I was 15 and my hair was thick and long. The hairdresser cut it to my shoulders and that put me off for years. The second time was when I was in my 20s and I\u2019d got my first teaching job. Headlice are a worry for teachers with long hair, so I marched to a hairdresser in London that specialised in long hair and said: \u2018Cut it all off!\u2019 They refused. They said it was so beautiful they wouldn\u2019t dream of cutting it. Men have always found my hair attractive. I\u2019ve had two proposals of marriage just because of my hair. One was from a colleague I\u2019d only been working with for two weeks when he said he loved my hair and wanted to marry me. Not surprisingly, my ex-husband didn\u2019t like the attention it got. Melanie (pictured) says she doesn't do anything special with her hair and washes it about once a week using whichever shampoo is cheapest . I really don\u2019t do anything special to it. I wash it once a week with whatever shampoo is the cheapest on offer at Boots. I don\u2019t use any special styling products, either. I just dry my hair with a hairdryer or, in the colder months when I have the heating on, I lie watching TV next to the radiator. Occasionally, I\u2019ll get annoyed with it. But it\u2019s part of \u2018me\u2019 now and I couldn\u2019t imagine having it shorter. IT TAKES FOUR HOURS TO DRY NATURALLY . Vanessa Thorpe, 40, is a production editor. She lives in Essex and is divorced with one son. Vanessa Thorpe, 40, (pictured) will only use hair products that have not been tested on animals and washes and conditions her hair every morning despite the fact it takes four hours to dry naturally . I love having long hair, especially combined with its unusual colour. I don\u2019t understand why some women feel compelled to cut their hair when they reach a certain age. I wash and condition it every morning, as it feels so much nicer. I never stick to one brand or product. I find my hair gets used to certain shampoos and conditioners and then they\u2019re not as effective. I never buy expensive products. The products I\u2019m using this week are Superdrug\u2019s Pro-V, but before that I used Sainsbury\u2019s own-brand. My only rule is that the products are not tested on animals. Vanessa (pictured) says she has never been tempted to go for a big hair cut but she has it trimmed every eight months where she has to stand up while they cut it . Washing it every day takes about ten minutes. Then I squeeze the water out with a towel and comb it through with a Tangle Teezer. It takes four hours to dry naturally, and I don\u2019t use styling products. I\u2019ve never been tempted to go for the chop. I had it hacked to shoulder-length when I was 13, but regretted it. I go for a trim about every eight months, and have to stand up so they can cut it. I don\u2019t keep it this length to attract men, although I guess they like it. My boyfriend likes it, but I\u2019d like to think he\u2019s attracted to me and not just my mane.",

        "text": "The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since the first was published in 1997. And now researchers have discovered its success may lie in the use of words author J.K Rowling chose across the series - rather than the texts as a whole. By scanning the brains of participants as they read passages from the collection, researchers discovered that the common use of 'arousing words' affected parts of the brain concerned with emotion. The Harry Potter books (pictured) have sold more than 450 million copies and its success may lie in the use of words used - rather than the texts as a whole. By scanning the brains of people reading passages from the collection, researchers discovered 'arousing words' affected parts associated with emotion . The emotional potential of words is rated in terms of valence and arousal ratings. Valence refers to how positive or negative a word is, while arousal refers to its 'physiological intensity', or the extent to which it affects the reader and their view of the word or text. These properties are normally used for words in isolation, which can be categorised as negative, neutral, and positive. But the researchers from Lancaster University wanted to see how these classifications and findings for individual words could be applied to passages of text and books as a whole. 'A text is more than a list of words, and the way these words are combined, or the context they are embedded in, clearly matter,' explained the researchers. They screened all seven Harry Potter novels: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (1997), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). Study screened seven Harry Potter novels.\u00a0Emma Watson (left) as Hermione Granger and Daniel Radcliffe are shown in Prisoner of Azkaban . From this, they selected 120 passages, each of which was four lines long and did not require a high level of familiarity with the books. In each case, the emotional connotations of the passages were at the start and and the emotional contents were unambiguous and consistent throughout the passage. The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages. Following the experiment in the scanner, each participant rated the passages on valence, on a scale of -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive, and arousal, on a scale of 1 for very calming to 5 for very arousing. The sentence: 'And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor', from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban featured a range, or span, of arousal. The researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of 'silence' and the high arousal of 'chill', which led to the overall lexical arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate. Meanwhile, the passage: 'Ginny glanced round, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry's mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds,' from the Deathly Hallows was rated positive. But its valence was neutral. The emotional impact is said to result from the drift of Harry's mind into the past remembering his relationship with Ginny and the fact the reader has to imagine it, rather than being told about it. And the sentence from the Half-Blood Prince: \"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\" roared Gaunt, losing control' contains words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal, such as 'disgusting', 'filthy', 'blood', 'traitor', 'roar', and 'losing'. Following the experiment, each participant rated the passages on valence - from -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive - and arousal - scaled from 1 for very calming to 5 very arousing. Examples are shown . The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these passages from the books before asking them to rate each on valence and arousal. A passage involving Ginny (played by Bonnie Right pictured left), and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe right) had a neutral valence . The MRI scans revealed that reading passages like the one from the Half-Blood Prince correlated with brain activity in regions associated with emotion, with building a mental model of a situation and also with the understanding of a character's state of mind. In particular, these emotional passages stimulated the left amygdala of the brain, which processes emotional reactions, and the insula. The more emotionally arousing words a text contained, the more it was judged to be emotionally affecting. But the sentence: 'You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!' from the Half-Blood Prince was said to contain words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal. This\u00a0stimulated the left amygdala of the brain (left) and the insula (right) which are associated with emotional reactions .

Thus, the researchers said the emotional engagement readers show is mostly driven by the single emotional words contained in the text, rather than by each passage as a whole. Psychologist Dr Francesca Citron from the university said: 'These results suggest that a text's constituting words can predict its emotion potential.' 'When we read a text, specific words reverberate in our minds beyond the more complex message conveyed by the text; the art of choosing the right words with the appropriate affective impact is part of what defines the skill of good writers or speakers.'

        "text": "A mentally disabled Colorado man was sentenced to 100 years in prison Friday for the murder of a Montana teacher whose death highlighted the downsides of an oil boom that's sweeping across the remote Northern Plains, bringing thousands of newcomers to the area. Michael Keith Spell, 25, of Parachute, Colorado, was sentenced following a hearing before state District Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney. Spell pleaded guilty in October to killing Sherry Arnold, 43, after attempting to abduct the popular math teacher as she was jogging near her home in 2012. Arnold's body was found months later buried in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was\u00a0'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack \"brought the devil out in him\" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December. \u00a0He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed:\u00a0Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston. Defense attorneys wanted Spell sentenced to an institution for the mentally disabled . Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family. Michael Keith Spell was sentenced to 100 years prison Friday for the murder of Mrs Arnold . But Simonton in May rejected arguments from the defense that Spell's history of low IQ scores, his difficulty reading and other mental problems rendered him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors recommended 100 years in prison and thus became Spell's sentence Friday. Defense attorneys Al Avignone and Lisa Banick said Friday's judgment will be appealed based on their continued belief that he was not fit for trial. If the state Supreme Court agrees, Spell would be committed to a state mental institution, Avignone said.",

        "text": "Eight San Francisco police officers accused of sending racist and homophobic text messages have been suspended, and the police chief is recommending that the veteran employees be sacked. Chief Greg Suhr announced in a statement Friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers . He called the texts 'despicable' and says those who sent them 'clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer.' Authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks, Mexicans, Filipinos and gay men, which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs, were sent between 2011 and 2012. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr (pictured) said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired . Texts between San Francisco Police Department officers included racist, sexist and homophobic messages . Suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that don't have contact with the public. The messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant Ian Furminger, who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison. 'All n*****s must f*****g hang' and 'N*****s must be spayed' were among the texts uncovered. 'It's not against the law to put an animal down,' an officer said, referring to a black man in Furminger's house. Other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f**. The eight officers include Captain Jason Fox, 42, a two decade veteran and Sergeant Michael Wibunsin, a 12-year veteran, according to the\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle's sources. Officers identified as Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year-veteran, Noel Schwab, 49, a 16-year-veteran and Michael Celis, who has been on the force for 16 years, have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign. Sean Doherty, an 11-year veteran and\u00a0Rain Daugherty, a 15-year-officer, are also facing termination. Robison, Schwab and Celis have reportedly already resigned. Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year veteran of the force, has resigned. He gave an interview to the Advocate in 1999 (pictured) about being a gay officer. He said 'the \"good ol' boys\" system is on its way out' The offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former SFPD sergeant Ian Furminger, who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month . The eighth officer has not yet been identified, and was not aware about possible dismissal as of Friday. Robison is openly gay and told the LGBT magazine The Advocate in 1998: 'The \"good ol' boys\" system is on its way out, and the newer generation that's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint' He was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed. In 2007 an officer named Jason Fox was\u00a0accused\u00a0of hitting a gay man's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club. 'Do you think we want your AIDS-infected pee on our streets?\u2019 Fox allegedly said. He  did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed. Police commissioners at the time reached a $83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man. The SFPD did not respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online about whether the incident involved the same Jason Fox accused in the text message scandal. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed . Minutes from a San Francisco Family Violence Council meeting show that Fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013. Celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife's hotel room. Wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed. He has called for the Department of Justice to investigate San Francisco's police as it did with officers in Ferguson, Missouri, according to KQED.",

        "text": "Sally Cox, 39, stopped her\u00a0son Jed Pearce, 10 (pictured together above), from going on the mosque trip, expressing fears of 'violence and guns' Children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a British mosque as part of a school trip over 'safety' fears, with one mother claiming she 'doesn't want to put her son at risk of being shot'. Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and\u00a0expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.'

        "text": "Kansas is one signature away from telling poor families that it's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol, tobacco and pornography, to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops, and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races. Swimming pools, jewelry and lingerie stores, psychics, movie theatre, nail salons, massage parlors, bars and theme parks will also be forbidden territory for the first time, if Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill that hit his desk last week. The proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback's policies, including one that requires 'temporary cash assistance' recipients to hold down jobs, look for work or enroll in job training programs. NO BENEFITS: A pending Kansas law would make it illegal for welfare recipients to spend their government-supplied stipends at strip clubs, among a laundry list of other places . NO INK: Kansas welfare recipients who want taxpayers to shell out for their tattoos have until July 1 to experiment with the latest in body art . PARTISAN: Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback (center) is likely to sign the new measure despite strong opposition from Democrats . Kansans, like citizens of many other states, are issued debit cards when they register for state-based welfare. Under the rules of the bill passed in the state legislature, bail-bondsmen would no longer be allowed to accept the cards as payment. Recipients would be limited, for the first time, to withdrawing  $25 in cash per day. Liberal lawmakers complained that some welfare recipients use their debit cards to get funds for rent payments. Democratic state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau told the Topeka Capital-Journal that forcing those people to make multiple trips to bank machines to pay their bills 'is ludicrous. It is outrageous.' State Rep. Carolyn Bridges, another Democrat, complained during a legislative debate that putting limits on how the poor can spend taxpayer dollars says to them: 'If you are asking for assistance in this state, you're sort of less than other people and we're going to tell you how and where to spend your money.' NECESSITIES: Tobacco will be added to the no-no list, along with movie tickets, cruise vactions and lingerie . I SEE A JOB IN YOUR FUTURE: Fortune tellers and psychics? Out. Job training? In. CONFLICT: Republican state Rep. Kansas state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (left) insists that getting welfare recipients 'back to work' justifies the new law, while\u00a0state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau (right) called it 'ludicrous' and 'outrageous' But state Sen. Michael O\u2019Donnell, the Republican who gathered support for a House bill putting all the changes into place, said public assistance should be spent 'more responsibly' than it had been in the past. 'We\u2019re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended' \u2013 on food and necessities like diapers or toiletries, O\u2019Donnell told the paper. The Brownback administration has signaled its support for the measure. It has already presided over a 60 per cent drop in the number of Kansans enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, during his first term in office. When Brownback became governor in 2011, the program served 38,900 people statewide. Today that number has dwindled to 15,500, according to statistics compiled by the Kansas Department for Children and Families. Numbers of food stamp recipients \u2013 a completely separate category of government welfare \u2013 have ticked down by just 6 per cent during the same period, however. Poverty rates among children have remained constant, according to the social-services nonprofit group Kansas Action for Children . The clash of statistics has raised questions about whether the state has actually been moving people off of TANF and into jobs. VICIOUS CIRCLE? Benefits recipients were previously permitted to spend their government money to bail themselves and family members out of jail . YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK: Until Brownback became governor, welfare enrollees could buy liquor with their benefit debit cards, but now his policy is likely to become a law that future pols will find it hard to undo . 'This is serious, good policy for the state of Kansas,' state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady, a Palco Republican, told the Associated Press. 'There's nothing better to get these people back on their feet than getting them a job and getting them back to work.' But Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly countered in the Capital-Journal that 'we pat ourselves on the back that our TANF rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it\u2019s because all those people are now working,' but 'we don\u2019t know that and I\u2019m guessing its not the truth.' Another Democratic lawmaker, state\u00a0Rep. Barbara Ballard, complained during a debate that telling welfare recipients that they can't use their state benefits to visit swimming pools would give the poor one fewer way to stay healthy. Republicans control both the Kansas House and Senate by wide margins. THe House vote was 87-35, and the Senate passed the bill 30-10. If Brownback signs the bill, it will go into effect in July.",

        "text": "All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite \u2013 which has a claimed membership of 1.42million \u2013 intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a \u00a35,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to \u00a3140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities \u2013 including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least \u00a314.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.",

        "text": "Nearly half of the British public believe the Duchess of Cornwall should become Queen Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne. A new poll by YouGov ahead of Charles and Camilla's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think Camilla should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king, while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were undecided. When the Prince and Camilla became engaged in February 2005, only 7 per cent of people polled by YouGov thought Camilla should one day be Queen. Scroll down for video . Almost half of all Britons believe Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, should become Queen when Prince Charles accedes to the throne although 35 per cent believe she should be rewarded with a lesser title . Half of those polled believe that Camilla, right, does a good job of carrying out her official duties . Aides have always insisted the Duchess does not want to be known as Queen and intends to be known as Princess Consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become Queen no matter what title she actually uses. Most people (42 per cent) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of Camilla, with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one. But the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed Camilla was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch, 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know. Of those questioned, 50 per cent thought Camilla had carried out her duties as Duchess of Cornwall well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well. Only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role. Some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know. Nicola Wildash, research executive at YouGov, suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to Camilla, rather than a large surge in popularity. 'The further we get from Diana's death, the less that will resonate in people's minds. As soon as the public see something for years and years, they become more neutralised to the issue,' she said. Prince Charles, left, and Camilla, right, are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary . Figures from YouGov in June last year showed 53 per cent thought Camilla should one day become Queen Consort, 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know. But Ms Wildash said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation. Almost two fifths (39 per cent) said they believed the Queen was happy with Camilla's performance as the Duchess of Cornwall, with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy. Regarding Charles, 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as Prince of Wales better than he did 10 years ago, while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago. But 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly.",

The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as \u00a36,000 each \u2013 far more than the \u00a328 fee that Sweden\u2019s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world\u2019s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium\u2019s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just \u00a39, while Turkey has the most expensive at \u00a3166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries \u2013 the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US \u2013 but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just \u00a328 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn\u2019t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world \u2013 behind Sweden, Finland and Germany \u2013 with a fee of \u00a373. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's \u00a333 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.",

        "text": "Around one in seven couples suffer with infertility and an increasing number are seeking alternative therapies in the hope it will bring them a longed for baby. Those who can afford it can turn to London's famous private medical haven Harley Street, where\u00a0Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai has been helping women conceive for decades using only traditional Chinese medicine. Now she's invited BBC cameras inside The Zhai Clinic, which she opened in 1996, to reveal the secrets of her success. Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai says she has used Chinese medicine to help a thousand women become pregnant . 'I'm a doctor who initially trained in western medicine, then I studied Chinese medicine as I realised lots of problems couldn't be overcome by traditional western medicine,' she explains to Vanessa Engle for the documentary Inside Harley Street, which airs tonight on BBC2. Dr Zhai's methods include acupuncture and prescribing a bespoke combination of Chinese herbs which must be taken day and night. The herbs may be drunk as a tea or are provided as a vitamin tablet - 12 must be taken in the morning and 12 in the evening. The vitamins contain natural ingredients such goji berries, Chinese yan and ginger. Dr Zhai says as a result of her natural remedies: 'I have brought more than one thousand babies into the world.' One of them was advertising director Jane Parker's son Rupert. He was conceived when she was 40. Dr Zhai prescribes a bespoke course of vitamins - 24 tablets a day for two weeks - containing Chinese herbs to help conception (file photo) Jane, from London, previously told the Mail On Sunday how she fell pregnant using Dr Zhai's methods after two failed cycles of IVF. She said: 'I'd read an article about her, and had arranged it even before I'd had the IVF \u2013 she had a long waiting list. I was in an emotional state of shock when I saw her in December 2008. 'I was convinced she was going to tell me I was too old. Yet she was incredibly reassuring, giving me confidence without raising my hopes to unrealistic levels. 'She ran a series of checks including blood tests and scans. She only prescribes after she's been through the results. 'In January 2009, alongside regular acupuncture sessions, I started taking specially prepared herbs, following her advice on which supplements to take and made several changes to my lifestyle (including giving up alcohol, taking no vigorous exercise and avoiding cold drinks). 'One month later, I\u2019d just returned from holiday and realised my period was late. I bought a pregnancy test and discovered I was expecting! I carried on with the acupuncture, herbs and supplements throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'I gave birth to Rupert in November 2009 when I was 41. I genuinely believe that if I hadn\u2019t seen Dr Zhai, I wouldn't have my son.' The new BBC documentary, which airs this evening follows May Lyang, 36, who hopes to have a success story like Jane's after five years of trying. She turned to Dr Zhai after losing a baby she conceived via IVF treatment on the NHS. Jane Parker had her son Rupert in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at Dr Zhai's clinic . She said: 'I got pregnant and I carried through for 11 weeks but then I miscarried a month ago. 'I think about it every day but you have to move on so that's why I'm here. You have to take positive steps and not think about what is lost.' May has an initial consultation with\u00a0Dr Zhai which costs \u00a3250 for an hour. During the assessment, Dr Zhai quizzes her on her lifestyle and observes that she doesn't appear to be in the best health because of the appearance of her tongue and her pale complexion. But she tells her she had potential and she's confident she will conceive. May pays \u00a3300 a month for tea made from Chinese herbs. Further check-ups with Dr Zhai will cost her \u00a3130, while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost \u00a3350. After a period taking the Chinese herbal tea, she is then prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day (12 in the morning and 12 in the evening) for two weeks, costing around \u00a3150. The BBC documentary catches up with May months on from her first appointment with Dr Zhai and while she still hasn't become pregnant, she remains hopeful. She said: 'I've got the clinic on my side, this can happen. It doesn't bother me that I'm not pregnant yet. At my last consultation, Dr Zhai said I'm not ready yet, I need to fix what's inside.' But May adds that if she still doesn't fall pregnant, she will ditch the alternative therapies in favour of IVF on the NHS again. Dr Zhai said acupuncture aids fertility because it 'promotes your body's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow' In her book, How To Get Pregnant, Dr Zhai said her methods work for those who can't be helped by IVF. She writes: 'I believe that our success rate is high because most patients who have trouble conceiving are not suffering from mechanical problems such as blocked fallopian tubes (these can be fixed by surgery or bypassed using IVF). Goji berries are one of the ingredients that may be found in Dr Zhai's fertility boosting vitamins . 'The most common causes of IVF failure are poor sperm production, poor quality eggs, malfunction of the ovaries or the blood supply with the abdomen not being healthy enough. 'Couples who find it difficult to conceive have problems that can often be helped by kick-starting the reproductive system, improving sperm quality and quantity and improving the menstrual cycle.' She said the herbal medicine, combined with a change to a healthy diet and light exercise, can work because: 'Herbal medicine has powerful healing properties which work on the internal organs and the reproductive system. 'It aims to clear obstruction, rectifies the balance between yin and yang in the organs and helps to restore normal bodily functions.' She also claimed: 'Most importantly, herbs have proved capable of reducing chromosomal abnormality in male sperm and female eggs so improving quality of both.' When it comes to another of her recommended treatments - acupuncture - she writes on her website: 'Acupuncture is believed to work by promoting your body's natural healing response and stimulating and balancing natural energy flow (known as Qi or chi). The BBC documentary Inside Harley Street also looks at other alternative therapies on offer for various ailments. 'Leech therapist' Maryam Rahbari, pictured, says the worms can work wonders for the health . 'Practitioners are trained to understand that the network of the energy pathway (known as meridians) that connect the organs of the body. 'When one of these pathways becomes blocked or malfunctions, problems such as pain, illness or disease may result. 'By stimulating the specific acupuncture points, TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body's meridian system, with the aim of restoring balance in the body.' Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient Chinese treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain. It has not yet been  proven to help women conceive but it is thought to increase the chances - possibly because it makes a woman more relaxed. As well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on Harley Street, tonight's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine hasn't helped them.

The Florida court heard  how Bryan Santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the Orlando home he shared with Shelby Fazio, 23, before waiting for the young woman to return, killing her and then abusing her body in October last year. Jurors were told Santana first choked Fazio in a headlock before wrapping a belt around her neck and stabbing her with a hunting knife. He then killed and mutilated her dog, and wrote messages in blood on the wall, including: ''I'm not sorry for what I did.' The panel took just two hours to deliberate on Thursday, and Fazio's family cried in their seats as the verdict was handed down. Maniac:\u00a0Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of the the cold-blooded murder of his roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday. He was sentenced to life terms in prison . In court: The trial in Orlando lasted just three days, with Santana previously admitted to murdering the victim and raping her corpse, with the jury deliberating for two hours . Overcome: Family members of the victim, Shelby Fazio, weep as her killer is found guilty on Thursday . 'This is endless': Afterwards the family said they will 'never escape' the death of the young woman, who was murdered by her roommate, Bryan Santana . 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will':\u00a0Judge Renee Roche was scathing in her closing statements, saying Santana 'no glimmer of humanity' Judge Renee Roche said Santana has 'no glimmer of humanity', according to WFTV. 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will,' Judge Roche said. 'Even her beloved dog will be remembered longer than the defendant.' Cindy Fazio, the victim's mother, said they will never properly deal with her death. 'No more pleasures in life. Each day is just another we don't have with Shelby. No more good days, only days we get through,' said Fazio's mother, Cindy Fazio. She called Santana a 'violent coward.' The victim's father, Terry Fazio, added: 'This is endless. We'll never escape. Hope you get it as bad as you did to Shelby.' Roche gave Santana two life sentences for the murder of Fazio and attempted murder of his second roommate. He was also found guilty of cruelty to animals, abuse of a dead human body and two counts of grand theft. Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida murdered his roommate Shelby Fazio (right) in October and sexually abused her dead body. He then killed her dog, stole their other roommates car, and went to get a haircut . Santana was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . Prosecutors said Santana 'delighted' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements on Wednesday. The\u00a0Orlando Sentinel\u00a0reported Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy took to the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roche after the incident, according to\u00a0WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this\u00a0behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the\u00a0strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He also claimed he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'",

Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep.

She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for \u00a31.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal. Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers . Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well . Graham Fleming puts up bunting in Dunblane's high street as shops  decorate their fronts in support of local boy Andy . Perhaps saving her legs for walking in heels tomorrow, she today stayed casual in red flats. Meanwhile, a smiling Andy was equally casual in jeans and trainers as he made his way into the cathedral where he will make his vows this weekend. With an Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon title under his belt, Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well. The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'. Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'. The minister, who has been tight-lipped in recent weeks, said he was 'excited' to be part of the service, as final touches were added to the venue.

The nocturnal shopping sprees are likely down to the 86 per cent of those surveyed who admit to turning to online retailers to purchase items that they are too embarrassed to buy in stores. The things considered too awkward for first person purchases include underwear, hair removal cream, personal hygiene products,  medication... and action figures. Nocturnal shopping spree: One in five Australians shop online at night in bed, while 86 per cent to going online for items they're too embarrassed to buy in store . And this is the least of stealthy shopper habits. The study, released by the\u00a0StarTrack Online Retail Industry Awards,  found work will often take a back seat when online shopping is only a click away. More than 27 per cent of Australians confess to shopping online at work and 3 per cent even took a sick day  to be able to sign for online orders when they arrived at home. These cunning capers even extend into the offline world, with 24 per cent of shoppers confessing to trying an item on in-store with the intention of buying it online later. Confessions of a shopaholic: 13 per cent of those surveyed admit to online shopping three to four times per day . Shoppers were also found to great covert lengths to keep online shopping habits a secret from their partner, friends or  boss. With  savvy shopping skills at play, it's no surprise then that Australians admit they are online addicts. Of those surveyed, most admitted to shopping up to twice a day and 13 per cent will click through online stores three to four times a day (equivalent to 4.6 hours a week). So how much are we spending? Three-quarters of Australians will spend up to $300 per month or at least $3,600 per year, according to StarTrack. Read below to find out which type you are... 1.

'They are co-conspirators and confidants for many of our secret shopping behaviours. Behind the safety of a screen we can be ourselves, so it's no wonder the number of Australians shopping online is continuing to grow year on year.

Gavern, in his 50th fight, was dropped twice in the second round and twice more in the third before the contest was waved off in Newcastle. But Joshua, who was returning from a five-month lay-off after suffering a stress fracture in his back, admitted he was not at his best. Anthony Joshua lands a left hand on Jason Gavern on his way to another convincing victory . Joshua dropped Gavern twice in the second round and twice in the third on his way to victory . 'I had a bit of ring rust so couldn\u2019t display everything I have been doing in the gym,' he said after his 11th professional victory. 'But once the momentum gets going I will be able to display some more shots, some more sharp shooting. 'I have boxed in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, London and I have to say Newcastle is right up there with the crowd, so a big thank you to the fans tonight. 'There are a lot of expectations and Jason is a very awkward opponent. He\u2019s a slippery customer and he is there to make me look back and he did a good job of that. 'I have a job to do and that is get a win. If I can start pushing to British titles, European titles step by step these fights won\u2019t really mean anything when I am experienced and a champion.'

Gavern did hit the canvas midway through the second after a short straight left although the 37-year-old complained he had taken a blow to the back of his head. He was on the canvas again after a brutal right hand followed by another left found its mark, but Gavern got up and defiantly raised his right hand. He was merely delaying the inevitable, though, and a flurry early in the third had him down once more before Joshua finished the job with yet another punishing left, as Gavern was this time unable to beat the count. Joshua will now face the toughest test of his career when he takes on Kevin Johnson next month. 'Johnson has same type of style as Jason; he was a defensive puzzle to unfold but I slowly broke him down and same with Kevin Johnson,' he added.

        "text": "(CNN)Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.",

The monuments of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of their unique architecture. But several of the most recognisable buildings in the city, including towers and temples, now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country yesterday morning. Scroll down for videos . Destruction: The\u00a0Dharahara Tower, which was first built in 1832, has been almost completely obliterated by Nepal's earthquake . Historic: The now-destroyed tower was a UNESCO World Heritage Site until its destruction this weekend . Before: The Kathmandu Durbar Square, at the heart of Nepal's capital, is full of temples and historic houses with their distinctive roofs . After: The square is now piled with rubble after tall temples were brought down by the force of the earthquake . More than 2,500 people died in the quake as buildings collapsed raining down debris on the streets below, while enormous avalanches on Mount Everest left climbers dead. One of the most prominent landmarks to be destroyed by the earthquake was the Dharahara Tower, also known at the Bhimsen Tower, which has almost totally collapsed after more than 180 years of standing in Kathmandu. The 200ft tower was built in 1832 by prime minister Bhimsen Thapa as a gift to the queen, who was also his niece. It had to be rebuilt after a previous earthquake in 1934, but the latest disaster has left the tower as nothing more than a stump, killing scores of people who were trapped inside at the time. Destination: Another view of the Kathmandu Durbar Square shows how it was a thriving hub for the city . Reconstruction: Policemen were sent in to the square after it was badly affected by the quake . Venerable: The Durbar High School in the square is a neo-classical building which was shabby but grand before the earthquake . Debris: The school is now surrounded by bricks shaken from the building in the quake . Heritage: The Bhaktapur Durbar Square, pictured before the quake, is another one of the three main public spaces in the Kathmandu area . Piles: The square in Bhaktapur has rubble heaped up after its ancient temples were damaged . Kathmandu's three 'Durbar Squares', the courtyards outside the city's old royal palaces, were devastated by the earthquake, with historic temples razed to the ground by the shocks. In the largest, known as the Kathmandu Durbar Square, rubble was piled up today after a large stepped temple was obliterated in the quake. Images of the Durbar Squares in Patan and Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, were also devastated by the shocks. The streets of Bhaktapur were impassable because of the rubble which lay several feet deep, with fragments of religious sculptures among the stonework on the ground. In Patan, a temple had its tower broken in half, while the square was strewn with bricks. Centre: The Patan Durbar Square, pictured before the disaster, is the third major hub of the historic royal family which has been devastated . Shock: Religious sculptures were lying on the ground in Patan after the temples they were once part of collapsed . Decapitated: A statue of the Hindu deity Garud was knocked off its pedestal at Patan Durbar Square . Crooked: The stupa of a temple was almost completely ripped off by the force of the quake . Holy:\u00a0The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the monkey temple, is pictured left before and right after the quake . Witness: A monk surveys the aftermath of the quake, which left the main building untouched . The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the 'monkey temple' which stands on a hill above the capital, also suffered severe damage. While the complex's main golden tower was thankfully untouched, many other temple buildings were totally destroyed. The Buddhist site dates back 1,500 years, and is considered one of the holiest places in the world for residents of neighbouring Tibet. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck just before midday yesterday, sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and the nearby city of Pokhara. Busy: The packed streets of Kathmandu pictured as they were before the disaster . Damage: A huge crack opened in the middle of the highway after the earthquake . The majority of fatalities were reported in Nepal, with deaths also being confirmed in India, Tibet, Bangladesh and the Nepal-China border. About an hour after the initial quake, a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours. Rescuers are still battling to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble, while climbers on Everest are waiting to be rescued by helicopter.",

And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic . The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, is the first to show that highly acidic oceans were to blame. And the researchers said that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was 'probably greater than today's fossil fuel reserves'. The Great Dying, also known as the Permian-Triassic Boundary extinction, took place over a 60,000-year period, and acidification of the oceans lasted for around 10,000 years. At this time, a single supercontinent called Pangaea covered the Earth. This huge landmass created extremely arid conditions and by the Late Permian, temperatures were at an all time high. These extreme temperatures already threatened many land and marine species, but this was made worse when large volcanic eruptions began to take place. Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth.

Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Researchers believe this acidification  lasted for around 10,000 years. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Oceans can absorb some carbon dioxide, but the large volume released - at such a fast rate - changed their chemistry. To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates (pictured) - which were on the ocean floor at the time of the extinction. From this they developed a climate model because the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions . Similar analysis in Italy found evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks. The rocks were found to contain vanillin (shown) which is usually broken down by bacteria. This proved acid in the rocks protected the vanillin, as its low pH deactivated the destructive enzymes . To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood\u00a0analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates - which were on the ocean floor at the time - to develop a climate model to work out what drove the extinction. A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found. One of the attractions of the theory is that it could have triggered other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions. Widespread ocean anoxia - a severe deficiency of oxygen - has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia - the presence of hydrogen sulphide - would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism. The rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions at the time. 'Scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time, but direct evidence has been lacking until now,' said Dr Clarkson from the University of Edinburgh's school of geosciences. 'This is a worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions.' The study is published in the journal Science and was carried out in collaboration with the University of Bremen, University of Exeter and the Universities of Graz, Leeds, and Cambridge. And the findings are now helping scientists understand the threat posed to marine life by modern-day ocean acidification. Dr Clarkson's research follows similar analysis  in Italy earlier this year by geologists from Imperial College London (ICL). They discovered\u00a0evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks from Italy's Vigo Meano region. 'For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar,' Mark Sephton from ICL said. The Vigo Meano rocks contained vanillin - the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour - and this was a surprise because vanillin is typically broken down by bacteria. In an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long, the researchers turned to the dairy industry, which sometimes uses vanilla in milk. Scientists recently used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world's oceans for the first time. The image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic. By using satellite data, scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes . Acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would break it down. The same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock. 'Our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning,' said Henk Visscher, a palaeoecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The findings follow a similar study in 2013 by US scientists who simulated the Great Dying. The MIT researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which would have affected plant growth. They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction. After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year. Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 to 88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction -\u00a0375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, although it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 to 87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event.\u00a022 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.",

        "text": "A mother whose teenage daughter was tortured to death by her sadistic lover has spoken for the first time of her heartbreak. Margaret Bates, from Mottram, Tameside, said she is still unable to read the autopsy report detailing the 150 injuries her 17-year-old daughter Kelly-Anne suffered at the hands of her violent lover James Smith. Too traumatised to speak about her only daughter's death until now, Mrs Bates, 60, said she is consumed by one thought - that she wished she had killed Smith when she first met him. Margaret and Tommy Bates are speaking about their daughter Kelly-Anne's brutal murder for the first time . Kelly-Anne Bates enjoys time with her friends . Mrs Bates, who has two sons, Andrew, 39, and Paul, 33, said: 'I know I shouldn\u2019t say this, but I wish I\u2019d killed him the first time I saw him. That way Kelly would still be alive.' Over three barbaric weeks, Smith burnt Kelly-Anne with an iron, scalded her with boiling water and even gouged out her eyes. Smith also tied her to a radiator by her hair, broke her arm and knees and stabbed her all over her body with knives, forks and scissors, causing 150 separate injuries before beating her with a shower head and drowning her in the bath. Throughout the horrific onslaught, the terrified teenager was alive, begging for mercy. Smith, who was then 49, got life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 25 years for his horrific crimes. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Kelly-Anne's death, but Mrs Bates said even with the passage of time, she and her husband Tommy, 66, are unable to read the post-mortem report which details the injuries their daughter endured. Flashback: Kelly-Anne and her mother Margaret on holiday in Barry Island, Wales . 'Every now and again, I phone the coroner to ask for the post-mortem report but each time I back out. I can't face it - I never will,' she said. Mrs Bates said as a little girl, Kelly-Anne was a tomboy who loved playing football with her friends. She also adored children, and often babysat for neighbours. She said: 'Kelly loved children and wanted to be a teacher. She was soft-hearted and very maternal.' Sadistic killer James Smith . At 14, while babysitting for a friend, Kelly-Anne met James Smith. He began a grooming process which was so secretive that her parents knew nothing about him for two years. When Kelly-Anne was 15, she stayed out over night and her panicked parents called the police. When she finally came home, the following morning, she claimed to have stayed over with a schoolfriend called Rachel. Mrs Bates said: 'I knew she was lying. It wasn't like her, but I'd no idea what was going on. 'Kelly was a good girl. As well as babysitting, she had a job on a market stall at weekends. She played hockey and she was clever at school. She was hard-working and sensible and I could never have dreamed she was being groomed by a monster.' She said Kelly-Anne once arrived home with a black eye and told her parents she had been attacked by a gang of girls in the street. Soon afterwards, Kelly-Anne announced she had a new boyfriend, James Smith, who she said was 32 years old. 'The first time I met him, he swaggered down the stairs and it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck,' said Mrs Bates. 'He was much older than I expected and this wasn\u2019t the man I wanted for my daughter. I vividly recall seeing our bread knife in the kitchen and wanting to pick it up and stab him in the back. 'It was a bizarre thought - I would never normally think of anything so violent and now I wonder whether it was some sort of sixth sense. 'I\u2019ve thought about that many times.' Kelly-Anne and her brothers Andrew and Paul have some fun on the beach . Margaret Bates said Kelly-Anne was very maternal and here the teenager feeds a baby . Margaret Bates and her only daughter Kelly-Anne as a baby . Mrs Bates called police and social services but because Kelly-Anne was 16 they could not help. She said: 'I didn\u2019t know what do to. She was very strong-minded and she wouldn\u2019t listen to me. And I was worried that, if I fell out with her, it would just push them closer together. 'One night she came home and her face was black and blue. Another time, her hand was bruised. I suspected Smith was hitting her, but Kelly-Anne denied it. 'I rang the police but they said there was nothing they could do without a statement from Kelly.' In November 1995, 17-year-old Kelly-Anne moved in with Smith who lived in Gorton, Manchester. Kelly-Anne gets to grips with crutches after injuring herself as a teenager . She spoke to her parents most weeks on the phone, when Smith was present, but never saw them again. Mrs Bates said: 'In addition to worrying about Kelly-Anne, our youngest son, Paul, was in hospital for weeks and I had a hernia operation too, so our lives were thrown into chaos. 'We even went round to Smith's address to try to persuade her to come home, but he was there all the time. The young Kelly-Anne smiles for the camera . 'On one visit he showed me a hole in his floor boards where he said he'd had a gas leak. 'Just a few weeks later, he kept Kelly prisoner in the hole while he tortured her.' Mrs Bates said she then discovered that Smith was 48 years old - 21 years older than Kelly-Anne. She said she pleaded with Kelly-Anne to leave him, but by now, Smith controlled all their contact. In the weeks before her death, Kelly-Anne endured unimaginable torture while her family - terrified of pushing her even further into Smith\u2019s clutches - waited by the phone. 'In April, I got a Mother's Day card from Kelly in Smith's handwriting and I'd had enough,' she said. 'But I was torn; I didn't want to keep going round there because I thought it was making things worse. 'It haunts me to think if we had gone round there she would be alive today.' Mrs Bates said she contacted the police domestic violence unit and was encouraged to give her daughter its leaflets. Tragically, Mrs Bates was never to see Kelly-Anne again and said she still has the leaflets to this day. On April 16, 1996, Mrs Bates said police arrived to tell them that Kelly-Anne was dead. Kelly-Anne had been starved and had lost more than three stone in weight. Loving tribute: A floral tribute bearing Kelly-Anne's name at her funeral, which took place the day before her 18th birthday . Her body was so badly mutilated that police and pathologists said it was the worst case of abuse they had ever seen. The jury at Smith's trial was offered counselling due to the horrific details of the case. Kelly-Anne was buried the day before her 18th birthday. Smith was jailed for life in November 1997 and during the trial it emerged that he had a horrific history of violence towards women. Mr and Mrs Bates have now set up a local branch of the national support group Support After Murder or Manslaughter (SAMM) for other parents and have found some comfort in helping other families.

At the launch of their manifesto today, the Liberal Democrats will vow to protect the entire education budget in the next parliament \u2018from cradle to college\u2019. Unlike Tory and Labour plans, spending would rise per pupil \u2013 with an extra 460,000 schoolchildren expected in the next five years \u2013 and also in line with inflation from 2018. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (left)\u00a0will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a \u00a35billion flagship offer to undecided voters. His wife Miriam is pictured in Marple, Greater Manchester yesterday . It is understood that Mr Clegg will say this is a deal-breaker in any future coalition talks after May 7, in order to win over \u2018centre-ground\u2019 Conservative voters worried about funding cuts for schools. Education is a sore point for many who backed the Lib Dems in 2010 on the promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then saw them trebled to \u00a39,000 per year. But Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now \u2018the party of education\u2019 and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today\u2019s manifesto of pledges. The tuition fees pledge was not on the front page in 2010, and the Lib Dem leader said those which were, such as increasing the income tax allowance, he had stuck \u2018doggedly, religiously\u2019 to. Protecting the education budget in real terms for children aged two to 19, will cost an additional \u00a35billion a year more than the Conservatives plan to spend, and \u00a32.5billion a year more than Labour. It would kick in from 2018-19, after the deficit has been cleared under Lib Dem plans and be funded by the proceeds of economic growth. Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now \u2018the party of education\u2019 and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today\u2019s manifesto of pledges . In a pitch to Tory voters in battleground areas such as the South West, Mr Clegg will say people \u2018are right to distrust the Conservatives on education\u2019. \u2018Our manifesto has one simple ambition and word at its heart, opportunity\u2019, he said last night. \u2018It\u2019s the very old liberal idea that every should be able to live out their life to the full regardless of the circumstances of the circumstances of their birth, of the income of his or her parents or where they come from. \u2018Education is the great liberator of people\u2019s potential so we need to make sure we support the education system in the next Parliament. \u2018The great challenge is we have more and more young people coming into our education system, so we need to make sure that the money is there to educate every single pupil even as their numbers increase. \u2018We are determined to make sure that every child in Britain has a world class education.\u2019 The money would be spent on qualified teachers in every classroom, training more teachers, more classes in small groups or one to one and expanding early years education. Speaking on the campaign trail in Lewes in East Sussex, Mr Clegg said he had noticed voters in seats fought between the Tories and Lib Dems were expressing concern about spending on public services. The Tories have matched Lib Dem plans to offer \u00a38billion a year in extra health spending to meet a request from the head of NHS England. By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail . The Green Party would abolish new road building and increase public spending by a fifth to pay for a vast wish-list of commitments, its manifesto revealed yesterday. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation. Launching the 84-page manifesto in trendy Dalston, East London, she said it amounted to a \u2018peaceful political revolution\u2019. Proposed policies include protections for the \u2018nomadic lifestyle\u2019, a promise to \u2018ensure respect for everyone\u2019, and adopting an approach of \u2018defensive defence\u2019 while abolishing the Trident nuclear deterrent. The age of criminal responsibility would be raised from ten to 14, cannabis and other drugs legalised, and there would be an amnesty for illegal immigrants here for three years or more. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation . But questions were raised over whether the hikes in taxes on the richest would raise anything like the billions promised. Even manifesto author Brian Heatley admitted the plans were based on \u2018a lot of estimation and judgment\u2019. The proposals would see public spending go up by \u00a3177billion a year by the end of the Parliament. A new tax would charge anyone with \u00a33million 2 per cent of their wealth, and top earners would pay 60p in the pound. Corporation tax would go up to 30 per cent from 20 per cent, the fuel duty escalator would be restored and capital gains tax allowances abolished. The party promises to scrap the \u00a315billion major roads spending programme, bring in a \u2018Citizen\u2019s Pension\u2019 of \u00a3180 a week for single OAPs and \u00a3310 for a couple, and hugely increase spending on health, social care and social housing. Foreign aid spending would rise by another \u00a36billion a year, child benefit would double, tuition fees would be abolished and pupils would get organic school dinners. Other policies include a promise to end the use of nuclear and coal power stations and ban fracking. Railways would be renationalised, there would be a ban on fur imports, and cages for rabbits and hens in farming would be outlawed.",

Brian Nicol, 32, dived into a swimming pool at a luxury holiday villa in the Costa del Sol, where he was staying with friends, but failed to resurface. His desperate friends dragged Mr Nicol, who was born in Glasgow, out of the water and tried to save him. Brian Nicol, 32 from Glasgow, Scotland, died while staying in a villa in Nueva Andalucia like the one pictured . Police and paramedics arrived shortly after the incident took place around 8.30am on Easter Sunday morning, but Mr Nicol had died. Officers said early evidence suggests his death was a tragic accident, but they will try to establish whether he suffered a blow to the head or a digestion problems which meant he couldn't swim. The group had been on a night out in Marbella after jetting to Spain on Saturday, before returning to the rented villa in Nueva Andalucia to carry on partying around the pool. A post-mortem was due to take place on Monday morning at Malaga's Forensic Medicine Institute. A police spokesman said: 'The incident is still being investigated but all the evidence at this stage is pointing towards the death being the result of a tragic accident.' Mr Nicol is believed to have travelled to Spain with a group of a dozen friends, who rented a villa in the exclusive residential neighbourhood Nueva Andalucia. Mr Nicol is understood to have gone on a night out in Marbella, pictured, in the hours before he died . Sources close to the investigation said they had been told the group had gone out for the evening before returning to the villa to carry on partying around the pool. One said: 'Our understanding is the victim had dived into the pool and swum underwater two or three times during the night without any problem but failed to surface the last time he jumped in. 'Although he appears to have drowned, it's too early at this stage to say why it happened.' Forensic experts are expected to examine whether the dead man suffered a blow to the head or digestion problems which caused stomach cramps and may have led to him drowning. An investigating judge has been put in charge of a routine judicial probe into the incident. A spokesman for paramedics involved in trying to revive Mr Nicol said: 'We received a call at 8.40am on Sunday and found a foreign man lying by the pool when we arrived. Paramedics tried to revive him but could do nothing to save him. 'An investigation into the death is now underway.' The group has only arrived in the Costa del Sol, an area popular with British tourists, for a holiday on Saturday . Nueva Andalucia, the area where the tragedy happened, is a favourite of well-heeled British expats and holidaymakers. It is a short drive from the millionaire playground paradise of Puerto Banus and boasts several high-quality golf courses. Max Clifford owns a luxury apartment near to one of the courses Sean Connery was once a regular at.

        "text": "Two of England\u2019s most ambitious and well-resourced academies go head-to-head on Monday night as Manchester City play Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final. Both teams are packed with talented players eager to make an impression in front of the TV cameras and stake their claim for first-team involvement in the seasons to come. Ahead of the match at City\u2019s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . WHAT\u2019S THE OCCASION? It\u2019s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it\u2019ll take place at City\u2019s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their \u00a3200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox\u2019s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry . Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . It wasn\u2019t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards\u2019 team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James\u2019 Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month . Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head. A Colkett penalty then put daylight between the teams as Chelsea won a thrilling tie 5-4 on aggregate. YOUTH CUP PEDIGREE . Manchester City have twice lifted the FA Youth Cup - in 1986 and 2008. The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League. Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons. Their wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: \u2018Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea. It\u2019s up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I\u2019m convinced once they see us it\u2019s very difficult to walk away from.\u2019 Chelsea coach Joe Edwards: \u2018Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week [when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League] is a massive plus for us. Once you get a taste of winning, you want that feeling again and again.\u2019 PLAYERS TO WATCH . MANCHESTER CITY . Brandon Barker - speedy winger who has been on the books at City\u2019s academy since the age of eight.

Should he score in the final, he will also have scored in each round of the Youth Cup. England under 18 international. Solanke (left) has been in prolific form for Chelsea both at home and abroad this season .

That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.",

        "text": "Julie McKenzie thought scoliosis was the cause of her bad back . Julie McKenzie was assured by her GP that her nagging back pain was down to a mild curvature of the spine. She'd gone to see him three months after suddenly developing back problems and had been referred for X-rays. These revealed that her spine was slightly curved, a condition known as scoliosis. 'My GP said that as far as he was concerned, my pain was the result of the scoliosis and that I should try Pilates to build up my muscle strength'. But Julie, 53, felt there was more to it - she'd always been strong and active until the pain began in the spring of 2013. As she explains: 'I'd been doing a lot of gardening, and noticed my lower back ached afterwards,' she says. 'At first a hot bath would sort it out, but as the months passed I found the aching was bad after strenuous activity, such as DIY, and didn't go away after a bath any more.' Painkillers were of little help. 'If I made a sudden movement, I'd experience a sharp, pinching pain in my lower spine that would take my breath away and force me to stop whatever I was doing.' A month after seeing her GP, and feeling increasingly desperate, Julie, an administrator, who is divorced with two grown-up children, and lives in Bushey, Herts, used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon, Robert Lee. The consultant ordered an MRI scan, which showed that she did have some scoliosis and her discs had signs of wear and tear, suggesting arthritis. But crucially the radiographer spotted that Julie's coccyx - the bone at the tail of the spine - was slightly enlarged. It contained a tumour. Cases like Julie's are why some experts feel that too often back pain is written off as something that is to be endured, rather than investigated. 'Eighty per cent of people will experience an episode of severe back pain in their lifetime - but only 8 per cent of these go on to suffer chronic pain,' says Peter Hamlyn, a neurosurgeon at University College Hospital London and the Spine Surgery London. 'Many of these chronic sufferers are simply dismissed as having 'non-specific low back pain'. 'That term needs to be abandoned and early referral for investigation and diagnosis-based treatment should instead become the norm.' Back pain is 'very often under-investigated', adds surgeon Robert Lee, of the Spire Hospital in Bushey. 'This means that treatable conditions such as disc prolapses, osteoporotic fractures, deformity, infection and tumours can be missed.' She sought a second opinion from a private surgeon, who sent her for an MRI scan . He adds: 'Most back pain is the result of muscular strains, and is short-lived.'As long as there are no 'red flag' symptoms - such as numbness around the groin and difficulties passing urine or with your bowels - then painkillers and physiotherapy are good approaches. 'However, an MRI should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly.' For instance, arthritis may be relieved with a simple painkilling spinal injection. If the pain is being caused by a nerve being compressed, treatment may involve surgery. Around 1,000 people a year are diagnosed with tumours - benign or malignant - that start in the spine. In many cases, a growth on the spine will be a benign notochordal tumour. These are made of tissue left over from embyronic cells which help form a baby's spinal cord. By the time a baby is born, these cells should have disappeared - if they remain, and nobody knows why this happens, they can develop into tumours. It's estimated that 14 per cent of people have this kind of benign tumour on their spine and, in most, these are harmless. Much more rarely, spinal tumours are malignant. Sometimes these are secondary to cancer elsewhere in the body, particularly breast, brain or pancreatic cancer. Cancer cells often go to the bones with the greatest blood supply, which includes the spine. These, too, can cause back pain. Less commonly, the problem is a malignant tumour called a chordoma that originates in the spine. Typically, they occur in adults between ages 40 and 70, and often they are detected late - patients live on average just six years after diagnosis. A very observant radiologist spotted a tumour, which was removed . Chordomas can occur anywhere along the spine, and the later symptoms such as back pain, numbness, aching and tingling can be mistaken for more minor strains or disc problems. As they get bigger, they may also cause changes in bowel and bladder function, and weakness of the arms and legs. In up to 40 per cent of patients they spread to the lungs, liver, bones, and skin. Although it was apparent from her MRI that Julie had a tumour, it was impossible to tell if it was cancerous or benign. The only options were to remove the entire coccyx, or leave the tumour and scan every few months to see if it grew. Mr Lee recommended removing it. 'The coccyx isn't a necessary part of our anatomy. In fact, it's simply the remains of a tail from an earlier stage in our evolution,' he says. Julie had her operation in October 2013. Her coccyx was removed, complete with the 2cm tumour inside it. The tumour was sent for testing and was found to be malignant. However, it was surrounded by healthy tissue within the bone, which meant it had not spread. 'I asked Mr Lee to tell me the results over the phone,' Julie recalls. 'I didn't know what to feel as I was in the very strange position of not actually knowing I had cancer until I was cured.' Following the surgery, sitting hurt so much that Julie was off work for six weeks. She now has a three-inch scar, and will need scans every year for five years - 'But after that we would consider her cured,' says Mr Lee. 'If the tumour was found later, the outcome could have been much bleaker.' Ironically, after the operation, Julie still has back pain as a result of her arthritis. But she feels that dealing with the pain is nothing compared with what might have been. 'I'm so pleased I made a fuss instead of leaving things,' she says. brainandspine.org.uk .",
        "generated": "Julie McKenzie, 53, had been experiencing back pain for several months, which she assumed was due to scoliosis. Her GP confirmed her suspicions with an X-ray, but a subsequent MRI revealed that her coccyx, located at the base of the spine, contained a tumor. Julie was diagnosed with chordoma, a rare type of spinal tumor. The tumor was removed, and she is currently awaiting test results to determine the extent of the cancer. The story highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis in managing back pain and the potential risks of ignoring symptoms.",

Curiously absent from the final vote was Texas Senator Ted Cruz - a key opponent of Lynch's nomination. He was the only member of the Senate who did not cast a vote. A copy of a Cruz for President invitation later began flying around Twitter that showed the GOP presidential candidate had skipped town early to make an appearance at a fundraiser at the home of former Texas Rangers owner and billionaire Tom Hicks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . IN:\u00a0The first black woman to become the top U.S. law enforcement official, Lynch, 55, was approved by a 56-43 vote, with 10 Republicans joining with Senate Democrats to approve her . OUT:\u00a0She is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder . Lynch is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. The White House said it did not know when exactly Lynch would be sworn in but it wasn't likely to be today. President Barack Obama said in a statement after that the vote that 'America will be better off' having Lynch as its next top cop. 'She will bring to bear her experience as a tough, independent, and well-respected prosecutor on key, bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform,' he said. 'Loretta\u2019s confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law.' Ten . Republicans voted for Lynch, including Senate Majority Leader . Mitch McConnell and expected presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina. Florida's Marco Rubio did not vote in her favor. Cruz tried to block Lynch from clearing a procedural hurdle earlier in the day, giving an impassioned speech on the chamber floor urging his colleagues to oppose her nomination, but was missing when the final tally was taken. 'The Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this nomination,' the 2016 Oval Office candidate said said during the debate on whether to take a formal vote on her nomination. 'I would note there are a few voters back home that are asking what exactly is the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority,' he charged. It was not immediately clear why the senator - who had not been shy about his intentions to vote against Lynch - was absent from the floor during the formal vote and a spokeswoman for his 2016 campaign simply told Daily Mail Online that he had a prior commitment in Texas. Like a representative from his Senate office noted on Twitter, the spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said he voted no on cloture, and that's the only one 'that mattered.' 'As you know Sen. Cruz led the charge to oppose her nomination at every turn for the last several months,' she added. Minutes later the Cruz for President invitation began circulating online. The  VIP portion of the event starts at 6 pm central, meaning Cruz needed to leave the East Coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time. Hicks, who is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month, is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W. Bush, also a Republican and a former co-owner of the Rangers. MISSING:\u00a0Ted Cruz was not present for today's final vote on Lynch. He was the only member of the Senate who was absent.\u00a0A copy of a Cruz for President invitation that later began flying around Twitter indicates the Texas senator skipped town early to make a fundraiser at the home of former Texas Rangers owner and billionaire Tom Hicks . The voting margin reflected\u00a0many Republicans' disapproval of . Lynch's support for an executive order issued by Obama in . November that was meant to shield millions of undocumented . immigrants from the threat of deportation. Before the vote, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, an . outspoken critic of that action, blasted Lynch. 'We do not have to confirm someone to the highest law . enforcement position in America if that someone is publicly . committed to denigrating Congress, violating law,' he said. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid berated Republicans for . delaying the confirmation and said Lynch was 'as qualified a . candidate' as he'd seen in almost 30 years in the Senate. Lynch has awaited confirmation since November when Obama, a . fellow Harvard Law School graduate, nominated her. After winning November's midterm elections, Republicans asked the Democratic-led Senate not to shove a vote on Lynch down their throats. In a show of good faith, Democrats acquiesced and let the clock run out on their leadership in the Senate. Her nomination was backed by the Senate's Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12-8 on Feb. 26. But her confirmation languished over an impasse in the Republican-led Senate on an unrelated bill meant to protect human trafficking victims. Democrats had balked at an anti-abortion provision included in that bill, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell put a hold on all business until that issue was resolved. A bipartisan agreement was reached earlier this week, and as a result the process to consider Lynch was allowed to move forward. Hicks is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month. He is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W. Bush, also a Republican and a former co-owner of the Rangers . MYSTERY SOLVED:\u00a0Minutes after a spokesperson for Cruz told Daily Mail Online that the senator had a prior commitment in Texas that caused him to miss the vote, this Cruz for President invitation began circulating online. The VIP portion of the event begins at 6pm central, meaning Cruz needed to leave the East Coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time . Despite the delay, she was widely seen as less controversial . than Holder, who often clashed with Republicans. She has said . she aims to smooth relations with Congress. As attorney general, her earliest tests will likely include . handling civil rights cases stemming from deadly altercations . between police and unarmed black men in several U.S. cities. The . Justice Department has said it will look into bringing civil . rights charges over the death of a Baltimore man who died after . sustaining a spinal cord injury while in police custody. Lynch will also inherit major financial cases involving . allegations that some of the world's largest banks helped . clients evade U.S. taxes and manipulated the currency markets. An accomplished career prosecutor, Lynch has twice served as . U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, New York, most recently since 2010. Her office there handled more terrorism prosecutions than most . other offices in the United States. For two years, she also led . a committee that advised the attorney general on policy. At a Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 28, Lynch said that . her top priorities would include fighting terrorist threats and . cyber crime, and improving relations between law enforcement and . minority communities.",

He will take over the program in June; he'll remain the channel's chief Washington correspondent and the anchor of the weekday afternoon newscast \"The Lead.\" Among his peers, Tapper is seen as an authority on politics, something a program like \"State of the Union\" demands. He received rave reviews when he was the interim anchor of ABC's Sunday morning hour \"This Week\" in 2010. \"I couldn't be more excited about this election season and the new platform I will have at CNN to cover it,\" Tapper said in a statement. \"'State Of The Union' has a rich tradition and I hope to not only build on its history but expand the definition of what a Sunday show can be.\" Tapper thanked CNN Worldwide CEO Jeff Zucker \"for the confidence he continues to show in me and to my colleagues at CNN for the incredible support on air and off that I've received since beginning this adventure two years ago.\" Tapper joined CNN from ABC in 2013 to anchor \"The Lead.\" On \"State of the Union,\" he succeeds Candy Crowley, who signed off the program last December. A rotation of fill-in hosts have been anchoring the program this year. Zucker announced Tapper's appointment on the network's editorial conference call on Friday morning. \"I am thrilled that Jake will take on this additional role at such a pivotal time in the election cycle,\" Zucker said in a statement. \"He has the perfect combination of skills that make him uniquely qualified -- he's a relentless reporter, a gifted storyteller, and a terrific interviewer who doesn't stop until he gets answers. We are lucky to have him on both 'The Lead' and 'State of the Union.'\" Sunday political programs are among the most prestigious chairs at television networks. And changes are afoot: CBS is about to say goodbye to Bob Schieffer, the longtime moderator of \"Face the Nation,\" who will be succeeded by John Dickerson in June. Additionally, NBC replaced David Gregory with Chuck Todd on the original Sunday public affairs program, \"Meet the Press,\" last fall. With the anchor moves at the other networks, CNN may see an opportunity for what's known in the industry as share-shifting -- viewers switching networks and sampling the new anchors.

Wilshere has been out of action since suffering the injury in the 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United on November 22 but is finally nearing full fitness. It has been the latest in a succession of injury problems that have hampered his development into the world class player he was expected to become for club and country. Having made a return to action in a reserve friendly with Brentford last week, this was a step up in quality for Wilshere and he exerted a quiet influence without taking a hold on the game. He saw a free-kick 25 yards from goal deflected just over the crossbar early on and initiated a move later in the first-half that culminated in Serge Gnabry firing a snapshot on the turn that was saved the legs of Stoke goalkeeper Daniel Gyollai. Wilshere might have capped his night with a goal but his improvised volley from a Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill cross was saved before Stephy Mavididi slammed home the rebound for Arsenal\u2019s third on 73 minutes. Arteta, who has been on the sidelines since the Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund on November 26, captained the team but failed to make much of an impact during his hour of involvement. Diaby, whose never-ending succession of injuries has seen him absent for an astonishing 226 weeks of his Arsenal career, was arguably their most influential performer as he fights for a new contract. Mikel Arteta was among the players as he stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury . Wilshere runs with the ball during the U21 Premier League match on Tuesday night at the Emirates . With his runs through the centre of midfield, Diaby caused plenty of problems for the Stoke defence and he had two opportunities to get on the scoresheet in his 70 minutes of action. On 17 minutes, a lovely through ball from Gnabry set him clear inside the box but a last-ditch tackle ruined everything and, shortly afterwards, he curled a shot a fraction over the bar from the edge of the area. With the first-teamers mis-firing, it was left to Alex Iwobi to make an impression with two clinical first-half goals that were almost identical and a stoppage time third. On 23 minutes, Iwobi, who is capped for England\u2019s youth teams but likely to play for Nigeria, surged at the Stoke defence, beat two men and fired crisply across the keeper and into the far corner. And he repeated the trick five minutes before the break, locating the same corner from pretty much the same position after latching on to Diaby\u2019s slide-rule pass. Abou Diaby of Arsenal pictured shooting during the match between Arsenal U21 and Stoke City U21 . England midfielder Wilshere came through the 4-1 win over Stoke unscathed on Tuesday night . Arsenal had started on the back foot and fell behind eight minutes in when the highly-rated Ollie Shenton was gifted the simplest of close-range finishes when goalkeeper Deyan Iliev fumbled a cross from Nathan Ricketts-Hopkinson. But by the time Iwobi completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, Arsenal were in complete control. It was the best of the young striker\u2019s treble as he burst forward at lightning pace and delicately lifted the ball over the keeper. When Arsenal\u2019s senior side have been a First Division team for a century, it seems incongruous to find the under 21s stuck in the second division. But that could soon be rectified. This win kept them in touch with the leading pack and Arsenal retain games in hand on all above them as they seek to claim one of the two promotion places to the top division.",

Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current on the brain's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent . As well as creativity, these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression. Flavio Frohlich, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina said: 'If we could enhance these brain activity patterns, then we could potentially help many people.' Alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 Hertz 9 (or cycles per second). They were discovered in 1929 by Hans Berger, who invented EEG. Alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli \u2013 things we see, feel, taste, smell, and hear. When alpha oscillations are active, your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas. When you come fully online, alpha oscillations disappear. Other oscillations at higher frequencies, such as gamma oscillations, take over. An EEG of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain. Enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression, scientists claim . They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. They then recorded the results using EEG . Knowing this, other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity. Professor Frohlich set out to find evidence. His idea was simple. If he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity. For the study, Professor Frohlich's team enrolled 20 healthy adults. Researchers placed electrodes on each side of each participant's frontal scalp and a third electrode toward the back of the scalp. An experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks, scientists have found. The technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus. However, new research from the University of Oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique, which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current, may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task. They found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums, it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline. A follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly. This way, the 10-Hertz alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison. Each participant underwent two sessions. During one session, researchers used a 10-Hertz sham stimulation for just five minutes. Participants felt a tingle at the start of the five minutes. For the next 25 minutes, each participant continued to take the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. In one task, each participant was shown a small fraction of an illustration \u2013 sometimes just a bent line on a piece of paper. Participants used the line to complete an illustration, and they wrote a title when they finished. In the other session each participant underwent the same protocol, except they were stimulated at 10 Hertz for the entire 30 minutes while doing the Torrance test. The tingling sensation only occurred at the start of the stimulation, ensuring that each participant did not know which session was the control session. Then Frohlich's team compared each participant's creativity score, they found participants scored an average 7.4 percentage points higher than they did during the control sessions. 'That's a pretty big difference when it comes to creativity,' Frohlich said. 'Several participants showed incredible improvements in creativity. It was a very clear effect.' 'We don't know if there are long-term safety concerns,' he said. 'We did a well-controlled, one-time study and found an acute effect.' 'Also, I have strong ethical concerns about cognitive enhancement for healthy adults, just as sports fans might have concerns about athletic enhancement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs.'",

        "text": "Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet to the head nearly two months after going missing in may 2014 . Nearly a year after North Dakota college student Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet in the head, his mother still struggles with how her shy son who liked to bowl and belonged to a club of electricity enthusiasts got mixed up in the dangerous world of illegal drugs. Tammy Sadek believes the answer is that her 20-year-old son signed his own death warrant when he agreed to become a confidential informant for police after they caught him selling marijuana. Authorities say he knew what he was getting into and agreed to help them of his own free will. Still, people who knew Sadek are shocked by what happened. 'He was a gentle soul,' said Kristi Brandt, principal of Valley City High School, from which Sadek graduated. Investigators haven't concluded whether Sadek was slain or killed himself. Adding to the mystery, a gun that fires the same caliber bullet that killed Sadek is missing from their family farm near the tiny town of Rogers. An autopsy concluded that Sadek died of the gunshot wound, and that he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. How his body ended up in the Red River has not been explained and no gun was found. An investigative report from two-and-half months ago said the drug task force which recruited Sadek acted appropriately. But his death is raising questions about the use of young, low-level drug offenders as confidential informants and if they should they be given more detailed information about the dangers. Sadek had been working with a drug task force as a confidential informant after he was caught selling marijuana on campus in 2013. \u00a0His mother, Tammy Sadek believes that he signed his death warrant when he began working for the force . The circumstances surrounding the death of Sadek, who was a second-year student at the State College of Science, still remain unknown . American Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman Jennifer Cook said informants are doing a dangerous part of law enforcement, without the training. 'The safety risks associated with informant use can far outweigh the benefits,' she said. Sadek was a second-year electrical technician student at the State College of Science, a two-year community college in the southeastern North Dakota city of Wahpeton where about 3,600 students study everything from diesel technology to performing arts. He enjoyed lake activities and golfing in addition to bowling and electrical work while growing up on the family farm. Brandt said Sadek was never a troublemaker in high school, and was always polite and respectful of authority. She doubted his nature changed much in college. 'Sometimes there are changes, but usually it's more on the level of a maturity change, not necessarily a personality change,' she said. He wanted an electrical technician master's degree, but his plans began to go awry in April 2013 when he twice sold marijuana to a confidential informant. Both transactions were small - for a total of $80 worth of drugs - but they took place on campus, making them serious felonies. In November 2013, agents with the Southeast Multi-County Agency Drug Task Force searched Sadek's dorm room and said they found a grinder containing marijuana residue. Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself . The next day, Sadek - facing the prospect of drug charges that could land him in prison for 41 years - completed paperwork to become a confidential informant. The attraction of cooperating with authorities is that it offers the chance to keep a felony off the record of a young person, said Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson. Richland County Deputy Sheriff Jason Weber, now the interim task force supervisor, won't say whether Sadek was specifically told of the dangerous nature of the work he would be doing. The document that Sadek signed to become a confidential informant did not explicitly state the potential risks. Drug investigators need to be more explicit about those dangers, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'You have to really say, \"This is the risk: You're entering a world that's dangerous, and you might end up dead,\"' Harrington said. Sadek bought drugs three times for the regional task force over the next three months, one short of the four purchases required of him. Officials have said that confidential drug informants, who are often young and low-level drug offenders, need to be more educated of the dangers that come with the job . A security camera videotaped Sadek leaving his dormitory early on May 1, 2014. He wasn't seen again. His body was found in the river about two months later. Authorities estimate that he had died two days after he disappeared. Officials with the North and South Dakota state crime bureaus and a Cass County sheriff's detective reviewed the task force's involvement with Sadek and said in their late January report that they 'did not see anything that caused concern.' 'That's how drug task forces work all over the world,' said Weber, the task force supervisor. 'You're always constantly trying to find the bigger person and go to that person's supplier.' But Tammy Sadek believes that even though the probe was billed as independent, members of the law enforcement community 'have each other's back'. She has a point, according to John Burton, a California attorney and vice president of the National Police Accountability Project. Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son . 'It's just a charade when they do these things,' Burton said of law enforcement agencies investigating one another. U.S. Justice Department guidelines state that authorities should consider the risk of harm to a potential l informant, but do not say that the person should be informed of the risks. North Dakota Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Liz Brocker declined to comment on any policies or procedures that might be in place for drug task forces in the state. Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said the use of criminal informants 'is almost entirely unregulated' across the country, though that is beginning to change. The Florida Legislature in 2009 passed 'Rachel's Law,' requiring police to adopt policies to protect informants, after 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman was shot to death in 2008 while working as an informant. That law is 'only the beginning of the protections that we need for young, vulnerable informants,' Natapoff said. Tammy Sadek believes her son was scared into becoming a confidential informant. She's started a Justice for Andrew Sadek Facebook page that has more than 3,200 likes. 'I would like to see (task forces) stop using kids,' she said. 'I know it's common, but these are just little fish.'",

        "text": "Alan Pardew will target a marquee signing this summer so his Crystal Palace side are taken seriously next season. Pardew has transformed Palace into relegation candidates to a club pushing for a top-half finish since taking charge in January. He will be active in the transfer market come the end of the season in an attempt to take the club to the next level and is keen to bring in a big name to declare the club\u2019s intentions. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is keen on bringing in a star name to boost the club's profile . Eagles boss Pardew slapped a '40 to 60 million pounds' price-tag on Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie . \u2018That is a solution to not just give us a better media standing than we have, but to also give everybody else here the recognition in terms of their value that we could attract a player of that type,\u2019 Pardew said. \u2018That is something I have thought about.\u2019 Pardew is prepared to let star winger Yannick Bolasie leave for \u2018between 40 and 60 million pounds\u2019 and would use the money to build a formidable squad. But even if that does not happen, Pardew, whose side host relegation strugglers Hull City on Saturday, is adamant that he will be backed by chairman Steve Parish. The former Newcastle boss was able to make five permanent signings in January and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens. Pardew added: \u2019To be honest, the chairman is as much banging on my door as I am his. The most important thing is we get good value.\u2019 While Palace may seek to break the \u00a37million club transfer record set with the September 2014 arrival of James McArthur from Wigan, Pardew is loath to do so lightly. Palace broke their club transfer record in September 2014 when they splashed out \u00a37m on James McArthur . 'It isn't just about the money and isn't just about the figure that you pay,' said Pardew. 'It really is about are they better than what you have. 'Therefore what is their value? And that is what you have to gauge. 'I have to say this club has done very well in the transfer market prior to me coming in. I think in that window just passed we bought really well, but really we haven't seen them. 'I haven't had to lean on Shola Ameobi, Jordon Mutch, Chungy (Lee Chung-yong) too much really. 'And I really did think, particularly in Shola, that he was going to be a massive player for us if it got close. 'In a way the team have taken that equation away.' Pardew has guided Palace out of the relegation mire since his January arrival, with the Eagles fifth in the Premier League standings on 2015's fixtures alone. Victory over Hull in Saturday's Selhurst Park clash would rubber-stamp Palace's top-flight safety, and Pardew admitted he is eager to make what experiments he can with next term in mind. 'There could be an opportunity to look for next year and that is what I am going to do between now and the end of the year,' he said. 'I will try and keep our professionalism together, but also look at Chungy and Jordon Mutch and how they are going to impact on what is a good team at the moment. 'We still have some big games though, so I have to look at that and can't be experimenting in some. 'It is about making sure whatever team goes out there is every bit as good as the team that has played in the last few weeks.' Pardew has not had to 'lean on' Shola Ameobi, Jordon Mutch and Lee Chung-yong since their arrival .",

For the state that calls itself the 'Land of Lincoln,' the timing of a ceremony Wednesday in Springfield to mark his death is awkward because Illinois faces a financial crisis and Gov. Bruce Rauner has proposed eliminating the state Historic Preservation Agency that manages sites including the tomb as it currently exists. He would roll the agency into another department. What's more, the popular tourist site was pilloried in this month's issue of National Geographic magazine as having 'all the historical character of an office lobby.' Landmark: In this Feb. 12, 2015 file photo, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner participates in ceremonies honoring President Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln tomb in Springfield, Illinois . Leader: A marker is seen over the burial site of Abraham Lincoln inside Lincoln's tomb within Oak Ridge Cemetery (November 2013 file photo) Killing: President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at a performance of the play 'Our American Cousin' in April 1865 . Recounting the route of Lincoln's funeral train to Springfield for burial, historian Adam Goodheart describes the tomb as 'a disappointment' and reconstructed in 'incongruous Art Deco style.' 'It's strange to think that there is a place where Lincoln still physically exists in the world, let alone that it's a place like this,' writes Goodheart, who is director for Washington College's Center for the American Experience in Maryland. Goodheart's publicist didn't immediately return a request for comment. The hours and days the Lincoln tomb is open have been reduced, and it's staffed with fewer employees since state lawmakers last year cut $1.1 million funding for sites in the Springfield area. On Tuesday \u2014 the 150th anniversary of John Wilkes Booth's shooting of Lincoln, although the president was pronounced dead the following day \u2014 Joan Boatz and a group of former bridge club friends found the tomb's iron door locked, despite a sign saying the site should be open at that time. Chris Wills, spokesman for the Historic Preservation Agency, said the correct times when the site is open are posted on its website. Pam VanAlstine, president of the Lincoln Monument Association, said she's deeply concerned about what more cuts might mean for the Lincoln site. 'We're all scared to death,' said VanAlstine, who also serves as a volunteer tour guide. 'We don't know how things are going to be run.' She and other supporters of how Lincoln's final resting place is presented to the public said the National Geographic portrayal was unfair.

According to the State Historic Preservation Agency, the tomb and its receiving vault have seen more than $2.5 million in recent repairs and renovations, leaving it in what Wills describes as 'excellent physical condition.' The tomb's interior plaster and paint, and bronze and marble construction were renovated last year, and its interior lighting was upgraded for approximately $730,000. The state is currently working on waterproofing the receiving vault, repairing the stone structure's interior, and landscaping to direct water away from the vault, a roughly $390,000 project. Lincoln's tomb was designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead, who won a national contest. It was dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874. Originally built on what historians describe as an 'inadequate foundation,' it was reconstructed first in 1899, and then again in 1930 to give the public access to the interior burial chamber. Today, the tomb, a circular structure topped with an obelisk, has its interior sheathed in alternating black and tan marble and is trimmed with bronze. Hallways stretch on either side of a rotunda to the family burial chamber, where Lincoln lies below an inscription 'Now He belongs to the ages.' William Sparks, a visitor to the outside of the tomb Tuesday who took an Amtrak train from Green Bay, Wisconsin, said he had a copy of the National Geographic story with him at his Springfield hotel, but disagreed with its conclusion. 'It's absolutely gorgeous,' he said of the site, even though he didn't get to see the interior of the tomb. 'I don't get (the author's take) at all. This is very impressive.'

        "text": "Manchester United have confirmed their plans to revisit the USA on pre-season this summer after agreeing to Louis van Gaal\u2019s desire to head to America rather than Asia. United\u2019s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions\u2019 Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal\u2019s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs\u00a0Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs\u00a0San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs\u00a0Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs\u00a0Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer\u2019s tournament around United\u2019s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer\u2019s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer\u2019s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven\u2019t visited since David Moyes\u2019 pre-season of 2013. Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata (left to right) hold the trophy after beating Liverpool in Miami . The squad reached the final of the 2014 International Champions Cup, but had travelled about 13,500 miles . July 24 - Manchester United 7-0 LA Galaxy (Pasadena) Attendance: 86,432 . July 26 - Manchester United 3-2 Roma (Denver) Attendance: 54, 117 . July 30 - Manchester United 0-0 Inter Milan (Washington) Attendance: 61,238 . August 2 - Manchester United 3-1 Real Madrid (Michigan) Attendance: 109,318 . August 5 - Manchester United 3-1 Liverpool (Miami) Attendance:\u00a051,014 .

According to a family friend of Chan's, the pair wed inside the chapel at Besi Prison on Nusakambangan Island on Monday with immediate family present. This comes just months after the Bali Nine ringleader proposed to his girlfriend while he was still at Kerobokan Prison in February. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan (left, pictured with Myuran Sukumaran) has married his fiance\u00a0Febyanti Herewila\u00a0at Besi Prison on Nusakambangan Island . Febyanti, known as Feby, is pictured here on Sunday before her visit to the island where Chan is being held . According to Chan's family the pair wed inside the chapel at Besi Prison on Nusakambangan Island on Monday . Febyanti (left) with Chan's brother Michael (right) accepted her now husband's marriage proposal in February . Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair. The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister. Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day. Salvation Army minister and family friend David Soper officiated the wedding. Mr Soper has also been asked by Chan to be his religious adviser in his final hours and witness his execution. Fairfax Media report that when Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo first heard Chan's request to get married, he thought it was a joke. 'There was a wish from Andrew Chan, which I thought wasn't serious and wasn't the last wish, but it turned out to be serious. He wanted to be tied in matrimony with his girlfriend,' Mr Prasetyo told detik.com. 'He's been in isolation so I thought he wasn't serious.' On Sunday Chan's final wish to spend his last days at church with his family was granted. Indonesian lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis displays a self-portrait painting made by Australian drug convict and death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran, entitled 'the second last day' Andrew Chan's mother Helen (centre) is seen here with the pair's Australian lawyer Julian McMahon (right) on Sunday .

Sukumaran's sister Brintha (centre) also look distraught ahead of her journey to visit her brother for what could be one of the last times . This week Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were served their execution notices and are set to be executed at the stroke of midnight\u00a0on Wednesday (3am AEST). Sukumaran\u00a0has requested to spend his last days before his execution painting for as long as possible, and has vowed to stare down executioners when he's dragged into the jungle. He has painted a series of haunting self-portraits over the past few days, with titles such as 'The Second Last Day' and '72 hrs just started'. They show him looking distraught, while one particularly harrowing artwork has a gaping hole in Sukumaran's heart. Meantime fellow drug smuggler Andrew Chan hopes to spend his last moments at church with his family. Myuran Sukumaran's mother\u00a0Raji visited her son on 'death island' on Monday ahead of his planned execution on Wednesday morning . With her was her other son Chintu, Myuran's brother . Lawyer Julian McMahon escorted the families of the two Bali Nine drug smugglers to see the pair . There were devastating scenes at Nusakambangan on Monday, as the pair's family and lawyer Julian McMahon visited the death row inmates. Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants during official proceedings on Saturday, saying they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Chan and Sukumaran, convicted in 2005 for their role in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were given the official 72 hours notice on Saturday. Families of both the men visited them in prison on Monday, and were told they will have to say their final goodbyes on Tuesday. Andrew Chan's mother was in tears as she boarded a ferry to 'death island' with the Bali Nine pair's Australian lawyer Julian McMahon.

        "text": "Nicola Sturgeon tonight warned Ed Miliband he will not be able to pass a Labour Budget unless he agrees to SNP demands - despite the Labour leader's claim that he would not do any deals. The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament. Mr Miliband tonight ruled out a formal deal with the resurgent Nationalists, but a vote-by-vote arrangement remains on the table. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon faced questions from a studio audience at BBC Scotland in Glasgow this evening - immediately after the three main Westminster party leaders faced off in Leeds . Miss Sturgeon's comments came just days after her predecessor Alex Salmond was caught boasting: 'I'm writing Labour's Budget.' The SNP wants to end the Tory-Lib Dem austerity programme and delay plans to balance Britain's books by spending an extra \u00a3140billion over the lifetime of the next parliament. Miss Sturgeon believes the coalition's fixed term parliaments legislation will strengthen the SNP's hand. It means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years, and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times. Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election. '[Mr Miliband] will not be able to get policies through without winning support from other parties,' she said last night in a Question Time-style programme on BBC Scotland. 'He won't get his Budget through unless he compromises.' The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament . Ms Sturgeon's remarks come after the former home secretary David Blunkett admitted that Labour could not win a majority because of the SNP surge in Scotland. He said: 'We have a situation where Labour could win literally scores of seats in England and Wales and see themselves unable to offer a majority Labour government because of what's happened in just one part of the United Kingdom.' Mr Miliband tonight insisted he would not do any deals with the SNP - and claimed he would rather not form a government than team up with Ms Sturgeon's party. The Labour leader's hopes of outright victory on May 7 have been shattered by an extraordinary surge in support for the SNP since the referendum in September saw Scots reject independence. Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking in tonight's special BBC Question Time, said he would rather not be Prime Minister than make a deal with the SNP . David Cameron, appearing on the special BBC programme first, said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority . Ms Sturgeon, who replaced Alex Salmond after the No vote, has vowed to use her gains in the election to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour administration. An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found support for the nationalists at 54 per cent while Scottish Labour had slipped to 20 per cent. Mr Miliband sought to dismiss the idea that he would be propped up by the SNP: 'We are not going to do a deal with the Scottish National Party. 'If it meant we would not be in government. then so be it. I'm not going to give in to SNP demands - whether that is on Trident or on the deficit. We do want to put forward a Labour Queen's speech.' But Ms Sturgeon said: 'If we have a big team of SNP MPs we can exercise real clout on behalf of Scotland, but we can also build alliances with others in other parts of the UK to get more progressive policies because I think Westminster needs shaken up for everybody.' She added: 'In the House of Commons now\u2026 you can defeat governments, you can change the direction of governments without bringing governments down. 'That gives the opposition parties enormous clout. 'Now I know that David Cameron and Ed Miliband are clinging to the pretence that one of the other of them is going to get a majority, but all the polls say \u2013 and everybody else knows \u2013 they're not. 'And after the votes are counted, they're frankly going to have to wake up and smell the coffee and respect the outcome of the election.' David Cameron faced a series of tough questions from the Yorkshire audience at the BBC Question Time programme hosted by David Dimbleby (left) Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a series of brutal questions over Labour's economic record - but insisted the party had not spent too much . The SNP has declared it will never support the Conservatives in a hung Parliament, but is ready to do a deal with Labour, even if it finishes in second place. It would be the first time since 1924 that a second-placed party had formed a government. Earlier this month, secret video footage of Mr Salmond raised new fears about the Nationalists holding the balance of power at Westminster after May 7. At a fundraising event in the Highlands filmed on April 13, Mr Salmond, who is bidding to return to the Commons, is heard mocking Labour after Chuka Umunna, Shadow Business Secretary, had slapped down Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and said: 'The leader of the Scottish Labour party will not be in charge of the UK budget.' Mr Salmond joked to the audience: 'But then I knew that already, because I'm writing the Labour party budget.' Mr MIliband has insisted Labour will be writing its own Budget.",

Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X . \u2018The fact I had kids caused a torrent of vitriolic abuse spouting from the thinly pursed lips of apparently \u2018better\u2019 mothers than me who thought my role in society was awful, tutting my \u2018poor, poor\u2019 children and raging about what a terrible, selfish mother I was, and how because of my job, my kids would have to endure a life of misery, bullying and shame (probably from their own kids),\u2019 she wrote. Although Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines, knew her story would one day become \u2018old news\u2019, she said she felt physically sick in the weeks following her revelation. After a stern talking to from a close friend, Ms Goff said she decided to \u2018toughen up\u2019 and start focusing on the people in her life who she thought really mattered. The mother-of-two said her harshest critics were other mothers concerned with the\u00a0\u2018life of misery\u2019 her children were expected to endure . \u2018The people who loved me knew who I was. I adored my kids, and my kids adored me. I was a good person, a good mum, a good friend.\u2019 Ms Goff said she was glad she has been able to tell her story and reveal the \u2018emotional turmoil\u2019 and \u2018torture\u2019 she faced after she outed herself as an escort. She explained that among the negativity, she also received many messages of 'kindness' and 'support'. Some even told her they were inspired to leave their mundane jobs to pursue a career in the sex industry. Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . Goff said she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been . \u2018They want to thank me for going public and making them realise it was okay to like sex, and want to get paid for it,\u2019 she said. Not only did Ms Goff receive support from those who wanted to follow in her footsteps, she was also commended for her strength and courage by women who already worked in the sex industry. While she copped a lot of flack for admitting she worked in the sex industry, Ms Goff said her job as a sex worker, was more ethical than her former career as a journalist where she was asked to hide in bushes and illegally hack phones. Discussing her personal life, Ms Goff confirmed her ex partner and the father of her children had known about her x-rated career \u2018for yonks\u2019 and although he did not support it, she had never deceived him about it. Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha (right) told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity . Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X . Hooked: Amanda Goff reveals why she decided to out herself as a high-class escort and what happened after her big secret became a global sensation . Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia last year that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity. He said: 'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on. I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.' After cutting ties with her former flame and coming out as an escort, Ms Goff said Samantha X was inundated with requests and claimed she could have pocketed a \u2018million dollars\u2019 if she'd have seen every person who inquired. However, after enduring months of public scrutiny, Ms Goff said her time as an escort was coming to an end. She said that while she would miss the extravagant lifestyle, at this stage in her life, she had become more concerned with finding a long-term partner. \u2018Samantha X is afraid of love,\u2019 she revealed. \u2018I am sick of being afraid. I am sick of sleeping alone.\u2019 If you want to learn more about Amanda Goff's story you can read about it in her tell all book\u00a0Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort.",

Palace have won six out of 10 league games since Pardew succeeded Neil Warnock at the start of the year to all but guarantee their place in the Premier League next season. The Eagles were in the bottom three when Pardew took over and their climb up the table has succeeded in easing relegation fears and subsequently boosting the profile of a manager who has yet to take charge of a club constantly vying for honours.

Pardew, pictured with Arsene Wenger, feels he could do a better job than some of his rival managers . Pardew harbours no thoughts of leaving Palace in the near future, but maintains he would acquit himself better than some of the managers currently employed by the Premier League's trophy-chasing sides. 'I look at the top teams and feel I could do that job better than I'm seeing it being done,' Pardew told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'But I'm quite happy where I am and if I work in this part of the league for the rest of my career I will be extremely happy. 'I'm really happy here - I don't really want another job,' he added.

'Mr Pellegrini's options on the bench will be significantly stronger than my own to try and get a result in the game with 15 minutes to go.

The Hornets went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following Middlesbrough's victory at Norwich on Friday. They looked as though they would have to settle for second after Matt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead against Sheffield Wednesday and on course for top spot, but Chris Maguire's stoppage-time penalty at the Goldsands Stadium denied the Cherries and left Watford on top of the pile. Craig Cathcart fired Watford into the lead with a stunning strike in the 56th minute . Birmingham goalkeeper\u00a0Darren Randolph. is powerless to stop Cathcart's sublime effort . The decisive goal at Vicarage Road came in the 56th minute when substitute Ikechi Anya crossed from the left and Cathcart sent a fine volleyed finish into the top corner past goalkeeper Darren Randolph. Despite looking good in possession going forward, it took the Hornets almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the Birmingham defence. They were unfortunate not to take the lead, though, when a fine pass from Adlene Guedioura created the opportunity for Troy Deeney who was denied by a good save with his legs by Randolph. The ball then broke for Matej Vydra, whose follow-up was deflected up and onto the crossbar. Vydra and Guedioura threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into Almen Abdi and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post. Cathcart races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the Hornets . Watford continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval. But it was a double change from manager Slavisa Jokanovic in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on Anya and Odion Ighalo for Miguel Layun and Vydra. Within two minutes, Anya had been released down the left by Deeney and the Scotland international's first-time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by Cathcart. Scotland forward\u00a0Ikechi Anya made a huge contribution when he was introduced in the 54th minute . Having gone in front, Watford missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when Almen Abdi's floated free-kick picked out the unmarked Gabriele Angella, but he headed over the top. Angella had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong, meeting an Abdi corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal-line. There was little else in the way of goalmouth action, with the drama instead coming on the south coast as Jokanovic's men were left with their destiny in their own hands.",

        "text": "(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. \"Marijuana...?\" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, \"I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing.\" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, \"You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering.\" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to \"turn around.\" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first \"Weed\" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in \"Weed 3,\" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When \"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. \"This time will be different,\" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .",

Kassab's Twitter paints a picture of their life in the city the terrorist group IS have made their headquarters, where the children cannot go to school and airstrikes hit blocks away from their apartment. The 28-year-old has a new husband, as the Islamic State does not permit unmarried foreign women to stay in Raqqa. In social media posts she boasts about her children's distaste for Kuffar (non-believers).

[sic]' she wrote in December. '#Awkward Just asked my 4yo wat she wants 2 watch.. \"Muslims killing bad ppl\" (i.e. #IS vids obv not beheading ones) LOL [sic],' she wrote in October. Kassab has also complained the 12 to 17-year-olds are now regarded as children when 'in the past they were warriors'. And during the Sydney Lindt caf\u00e9 siege in December last year she sent a series of tweets joking that it was exciting. 'This is the most excitement Sydney has seen since the 2000 Olympics!' she posted. Kassab also posts pictures of the Islamic State capital - including this of a 'double rainbow' And during the Sydney Lindt caf\u00e9 siege last year Kassab sent a series of tweets joking that it was 'exciting' 'I guess attack the coffee shop wasn't a bad idea, It's a long night\u2026 One needs caffeine and chocolate!!

The 28-year-old's father Jalal Kassab said he was worried about his grandchildren living in a war zone, but said the threat of imprisonment made it difficult for his daughter to return to Australia. 'I know she wants to come back and we are trying everything we can to bring her back,' Mr Kassab told the Herald Sun.

Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It\u2019s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate\u2019s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade.

        "text": "Surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an Indian man with a genetic disorder. The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been. It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size. Surgeons have removed the kidneys, which weighed as much as a newborn baby, from a 45-year-old man with a genetic disease. Scan shows the kidneys, which had grown to 20 times their normal size . Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed. Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records. Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year. He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted. 'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said. It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant. Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines. Normal healthy kidneys weight between\u00a0125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales) 'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.' ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood. They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure. Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones. Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops. ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Sources: NHS Choices and Polycystic Kidney Charity .",

Nicklaus was hugely impressed by Spieth's four-shot win over Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson, which saw him set 36 and 54-hole scoring records, equal the 72-hole record set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and also become the first player ever to reach 19 under par at Augusta. The 21-year-old, who was second last year, moved from fourth in the world rankings to second behind Rory McIlroy as a result and that means the world's top two players have a combined age of 46. In comparison, Mickelson is 44 and Tiger Woods 39. Jordan Spieth (left) sent a number of Augusta records tumbling on his way to winning The Masters .

Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about the young man. He's polite. He's humble. He handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion. I think Jordan Spieth is a great person - just as I think Rory McIlroy is - to carry the mantle for the game of golf. 'I am someone who likes the new generations. I always have. I think it energises the game of golf. We had Arnold's (Palmer) generation, then it came to my generation, then Tom Watson came along and right on down the line to Tiger and Rory. 'And now we have Jordan Spieth. There are some older players who have been terrific for a long time, but actually this might be time for the young guys to take over.' Spieth's mentor and fellow Texan Ben Crenshaw also paid tribute to the new champion after watching the final round from his home in Austin. 'I don't know what it is, but he just has this maturity,' Crenshaw, who missed the cut in his 44th and final consecutive Masters appearance last week, told the PGA Tour website. 'He's got an awareness of where's he going. He's got a plan. Nicklaus believes that the duo of Spieth (left) and McIlroy 'energise' the game of golf . McIlroy came fourth in The Masters, falling short in an attempt to seal a career grand slam before he turns 26 . Ben Crenshaw, Spieth's mentor, praised the maturity he displayed to become the new Masters champion . Greg Norman took to Twitter to praise Spieth and also revealed his excitement for the future of golf . 'When I look at him, I look into a future. He's a player with so much imagination. I cannot wait to watch him play the Open at St. Andrews. It's a place where you have to have so much imagination. It's going to be fun.'

'In my career, I've seen a lot of talented players squandering their abilities with the wrong attitude, with a sort of indolence. Alexis was the contrary. 'I've never seen him distracted, he was always attentive and focused, he was always ready to work harder in order to improve, to add some new trick to his natural talent.

        "text": "Grant Shapps was last night at the centre of extraordinary claims that he was doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself at the expense of his political rivals. The Tory party chairman is accused of deleting embarrassing references to his past from his own page in the online encyclopedia while putting unflattering updates on the pages of others. A furious Mr Shapps denied the claims, published by the Guardian, describing them as an \u2018extreme dirty tricks campaign\u2019. David Cameron defended Mr Shapps, saying that the party chairman is doing 'a great job' while on the campaign trail today. Scroll down for video . Grant Shapps, pictured campaigning with Esther McVey yesterday, has been accused of changing Wikipedia pages to promote himself and damage rivals . Mr Shapps has denied the allegations claiming they were part of 'an extreme dirty tricks campaign' Wikipedia has suspended an anonymous user of the site, known only as \u2018Contribsx\u2019, after finding evidence it said suggested the account was run either by Mr Shapps or under his \u2018clear direction\u2019. It cited a series of amendments made by the user to pages of the site, around one third of which involved removing embarrassing references on Mr Shapps\u2019s own page. Other changes included adding critical language to the pages of Tory Cabinet ministers including International Development Secretary Justine Greening and campaign chief Lynton Crosby. The timing and content of some of the edits appear to tally with instances when Mr Shapps clashed with the subject of the changes. The Tories described the story as \u2018completely false and defamatory\u2019. Last night Mr Shapps said: \u2018It\u2019s categorically untrue. It\u2019s absolutely nothing to do with me. It\u2019s just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.\u2019 But it emerged in 2012 that changes to Mr Shapps\u2019s Wikipedia page were made from computers in his constituency office. At the time, he said he had amended pages claiming he was \u2018a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall\u2019. A Wikipedia account using the alias 'Contribsx' edited a number of pages linked to Mr Shapps and other prominent politicians . Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits . When Mr Cameron was asked if he has 'full confidence' in Mr Shapps today, he replied: 'Grant does a great job. He has made a very clear statement about this and I have got nothing to add to that.' The Conservative chairman told the BBC: 'This is one of the most bonkers stories I think I have seen during this election campaign. Absolutely, totally without foundation. 'It seems to be based on the word of a single Wikipedia anonymous editor who, for all I know, is a Labour Party apparatchik.' An investigation by Wikipedia claimed the Contribsx account \u2018is a \u2018sockpuppet of Grant Shapps\u2019 previous accounts on Wikipedia\u2019. Sockpuppet refers to a fake online identity used \u2018for an improper purpose\u2019 and is banned on the site. Among the changes revealed include information about Miss Greening, who had disagreed with Mr Shapps over his support for a third runway at Heathrow. In September 2013 the user said she \u2018failed to vote in a critical parliamentary division about military action in Syria\u2019 as she failed to notice the division bell had sounded, despite being in the House of Commons. The user also made edits on Mr Crosby in March and August last year, at times when there were reports of splits between the two men. Mr Shapps took the blame after the 2014 Budget over a \u2018patronising\u2019 picture he tweeted about cuts in beer tax and bingo which would help \u2018hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy\u2019. Contribsx edited Mr Shapps\u2019 Wikipedia page to suggest he had unfairly taken the blame for the picture, which was the fault of Mr Crosby and Chancellor George Osborne. In September 2013, Contribsx added these passages to Justine Greening's Wikipedia entry, highlighting her opposition to the expansion of Heathrow and an embarrassing incident in the House of Commons . The user added the highlighted text about the gay marriage bill to Dominic Grieve's page . Mr Shapps's Wikipedia page stated that he had edited the site 'removing negative information', as shown in the highlighted text top image, but Contribsx changed it to cast the minister in a better light . A recent Contribsx edit, on Easter Sunday this year, changed the page of Karl Turner, the shadow attorney general, adding a reference to the Labour MP having \u2018admitted breaking House of Commons rules by sending out invitations to a \u00a345-a-head Labour party fundraising event from parliamentary email\u2019. Two weeks earlier Mr Turner had called on Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate Mr Shapps over his denials that he had continued to use the pseudonym Michael Green while he was an MP. Wikipedia is like a normal encyclopedia but its pages can be created and edited online by anyone. Volunteer administrators moderate the site and monitor changes.

It\u2019s about time we had some answers, from him and from David Cameron who appointed him to run the Tory campaign.\u2019 Liberal Democrat campaign chairman Paddy Ashdown sent a light-hearted press release that read: \u2018Grant is a wonderful guy - he is a credit to the Conservative Party, a fine sportsman and reads a book a day. We could all learn a lot from him. Quite simply, a colossus.\u2019 The press release noted that it had been \u2018edited by Wikipedia user Contribsx\u2019. Mr Shapps's own Wikipedia page was edited by Contribsx in March 2014 to shift the blame for a controversial tweet on the Budget to George Osborne and Lynton Crosby; the passage in question is pictured before and after the edit . A passage added to Vince Cable's page by Contribsx drew attention to his alleged disloyalty to Nick Clegg . The highlighted passage appeared on Labour MP Karl Turner's Wikipedia page after it was edited by Contribsx earlier this month . In a statement released last night, Mr Shapps said: 'It is untrue from start to finish, and was quite likely dreamt up by the Labour press office. Sadly it is typical of the smears coming from those who would rather not debate policy and substance.' A spokesman from Wikimedia UK, the UK charity that supports Wikipedia, told The Guardian: 'We would welcome any MPs who choose to become editors, and are happy to provide training sessions to anyone who wants to learn. 'However, the Wikipedia project is founded on trust, and anyone who tries to deceive our volunteers and readers in order to further their own ends should think very carefully about the morality of what they're doing. Eventually, the public will find out.' The Tory chairman who gave himself a false identity . Tory chairman Grant Shapps is nicknamed the Duracell bunny for his seemingly unstoppable energy and his willingness to appear on any TV show to defend the government. But it is another name \u2013 Michael Green \u2013 for which he has become infamous in recent years. Green was an alter ego that Mr Shapps used to promote get rich quick products before he became an MP. The revelation that he had used the alias even prompted a man to change his name to Michael Green by deed poll to stand against Mr Shapps in his Welwyn Hatfield seat in next month\u2019s election, in the hope of embarrassing him. Grant Shapps, pictured, created the alter ego Michael Green as part of a get-rich-quick scheme . It all adds to the perception of many of his political rivals that there is something not quite to be trusted about him. Mr Shapps, a 46-year-old father of three, was first elected in 2005. Five years later, he became a housing minister in the incoming Coalition government. Since September 2012, the qualified pilot has been Conservative Party chairman, charged with masterminding a campaign to win the 2015 general election. His supporters say he is an effective media performer; often wheeled out by party high command to defend the party\u2019s policies. As fellow Tory MP Nick Boles said: \u2018Somebody said he\u2019s the Duracell bunny of the Conservative party. I did laugh at that because it\u2019s a rather apt description.\u2019 A populist politician, who is a self-confessed fan of restaurant chain Nandos, Mr Shapps is from a different background from many others in his Cabinet, which is often perceived as being populated by public school toffs. Born in Watford, he was schooled at the local grammar school. His cousin is Mick Jones, guitarist of punk rock band The Clash. Mr Shapps\u2019 brother even played with Jones in another band, Big Audio Dynamite. Mr Shapps posted this controversial tweet after last year's Budget and was criticised for allegedly being patronising . Mr Shapps joined the Jewish youth organisation BBYO and later became its national president. At the age of 20 he was in a coma for a week after being involved in a car crash in the US. A decade later he was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but went into full remission after chemotherapy. The future Tory politician studied business and finance at Manchester Polytechnic, and upon leaving university he set up a successful printing business. Later he started writing self-help guides for a website called HowToCorp, advising people on how to get rich quick \u2013 a job which has earned him a \u2018loadsamoney\u2019 nickname. He wrote the books under an alias, Michael Green \u2013 and a photograph of him wearing a badge with the name at a US conference came to light in 2012. Last month he had to admit that despite saying he had stopped using the name on election in 2005, he was still using it in summer 2006. Three years ago, claims first came to light that he had allegedly altered his Wikipedia entries; changing sentences which he said were inaccurate \u2013 such as that he was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. It emerged that changes were made from computers in his constituency office. And some have claimed he has followed and de-followed people on Twitter to increase the number of his followers.",

The mother-of-four had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life. Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall. And in an interview with The Telegraph\u00a0on Saturday the 57-year-old revealed how close she came to suicide one day after her divorce from first husband Clive Jones. Scroll down for video . Presenter Fern Britton, who suffers from depression, has revealed how close she came to suicide following her divorce from first husband Clive Jones . The presenter and author, who has been married to her second husband TV chef Phil Vickery, 53, for fifteen years, claims she knew the marriage was never right, but remembers the time after the divorce being particularly bleak. Fern, who had three children with  Clive, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18, and has another daughter, Winifred, 13, with Phil, said: 'I remember very clearly, when they were all little and sitting around the table, all shiny-faced and having their supper, and I'd think: \"Right, you've got everything you want. Lovely! Now I'm just going to pop upstairs and kill myself.\" ' Meeting Phil whilst working on Ready, Steady, Cook was something of a salvation for the blonde, who finally came off anti-depressants last year but admits she is fully expecting to go back on them when she has another episode. Fern and husband Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary next month . The couple met on the TV food show Ready, Steady, Cook . At least now she has learned to recognise the signs, telling\u00a0Good Housekeeping this month: 'I haven\u2019t had an episode for a long time. I\u2019m cross that it\u2019s been there and that it lurks around, but I\u2019ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don\u2019t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don\u2019t trust that it will pass \u2013 but it really will.'

I'm not going to get Botox or have things done. I'm going to show my children that this is what humans do: we get older.' The keen cyclist, who starts a three-week cycle from John O'Groats to Land's End to raise money for Genesis Research Trust next week, insists that being fit is more important to her than looking younger, saying:\u00a0'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life! I am vain about being as fit as I can be \u2013 not about my wrinkles. I\u2019ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked myself out of it. I\u2019d prefer to be the woman I should be.

Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk.

He said that a visit from the party leader to the seat, which is currently held by the Lib Dems,would not 'do us any favours'. Scroll down for video . Josh Mason, who is standing in Lib Dem-held Redcar, said his own party leader Nick Clegg was 'not the most popular' But after Lib Dem HQ heard about the remarks he was forced to make an embarrassing U-turn. Mr Clegg has seen a dramatic collapse in his popularity since the heyday of the 2010 election campaign when he was lauded as being more popular than Winston Churchill. The party secured 23 per cent of the vote in the 2010 election. Since taking the Lib Dems into government and breaking his promise to scrap tuition fees, the party's poll ratings have slumped to single figures. Most Lib Dem MPs are choosing to keep Mr Clegg off their leaflets and instead campaign on local issues. Mr Mason told ITV Tyne Tees: 'I think that Nick Clegg coming to Redcar might be a little bit of a double-edged sword for us. 'He\u2019s not the most popular politician in the mainstream political circuit at the moment and I\u2019m not convinced that his presence here would actually do us many favours.' After the interview, the Lib Dems issued a 121 word statement on Mr Mason's behalf praising Mr Clegg for having 'real guts'. Mr Clegg is touring the country in a bright yellow battlebus, which stopped off in Cardiff yesterday where he campaigned with leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Kirsty Williams (pictured) Mr Mason said he was now in 'no doubt' that Mr Clegg would be 'well received' if he paid a visit. The statement said: 'Nick has shown real guts as our party leader and is someone I admire and respect. 'As Deputy Prime Minister he delivered tax cuts for low earners, more jobs and apprenticeships, and ensured real investment has come to Redcar after decades of neglect by Labour and the Tories. 'Whilst this real difference to real people\u2019s lives has not always been given a fair hearing in the mainstream political circuit, the election campaign at last gives Nick and our party a chance to be heard directly by the public. 'As such I have no doubt that if Nick now came to Redcar and met all the people who have benefited from having the Liberal Democrats in government he would be well received.'\u200e .

Mike and Susan Fortuna, of Shelburne are accusing Allergan of failing to warn of dangers, negligence and breach of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act in treating their daughter, Mandy . The parents of a Vermont woman who died last year have sued Botox maker Allergan, saying off-label treatment of her spams caused by cerebral palsy with Botox contributed to her death. Mike and Susan Fortuna, of Shelburne, sued last week, accusing Allergan of failing to warn of dangers, negligence and breach of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act in treating their 21-year-old daughter, Mandy Fortuna. In November, a Vermont jury awarded a New York family $6.75 million in their lawsuit against Allergan. Their lawyer said 7-year-old Joshua Drake developed epilepsy after getting Botox injections for his leg spasms caused by cerebral palsy. Joshua and Fortuna were treated by the same doctor,\u00a0Dr. Scott Benjamin of Burlington, Vermont. The last set of injections occurred on September 5, 2014, approximately three weeks prior to her death, according to a press release put out last week by the Fortunas' attorneys. The Fortunas claim their daughter suffered an unexplained deterioration in her health after from Dr. Benjamin. 'She was continually gagging and choking, unable to clear her secretions,' reads the complaint. 'Her breathing was shallow and Mandy had trouble holding her head up. She began to experience seizures or seizure-like spells.' The cause of death was not entirely conclusive and was ruled as atypical pneumonia, a common complication associated with Botox overdoses, according to their suit . The family obtained records from the Burlington physician, which their attorney Ray Chester says they used to determine that Mandy had received an overdose of Botox just like Joshua Drake. 'It came about seven or eight weeks too late,' Mike Fortuna told the Burlington Free Press. 'Nonetheless, we were perplexed by the whole thing. We didn't understand what had happened to her, and now we know.' Off-label: Mandy Fortuna suffered from cerebral palsy and was treated for spasms using Botox off-label . Their suit claims Botox contacted Dr. Benjamin multiple times in the 2000s and urged him to use unsafe doses of Botox for pediatric uses. In 2011, Chester and his team received what was reported to be the largest single plaintiff personal injury verdict ever awarded in the State of Virginia. That verdict was $212 million and included a $200 million punitive damages award. The case later settled for a confidential amount. According to the release, Chester's other clients range from adults who wanted to remove a few wrinkles to young children with cerebral palsy who received high dose, off-label Botox to treat spasticity. The one common thread among almost all cases is that the treatments were off-label, meaning not approved by the FDA. Allergan plead guilty to criminal off-label promotion in 2010 and paid $600 million in fines. Allergan hasn't commented on the lawsuit. Dr. Bejamin has declined to comment on the pending litigation . Allergan hasn't commented on the lawsuit.

The former England footballer\u00a0launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate. Opinion polls produced mixed results on who had 'won' the contest, with ComRes survey showing that 40 per cent of voters think David Cameron is 'most capable of leading the country', while others backed SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and others putting Ed Miliband ahead. Scroll down for videos . Leader of Ukip Nigel Farage has come under attack for his controversial comments made on the TV election debate last night . Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker labelled Mr Farage a 'd***' after claimed that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment . Mr Farage topped the list for worst and best performing leaders after his\u00a0controversial\u00a0comments\u00a0that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. The debate\u00a0spurred\u00a0a flurry of reaction from footballing stars on Twitter who came out to give their opinions on the leaders. Mr Lineker tweeted: 'Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!' He took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving.' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate, tweeting: 'Unfortunately, none of these people on that stage engage with the generation of today.' The former England player\u00a0took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate tweeting that the leaders had failed to engage with today's generation . The Match of the Day presenter launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate . Mr Miliband, whose hopes of using the debate to catapult him into Number 10 floundered last night, also came under fire. The Labour leader fell flat during the clash, and was left lost for words after being challenged on live TV by Nick Clegg to apologise for Labour crashing the economy. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell criticised the Labour leader on Twitter saying: 'I've captained a number of teams and it's clear to see Miliband is no leader.' While Mr Lineker suggested a different way to settle the debate. 'Can this please end with a penalty shoot-out. #leadersdabate.' It was the first time ever that leaders of the seven largest parties had gone head-to-head in a televised election debate . Both Mr Farage and Labour leader Ed Miliband faced criticism for their performances at the ITV debate . A BBC Spokesperson said: 'Gary has no involvement in any BBC programmes involving news, current affairs or politics. In common with other such presenters, therefore, he is able to express views on personal social media and that has no bearing on the BBC's impartiality.' In the first debate of its kind, lots were drawn in advance to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The seven party leaders clashed repeatedly on spending and the future of the NHS, as Mr Cameron bluntly told Mr Miliband: 'It's a service not a weapon.' Mr Farage launched into a controversial rant on 'health tourism', complaining about people with HIV who come to Britain in search of treatment. But Miss Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night as she accused Mr Farage of 'dangerous scaremongering' for blaming migrants for problems in the NHS. She told him he should be 'ashamed' of himself. Mr Farage caused outrage after he said that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell got stuck in to Labour leader Ed Miliband saying he was 'no leader' Mr Lineker suggested a more football-friendly way to end the debate- with a penalty shoot-out . He said: 'Here's a fact and I'm sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. 'There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. 'It's not a good place for any of them to be I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. 'They're both blaming each other and they're both right' - Ed Miliband on David Cameron and Nick Clegg. 'When he was in the Cabinet about half a million people lost their jobs so never mind zero-hours, with Ed there'd be zero jobs' - David\u00a0Cameron on Ed Miliband. 'Nigel Farage talks about 'remember history'. The Farage family were foreigners once. I'm married to a foreigner. You are married to a foreigner' - Nick\u00a0Clegg to Nigel Farage. 'What's going on here? Get real, please' - Nigel\u00a0Farage to everyone else. 'The answer is investing more in homes and public services and enforcing a decent minimum wage, not scapegoating immigrants' - Nicola Sturgeon . 'You don't have to go on voting for the lesser of two evils. That's how we ended up with the tired, failed politics that we have now' - Natalie Bennett. 'It was not Polish care workers or Estonian bar workers who caused this economic crisis - it was bankers' - Leanne Wood. 'You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to \u00a325,000 a year per patient. 'I know there are some horrible things happening in many part of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.' At the end of the historic contest, Mr Miliband said: 'You've heard from seven leaders tonight. But there's one fundamental choice. 'If I'm Prime Minister I will make sure everyone will play by the same rules. If I'm Prime Minister we will cut the deficit every year. 'I believe that when working people succeed Britain succeeds. If you believe in that too, then I ask for your vote.' Mr Cameron had the last word, after drawing the final slot, telling viewers: 'I've been your Prime Minister for the last five years and all that time I've tried to have one task in mind above all others. 'And that has been turning our economy around, putting the country back to work and clearing up the mess that was left to us.

        "text": "The city of Naypyidaw is shrouded in secrecy. It first became the capital of Myanmar a decade ago, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon (also known as Rangoon) with minimal explanation. Since then, although developed to be the size of 120 Manhattans and to have space for up to one million residents, it remains a relative ghost town. Scroll down for video . Myanmar's newly-built capital city, Naypyidaw, is shrouded in secrecy, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon . Built mainly for government staff, locals only come to live in the city, which looks more like no man's land than a booming metropolis, if they need to for work. The super-sized highways have up to 20 lanes and are built to be big enough for government SUVs, though some report that the massive roads were also constructed as runways to accommodate the landings of military. Official records state the population is just over 924,000, though any photographs taken would beg to differ. The streets are barren, with just a handful of individuals spotted walking or cycling through the secluded capital at any given point during the day. The city was developed mostly for government staff, including residential zones to house employees in four-storey apartment blocks . Despite a reported population of 924,000, the city's streets are barren and it's rare to see more than a couple of people at any given time . The building of Naypyidaw began in 2002, with it location chosen in the middle of a jungle that hadn't been lived in for more than 2,000 years. Although some government workers moved to the new capital at the beginning of 2005, many employees were separated from their families due to a lack of schools and other amenities. Split into various zones, the city keeps the government ministries far from the military area and there is also a designated commercial zone and hotel zone, despite a lack of tourism in the region. Burmese workers walk past the massive Parliament building surrounded by high gates and empty 10 lane roads . A street sweeper cleans this empty super-sized highway in the seemingly secluded capital city by hand with a broom . The residential areas are carefully organised into 1,200 four-storey apartment blocks. The roofs of the buildings are colour-coded by the jobs of their inhabitants. Despite the government-issued housing, many of the residents still live in slums. When it comes to recreational activities, there's the beautiful Uppatansanti Pagoda, which is similar in size and shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, as well as several parks and gardens, including a water fountain complex that hosts a musical light show each night. Foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit the secluded city and foreign aid workers prefer to commute daily from Yangon . But there are not many people around to enjoy the sights. Reportedly, foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit, especially amid travel agent reports that the area may be 'dangerous,' and foreign aid workers who have visited the city in an official capacity are apparently so spooked by the eerie emptiness that they prefer to commute in daily from Yangon. Despite the fact that the government set aside almost 5 acres of land each for foreign embassies and headquarters of UN missions, only the Bangladeshi embassy has moved to Naypyidaw so far.",

        "text": "Just a day after being released from jail, the man who was beaten by cops following a two-and-a-half hour chase on horseback has spoken out to detail his painful arrest. Helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30-year-old Francis Pusok more than 80 times on Thursday, after he fled his southern California home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges. In an interview with NBC 4\u00a0on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear 'This isn't over'. Scroll down for video . Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center . When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house on Thursday, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff's deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback . On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground . Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in . Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated . Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, \"When is it going to stop?\"' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday . After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been\u00a0called\u00a0to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a\u00a0puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation . However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy's alleged whispered threat of 'This isn't over' at the end of the beating. 'That concerns me because we have children together and I don't want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok's girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery . Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered 'This is not over' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating . Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell said his client's criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. 'If it wasn't for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,' Terrell said. 'That's how it rolls here, that's what goes on every single day.' Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.",

        "text": "(CNN)Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict. It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others. In court last month, she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street, staring at her own bones. Now, jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath. But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain, she said. \"I don't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this, no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life,\" she said, crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home. \"I do believe, however, that he should be held accountable for his actions. And I'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that.\" Gregory, who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying, said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories, but it's an important step. \"Everything is being brought up again full force. Our lives will never ever be the same, but I hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason, that there's a bigger plan,\" she said. \"I may be standing on one fake leg, but I'm standing here, stronger than ever, because someone tried to destroy me, and he failed.\" For Gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack, Wednesday's verdict brought a mix of emotions, from triumphant vows to move forward, to expressions of gratitude, to debate over whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. There were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in Boston. In fact, there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats. As Tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head, some survivors and victims' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears. As CNN's Alexandra Field noted from inside the courtroom, \"They've waited a long time for this.\" The family of Sean Collier, a 26-year-old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, were terrorists who \"failed monumentally\" in striking fear in people. \"While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families,\" the Collier family said in a written statement. To Richard \"Dic\" Donohue, an MBTA police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the Tsarnaevs in Watertown, the verdicts show that \"as a society, ... terrorism will not prevail, and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation.\" \"Justice has been served today,\" Donahue tweeted. Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal. She doesn't believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan, now dead, persuaded him to take part in the plot, as the defense contended. Dzhokhar, in her view, was \"all in.\" \"Obviously we are grateful for the outcome today,\" Brassard tolder reporters. \"It's not a happy occasion, but it's something that we can put one more step behind us.\" That sense of turning the page was echoed by Bruce Mendelsohn, who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line. The verdicts mean that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a \"convicted killer.\" You can't call it celebration. But there is a newfound peace of mind, at least, in and around Boston. This was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt. And they got through it by rallying around each other, a deep bond reflected in the mantra \"Boston Strong.\" That feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by Wednesday's verdict. And it's evident in people like Heather Abbott, who lost her left leg below the knee. Since then, she's become a living example of someone who wasn't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again, but to run again. \"Nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever,\" Abbott said Wednesday on Facebook. \"But at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken.\" That view was commonly shared. For those hurt -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013, Wednesday was key to their progression. But it's not the end of the road. Just ask Jeff Bauman. The picture of him, bloodied, being rushed through the streets of Boston by good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo, became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack. Even after losing both his legs, Bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life, by marrying and fathering a child. On Wednesday, Bauman said the verdict \"will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed.\" \"But it is a relief,\" he added, \"and one step closer to closure.\" CNN's Ann O'Neill and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton.\u00a0But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary \u2018pressure\u2019. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton\u2019s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: \u2018It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don\u2019t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit \u2014 we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . \u2018Other than that the lap was good\u00a0 and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.\u2019 Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should \u2018sort himself out\u2019 \u2014 a statement on Rosberg\u2019s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair\u2019s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: \u2018I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we\u2019d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. \u2018We\u2019d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn\u2019t quite there yet.\u2019 Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .",

Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana\u2019s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of \u00a350,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video . The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service . Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given \u00a350,000 by Diana when she died . The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of \u00a350,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of \u00a310 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham . Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth \u00a3266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including \u00a3100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were \"not exceeding three in number, nor \u00a37,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'.",

        "text": "(CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. \"The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,\" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. \"It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence.\" The report, \"Death Sentences and Executions 2014,\" cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its \"Strike Hard\" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. \"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. \"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\" The organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. \"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. \"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. \"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. \"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.",

        "text": "(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. \"That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror,\" Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. \"In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests,\" the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. \"But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful.\" Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. \"The timing is beyond a coincidence,\" he said. \"We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward.\" Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. \"The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA,\" he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, \"Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?\" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a \"fix\" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.",

Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disk of gas and dust around a star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system. Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disc of gas around an infant star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system . Radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million-year-old star MWC 480 to be 'brimming' with the complex carbon-based molecule methyl cyanide. Both this molecule and its simpler organic cousin hydrogen cyanide were identified in the cold outer reaches of the newly formed disc. The region can be compared with our solar system's Kuiper Belt, a realm of icy mini-worlds and comets beyond Neptune. Experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young Earth with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480.\u00a0Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive . Astronomer Dr Karin Oberg, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Massachusetts, said: 'Studies of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our sun and planets was rich in water and complex organic compounds. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy \u2013 and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington yesterday, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa.\u00a0'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' 'We now have evidence that this same chemistry exists elsewhere in the universe, in regions that could form solar systems not unlike our own.' The molecules surrounding MWC 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system's comets, she pointed out. The star, which is about twice as massive as the sun, lies in a well-studied star-forming region in the constellation Taurus. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Previously it was unclear whether complex organic molecules commonly survive the shocks and radiation levels found in a newly forming solar system . Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive. The findings, reported in the journal Nature, reveal that there is enough methyl cyanide around MWC 480 to fill all of the Earth's oceans. Among complex organic molecules, cyanides - especially methyl cyanide - are important because they contain carbon-nitrogen bonds essential for the formation of amino acids, the components of proteins. As the MWC 480 system evolves it is likely that organic molecules locked away in comets and other icy bodies will be ferried closer to the star where conditions may be suitable for life, the scientists believe. Dr Oberg added: 'From the study of exoplanets, we know our solar system isn't unique in having rocky planets and an abundance of water. 'Now we know we're not unique in organic chemistry. Once more, we have learned that we're not special. From a life in the universe point of view, this is great news.'",

        "text": "David Cameron will today warn English voters the SNP's new powers could impact their lives . David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government\u2019s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an \u2018unforeseen detrimental effect\u2019 for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it \u2018can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area\u2019. Mr Cameron will call the idea the \u2018Carlisle Principle\u2019 \u2013 named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the \u2018apartheid\u2019 between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament\u2019s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged \u2013 and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to \u2018mark the Scottish Parliament\u2019s homework\u2019 every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK \u2013 and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of \u2018English votes for English laws\u2019, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron\u2019s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year of the impact of Scottish policies, including tax rates, business levies, university tuition fees and healthcare. Mr Cameron risks the wrath of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured above) with his announcement . The Chancellor will tell MPs \u2018what action is needed to make sure there is no detriment to the rest of the country\u2019. The Prime Minister, on a campaign visit to the North West, will insist the plan will not stop the Scottish government taking the decisions it wants. \u2018In the Scottish referendum, we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament,\u2019 Mr Cameron will say. \u2018After we won that referendum, we kept our promise, and agreement was reached \u2013 for the first time \u2013 between all five of Scotland\u2019s major parties to give the Scottish Parliament extensive new powers. \u2018But as we go further in devolving powers to Scotland, we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too. \u2018Today I want to set out a new principle \u2013 you could call it the Carlisle Principle \u2013 that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution.\u2019 Boris Johnson and Sir John Major will enter the election fray this week as the Tories try to bolster their campaign. Sir John will warn of the dangers of a Labour-SNP government. The ex-premier could be deployed to speak as early as tomorrow. Later in the week, David Cameron is due to make a first high-profile campaign appearance with Mr Johnson. There are growing calls from Tory MPs for the London mayor to be \u2018weaponised\u2019. David Cameron has revealed he is locked in a high stakes battle: over ear-piercing. While contesting a general election campaign, he is also in a 'fight' with eldest daughter Nancy about when she can have her ears pierced. The Prime Minister also admitted he does not want his children to follow wife Samantha in having tattoo. In an interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said his children 'take the mickey out of me daily', including mocking his TV and music choices. 'To them I'm just a normal dad, who they think is a bit square and sometimes embarrassing. It's very sobering to come home to after a day in the office,' he said. 'They rib me about, you know, anything from my CD collection to what I watch on TV.' Nancy is due to start secondary school in September, and wants to have her ears pierced. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in that fight with Nancy at the moment. We'll probably reach an agreement over what age she can have them done. We're in negotiations.' His wife Samantha has a small tattoo of a dolphin on her right ankle, which she had done while travelling as a student. She has said it would 'fine' if her children copied her. But Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not a big fan. I love Samantha's tattoo, it's very small, very discreet. But I'd be a square dad and tell the children to think very carefully about it.'",

When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son:\u00a0'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the\u00a0realization\u00a0hit home that a total stranger was able to control the\u00a0camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York:\u00a0'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the\u00a0incident\u00a0to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled\u00a0remotely\u00a0but they could not say from\u00a0where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries\u2014it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained. 'Every place that people think is sacred and private in their home is being accessed.'",

The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the\u00a0People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (\u00a31,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (\u00a31,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village. 'The whole thing is pathetic and detestable,' said Guo Jialun, head of the\u00a0Guanyun County police station. The police is currently trying to track down Wang's real family.",

        "text": "Nasa has released the first close-up views of the north pole of dwarf planet Ceres from the Dawn spacecraft. Dawn arrived on 6 March, the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet, and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission. However, the images have not yet revealed what the mystery \u2018bright spots\u2019 on the surface of the world are, which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike. Nasa scientists in California have released new images of Ceres (shown). They were taken by the Dawn spacecraft from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km). The spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to Ceres. And it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots . The latest images were taken on 10 April from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km), and are the highest-resolution views of Ceres so far. The spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness, but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light. And it will also see Ceres in better and a higher resolution. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. It is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface. Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km). Dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first \u2018science orbit\u2019 will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May. After this, it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface. The mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between Earth and Jupiter that has yet to be explored. 'The mission is so exciting, because we're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system,' Dr Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer and mission director at JPL told MailOnline. 'For me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries, a mysterious world of rock and ice, perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds, lakes or oceans, is very exciting.' Shown above is an animation of Ceres rotating as Dawn observed its north pole. Ceres is about 2.8 times further from the sun than Earth, and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine Earth hours. Credit: Nasa . Dawn (artist's illustration shown) has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first \u2018science orbit\u2019 will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May . In the next few weeks and months, the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail. But the most impressive images will be returned in December, when Dawn starts one of its lowest science orbits. It will be at an altitude of just 225 miles (360km) above the surface - below the orbital height of the International Space Station around Earth - allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface. The primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until June 2016 - by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals -and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date, as it will probably start running out of fuel by then. This map-projected view of Ceres was created from images taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft during its initial approach to the dwarf planet, prior to being captured into orbit in March 2015. Differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest Ceres was once an active body . Perhaps of most interest, though, are the mystery bright spots on the surface. These are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on Ceres. Based on new infrared images released by Nasa the other day, it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins. They could also be towering \u2018water volcanoes\u2019, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. These images, from Dawn's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), highlight two regions on Ceres containing bright spots. The images suggest they coudl be towering \u2018water volcanoes\u2019, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this . 'The bright spots [seen in this previous Nasa image] continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles .",

        "text": "Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon has long been a fortress with no team scoring there in the Champions League for 663 minutes. Last season the now Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was the reason for that but now the man keeping the clean sheets is Jan Oblak. Sportsmail looks at the 22-year-old who has made Atletico fans forget about Courtois... and David De Gea. No one knew too much about him last season outside of Portugal and Slovenia so was it a gamble? You only have to look at his price tag to see how highly-rated he was. He cost \u20ac16million (\u00a311.5m) and that is a La Liga record for a goalkeeper. The 22-year-old was already Slovenia's number one when he left Benfica for Madrid in the summer. With experienced goalkeepers such as Petr Cech and Pepe Reina potentially available, going for a young relatively untried keeper looked a gamble but he already looks to have been money well spent. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Oblak gets down low to keep out a shot from Real Madrid's James Rodriguez in the second half . A success right from the start of the season? No. Simeone likes to ease in new signings especially when they are young and 31-year-old Miguel Moya was signed from Getafe in the close season as back-up. But the back-up became first choice because Oblak had a right hip injury in pre-season and wasn't 100 per cent when the campaign started. Moya played in the league with Oblak coming in for Champions League games but in his first match in Europe he conceded three goals from three shots. He has recovered brilliantly and now the clamour is for him to start all matches. Cristiano Ronaldo is thwarted in his attempt to open the scoring against rivals Atletico Madrid . He has convinced everyone in Madrid? Simeone's number two Mono Burgos is a big fan. The Argentine is a former Atletico keeper and although he doesn't train the goalkeepers he is convinced Atletico have found someone who can keep goal for them for years to come. Pablo Vercellone who is the club's keeping coach is just as excited and even Iker Casillas is a fan. The Real Madrid keeper said after Tuesday's game: 'He was fantastic in the first 45 minutes. We deserved more reward from all the chances we had but we didn't get it because he played so well.' Oblak put in an impressive performance for Atletico against their great rivals Madrid on Tuesday . And it really was a very special first half. Atletico have not allowed a team to get six shots on target in one half of football all season but he stopped them all.\u00a0He also made two more stops in the second half when most of the football was being played at the other end and he had to stay awake. Has he fitted into the dressing room? He speaks some English, some Portuguese, and some Spanish so he can make himself understood without problems. Still only 22 and living his first year in Spain he is predictably introverted but has a strong enough personality to impose himself on his defence. Oblak  stops Bale's attempt on goal during the Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday . Other strengths? We saw the shot stopping on Wednesday but his distribution is also a weapon for Atletico. They were camped in their own half in the first 45 minutes against Real unable to get their passing going. Oblak's long \u2013 and importantly accurate \u2013 throws and kicks forward to Mario Mandzukic were an important release. How good can he become? So good he'll be sold? Atletico have already lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea who they could only keep for one season and Courtois who they were not able to take from Chelsea. They will not want to lost Oblak and with foreign investment from the Wanda group in China the club does not have to sell it's best players \u2013 he's at Atletico for good. Atletico lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea  and Courtois but the future looks bright with Oblak .",

It has been suggested that a \u00a310m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave \u2013 and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at \u00a320m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) \u00a310m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than \u00a320m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .",

        "text": "A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being 'heartless' in court on Wednesday by angry family members. Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday . Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus . 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes on Thursday. During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013 . According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash,\u00a0WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' He . took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Records show that a Dellinger family trust owns four property in the town of Sunapee worth $3million in total.",

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

'On one occasion he grabbed a woman\u2019s head and pushed it downwards toward his crotch. 'A Single guy, drunk, we can possibly overlook, but certainly inappropriate for a Head Coach representing my university and most definitely not a married man with two children.

        "text": "A puppy tends to be a beloved addition to any family, but for a family supporting a child with autism an Assistance Dog can make a crucial difference to their happiness and stability. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and Autism Assistance Dogs are a little known but hugely beneficial form of 'animal therapy'. It turns out man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism who may otherwise struggle to talk, communicate, walk or socialise. An 'Autism Assistance Dog' is used to keep a child with autism safe and are an incredible tool to help them develop social skills and positive relationships. The term 'Autism Spectrum Disorders' (ASD) is an umbrella term that includes Autistic disorder; Asperger's and Atypical Autism. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and people may be oblivious that man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism (stock picture) Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected. They can struggle to cope with change and unfamiliar environments and routines. 'The Autism Assistance Dog (AAD) Program is designed to improve the quality of life for both the child with autism and his or her family through three key areas: safety, independence and inclusion,' according to\u00a0GuideDogs SA. Every child is unique meaning matching the right dog to their need's and their family is crucial. The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household. It has been reported by families participating in the Austism Assistance Dog Program that the companion can also foster positive interactions between siblings, encouraging play. The highly trained, specialised working dogs are licenced to accompany the child in essentially any location. 'An Austism Assistance Dog (AAD) has the same legal rights of access as a Guide or Hearing Dog. It is clearly identified by a coat which has securing points and a handle that the child can hold if appropriate or required,' according to GuideDogs SA. 'The purpose of the coat is to bring awareness to the special circumstances regarding the dog. This also increases the ease of access to public places by differentiating the status of an AAD from that of a pet.' The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household (stock picture) It can make family outings or even a quick trip to the shops possible where a child with autism may have struggled before. It can also give parents peace of mind as they know their child is being looked out for by a dog which has been specially trained to help their master avoid harm's way. The comfort of having their furry pooch by their side can offer a sense of stability for the child and be a calming presence on all members of the family. Children with autism 'have a high tendency to 'bolt' when they feel anxious or stressed. This is made even more alarming as they are often far less aware of danger and may not respond to direction. This can be a great challenge, requiring constant observance from their carer to ensure the child remains safe. 'On outings, the child's safety is enhanced by being connected to a coat on the dog's body, through a safety belt around the child's waist,' explained Guide Dogs SA. 'The parent has control of the dog through their own lead and will apply vocal commands to the dog. The child is encouraged to walk beside the dog but if they do choose to run off on their own, the dog is specially trained to quickly and calmly take control of the situation. 'The dog is trained to resist by sitting or lying down, acting as an \"anchor\",' GuideDogs SA explains. 'This gives the parent time to intervene and diffuse the situation.' However, the importance of this lesson is that, through the repetition, children's attempts to bolt are often reduced or completely eradicated. 'These dogs are a friend when you need one any hour of the day, every day of the year. 'They are also skilled for a few select tasks if you happen to need a hand\u2026 or a paw!'",
        "generated": "Autism Assistance Dogs are a little-known but highly beneficial form of animal therapy for families with children with autism.

The gang broke into an aviary and bundled 200 of the animals into sacks and containers around 3.30am on January 12.

The birds were also jammed into drawers, squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard. One resident reported that a dead bird was posted through his letterbox while others were dropped through windows. Three men and a youth have been convicted of their involvement and will be sentenced next month. Chad Worgan, from Walsall, admitted an offence of receiving stolen goods and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on the basis that he kicked a pigeon. The 19-year-old knew the animals were in the bags and had a 'sick grin across his face' as he appearing to grab one of the perched birds and visibly squeeze it, the court heard. Thomas Knox, from Bloxwich, denied the same charges. A dog belonging to Knox, also 19,\u00a0was let into the flat to terrorise the birds, it was revealed.

All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. One of the men (above) can be seen with a grin on his face during the attack . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. Bob Thomas, chairman of the bench, said their actions amounted to 'joint enterprise'. He added: 'They arrive with a dog and are seen to be carrying a variety of bags and containers. These are emptied by them and both a large number of dead and live birds are seen. 'The CCTV shows all of them entering the property together and all playing some part in the birds' suffering. 'We are satisfied that they were all aware of the contents of the bags.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The birds were stolen from an aviary in the Brownhills area in the early hours of January 12. 'They were then taken to Dolphin House where they were emptied onto the landing area of the block.' The birds were stolen from rare bird breeder Lee Williams who had built up his collection of rare jays, finches, doves, budgerigars, quails and pigeons over a number of years. In 2008, the dad-of-two considered giving up his passion after 270 animals worth \u00a34,000 were stolen. Speaking at the time, his wife Michelle said: 'This has devastated him.

        "text": "Israel's leader reacted furiously to the West\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran yesterday, warning that it would threaten his country\u2019s very survival. Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran\u2019s agreement to reduce some of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions would pave the way for Tehran to build an atomic bomb. In Iran yesterday, thousands danced in the streets to celebrate the landmark accord which could finally result in the easing of economic restrictions that have caused the price of essentials to soar and businesses to go bust. Danger:\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal will 'increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle-East' But Israel, which fears an Iranian nuclear attack, issued a series of dire warnings. Mr Netanyahu insisted that he and his Cabinet were united in \u2018strongly opposing\u2019 an agreement. \u2018This deal would legitimise Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, bolster Iran\u2019s economy and increase Iran\u2019s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,\u2019 the prime minister said. \u2018It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.\u2019 Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a \u2018historic understanding\u2019. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms. But Mr Netanyahu told President Obama in a phone call yesterday that the existing framework \u2018would threaten the survival of Israel\u2019. According to tweets from his spokesman Mark Regev, Mr Netanyahu said: \u2018The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran. The deal would legitimise Iran\u2019s illegal nuclear programme. \u2018The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved.\u2019 Historic understanding:\u00a0President Barack Obama hailed the nuclear agreement between Iran and U.S. while critics issued stark warnings . Mr Netanyahu is demanding that any final agreement must involve Iran\u2019s recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist. President Hassan Rouhani has pledged that Iran will abide by its commitments in the nuclear agreement, which ends a standoff between Western powers and Iran lasting several years. Countries involved in the so-called P5+1 talks are the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. Under the proposed terms, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges, the equipment used to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel, by two thirds, and can only enrich it enough to use for domestic power generation, not weapons. The deal also means that for the first time the Iranians will agree to have their nuclear plants inspected. And a major nuclear plant at Fordow will have to become a research lab, although one at Natanz can still carry out enrichment. Mr Obama said yesterday: \u2018This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. If Iran cheats, the world will know about it.\u2019 He said that if the deal is finalised, \u2018we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully\u2019. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted his country was not surrendering and stood to gain from the deal. After arriving home, he issued a statement saying: \u2018We have serious goals in the negotiations and eventually, based on what we have achieved so far, we believe we can reach them.\u2019",

The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, insisted on the other hand that Iran was not surrendering and stood to gain from the deal. President Barack Obama, who negotiated the agreement with Iran, hailed it as a historic understanding but faced criticism from Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US.

        "text": "Bird numbers have dramatically declined in Fukushima, research has revealed. Scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident. They found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today. Researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima (shown after the disaster in 2011). The barn swallow, for example, dropped from hundreds to dozens. This is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall. And comparing it to Chernobyl could reveal what the future holds . The research, published in the Journal of Ornithology, was carried out by scientists at the University of South Carolina including biologist Dr Tim Mousseau. They showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 March 2011. On that day, just over four years ago, Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. This led to three of the plant\u2019s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident, with several species suffering dramatic declines. One of the most hard-hit species is the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. \u2018We know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster, and just a couple of years later we're only able to find a few dozen left,\u2019 said Dr Mousseau. \u2018The declines have been really dramatic.\u2019 And while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years, the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing. \u2018The relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer, but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year,\u2019 Dr Mousseau said. \u2018So now we see this really striking drop-off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds. \u2018So both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels, even as the levels are declining.\u2019 Dr Tim Mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors, which use gamma-radiation-sensitive crystals (shown) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild . One hard-hit species was the barn swallow (stock image shown), Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure . The team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for Fukushima from the Chernobyl site, which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in Ukraine in 1986. One difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in Chernobyl, whereas it was year-round residents that were doing worse at Fukushima. This could be due to differences in DNA repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. Shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011 .",

Scroll down for video . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to\u00a013 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley was been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.",

The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album. In total more than 60 celebrities appear on the famous cover including the Fab Four themselves - but because it would have been impossible to get all of them in a room together, waxworks and cardboard cutouts were used instead. The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album . The knee-high little gnome, circled, appeared next to George Harrison's left leg on the famous album cover . Other well-known figures include writer Edgar Allen Poe, dancer Fred Astaire, comedians Laurel and Hardy and boxer Sonny Liston, poet Dylan Thomas and philosopher Karl Marx. The album cover was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper, who constructed and shot it it on March 30, 1967. John Lennon had wanted models of Jesus and Adolf Hitler to be included but his requests were denied. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was \u00a33,000 - a whopping \u00a350,000 in today's money. Following the shoot Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by The Beatles, who each signed it. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. The cardboard gnome actually came in two parts and was pinned together for the cover. Gifted to a photography assistant it was signed by all for members of the band following the shoot . It emerged for sale almost 50 years after the album was released after it was listed for auction by a private collector. Experts at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, had given the gnome a pre-sale estimate of $25,000 - around \u00a317,000 - but it ended up going to an unnamed buyer for $42,500 - or \u00a329,000. Dean Harmeyer, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that it cost \u00a33,000, equivalent to \u00a350,000 in today's money . Peter Blake (pictured) and Jann Haworth designed the iconic cover using an ink drawing by Paul McCartney as inspiration . Paul McCartney had the initial idea for the iconic cover and outlined the cover in an ink drawing. The actual designing of the cover was done by artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth. The cover\u2019s collage of famous faces includes 57 cardboard cut-out photographs (including two gnomes) and nine waxworks. They show a range of personalities from different walks of life including actors, sportsmen and scientists. The album also reflects the personal and artistic changes within the band at the time Sgt Pepper's was made. The influence of George Harrison\u2019s exploration of Indian music and philosophy through the inclusion of self-realisation gurus. The fab four themselves appear in day-glow, mock military uniforms. Paul McCartney envisioned the Sgt Peppers band as alter egos the Beatles could use to distance themselves from their previous incarnations. John Lennon requested the inclusion of Hitler and Jesus in the artwork but he was turned down. Elvis did not appear on the album cover because it was felt he was too big an icon to be included. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles. 'Among the smaller items in the foreground was this garden gnome, which appears just to the right of George's leg. 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot. 'It is an incredible Beatles artefact.'",

        "text": "(CNN)The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these: . The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal. In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). This of course is not the case. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. Again, this is not the case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. Thus, going forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to \"advise and consent.\" But the issue is not suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced.  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah.  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear Iran.  To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including Israel. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.",

A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so.

I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. \u2018But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. \u2018We\u2019re a very fast-growing party, we\u2019re increasing our attraction \u2013 it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we\u2019re not maximising our support in every potential group. \u2018And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters \u2013 we still are, we\u2019ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.\u2019 The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a \u2018tampon tax\u2019. It also said it would give \u2018absolute, full and unconditional\u2019 support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are \u2018properly resourced\u2019. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is \u2018accepted cultural practice\u2019 for some of \u2018our ethnic compatriots\u2019. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party\u2019s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on \u2018lies\u2019 and \u2018myths\u2019 spread about the party. She said: \u2018I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. \u2018There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. \u2018Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.\u2019 Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as \u2018sluts\u2019. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women\u2019s event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave. In a 2010 interview, the party leader who has often been photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer, also boasted: \u2018I\u2019ve got so many women pregnant over the years.\u2019",

        "text": "A man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $49,000 Jeep will read out a 'not sorry' apology to the company on national television tonight. In June last year,  Ashton Wood raised $18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after Jeep refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems. During a failed settlement between the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Jeep, and Mr Wood, one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an 'apology' in a national publication. However, because no one would publish the apology, he will instead read it out on the ABC's 'The Checkout' tonight. Scroll down for video . Ashton Wood issued this apology to Jeep after the car company requested he apologise for criticising them . The Queenslander launched a public campaign last year asking others to help him destroy his car in protest . Compiled by Mr Wood and the ABC's The Checkout, the apology reads: 'My personal apology to Jeep: I'm Sorry. 'Dear Jeep, I'm sorry. I'm sorry my Jeep broke down before it even left the dealership. 'I'm sorry it had 21 problems. I'm sorry it had to be towed four times. I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful for your offer of a new battery. 'I'm sorry you wouldn't offer me a replacement or refund. But most of all, I'm sorry I bought a Jeep.' Mr Wood launched a Kickstarter campaign last year in an effort to raise $22,500 - the amount Chrysler offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. He is now campaigning for the United State's Lemon laws to be introduced in Australia. Pictured: 'lemon car' drivers protest against vehicle companies who refuse to refund or replace their cars . Mr Wood's\u00a0extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems . The extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. He claims years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his car, which he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer in Queensland had proved fruitless. Despite successfully destroying his vehicle, Mr Wood - who could not afford to challenge the international car company in court - has refused to back down. Along with a number of consumer led organsiations Mr Wood is campaigning for the United States' Lemon Laws to be introduced in Australia. These included the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking . He said that Lemon Laws state 'that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked' 'Lemon is the old term which was used to mean a really bad car. In the U.S. they have had the Lemon Law's in place for about 35 years, we don't have it,' Mr Wood told Daily Mail Australia. 'They differ from state to state but in Kansas, where they have the most strict version, is states that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked. 'It's a lot clearer than Australian consumer laws which just says that the product should be fit for purpose and the dealer should do the right thing. 'I'm not done yet. I want to keep the pressure up until the government sits up and takes some responsibility and reviews this law.' Consumer laws have somewhat improved since Mr Wood's story came to the public's attention, by including a notion of 'major failure'. However, they still remain unclear about a car owner's rights when their vehicle has a number of smaller problems like Mr Wood's. After Mr Wood's car was destroyed, a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal . Along with Lemon Laws for Australia and Lemon Vehicles in Australia, Mr Wood has launched several petitions and staged a number of events campaigning for more specific laws that address the holes in the legislation. They have sent out Lemon Law stickers to hundreds of Australians with 'lemon cars' in order to 'put pressure on the government and show that the movement is gaining momentum'. A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner'. Mr Woods car was destroyed over four hours with the help of 300 people who wielded bats and sledgehammers and shot bow and arrows at it at a\u00a0demolition derby last year. More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it . A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner' 'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.' He said the 'Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot. 'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said. 'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000. Despite knowing he could make $28,000 by selling it himself, he said felt uncomfortable with the option. Mr Wood's apology can be seen in full on Thursday night at 8pm on ABC's The Checkout.

Frankie Ruttledge, from Strensall, Yorkshire, weighed 18 stone 7lbs and had struggled with her weight all her life before dieting to a svelte size 10/12. The 24-year-old, who has been a 'fat bridesmaid' three times, ditched her diet of crisps for breakfast, pork pies for lunch and frozen pizza for dinner and dropped to 12 stone in less than two years. Frankie, pictured left at her Mum's wedding in 2010, always thought of herself as the 'fat bridesmaid' however she has now lost six stone and is looking forward to her own wedding . And now the Slimming World consultant is just one year away from walking down the aisle for a fourth time - to marry the love of her life Luke Haynes, 24. Frankie said: 'I have always been bigger - as a child I was always the biggest in my class. I just ate rubbish and had a really poor diet. I ate a lot of pasties and sausage rolls. 'I didn't think I'd ever be different. But then in September 2012 my sister asked me to be her bridesmaid and I promised her I would lose weight for her wedding. 'I wanted to look good for her wedding, but I just kept getting bigger and bigger - I couldn't shift the weight. Frankie poses with her fiance Luke Haynes, the pair are planning to marry next year and Frankie hopes to wear a size ten dress . 'It wasn't until that Christmas when my Aunty said to me she was shocked at how big I was, that it actually hit home. It was a bit of a rude awakening for me. I was mortified. 'When I lost the weight I actually sent her a card to say thank you. 'The bridesmaid dress they got for me was a size 28 - I was devastated. But in the end I fitted into a size 16 dress and I felt absolutely amazing that day.' Frankie was the Bridesmaid for many weddings over the years, by 2013 though (left) she had begun to lose weight and wore a size 16 dress for her sister's wedding . Frankie looks pleased as she holds up a pair of her own shorts. She has dropped from a size 22 to a size 10/12 . Frankie, who runs three Slimming World groups, was spurred on to turn her life around after a family member made a comment about how big she had gotten. And after her sister asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding - in May 2013 - Frankie gave it her all and watched as the pounds just seemed to drop off. Frankie joined a local Slimming World group and by changing her diet, and going to Zumba and aqua fit classes at the gym, she shed an amazing five stone in the first year. Breakfast: . Nothing. Crisps and dip as a snack later . Lunch: . A pasty or pork pie . Evening Meal: . Frozen pizza or a take away and pints of cider . Breakfast: . Yoghurt, oats and fruit . Lunch: . Stir fry or a Slimming World healthy fry up . Evening: . Homemade chilli or spaghetti bolognese . Frankie was not happy with her size and was spurred on to lose the weight by an aunt who commented that she was 'shocked' at how big she had become . Frankie and Luke lark about with a pair of her old trousers, Frankie was previously a size 22 . And it took her another 12 months to budge the final stone - tipping the scales at a much slimmer 12 stone five pounds before Christmas. Frankie said: 'The weight came off quickly and I just stuck to it. And the more weight I lost, the more I wanted to go to the gym as I didn't want to have any loose skin. 'And now I am just a much healthier person. I will go out for a run or take the dog for a long walk. I still want to lose a bit more but weight loss is an ongoing journey. I still have to work hard at it. 'And my next goal is my own wedding in the summer - I can't wait to walk down the aisle as a size 10 bride. 'My mum and future mother and sister-in-law are slimming too for it so we are all doing it together. It's great for me to see how my weight loss has had an impact on so many other people.'",

The decision to ban Hardy, who last played for the Carolina Panthers, followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games . Domestic violence charges against Hardy, who signed with Dallas last month, were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify. The jury trial for Hardy had been set to begin in Charlotte after he was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill her. The league's probe, which involved numerous interviews with witnesses and experts, concluded that Hardy violated the NFL's personal conduct policy by using physical force against Holder in at least four instances. 'The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,' Goodell wrote. 'The use of physical force under the circumstances present here, against a woman substantially smaller than you and in the presence of powerful, military-style assault weapons, constitutes a significant act of violence in violation of the Personal Conduct Policy.' Hardy arrives at Mecklenburg County jail on the first day of his domestic violence appeal trail . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, was accused of assaulting Holder last May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. The five-year NFL veteran was found guilty by a district court judge in July but appealed the verdict and was allowed to have a jury trial. Prosecutors said when Holder last spoke with them in November, she told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Holder had already reached a civil settlement with Hardy, prosecutors said. Hardy may appeal the NFL's decision within three days. 'You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,' Goodell wrote. 'In that respect, you should understand that another violation of this nature may result in your banishment from the NFL.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.",

        "text": "A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood\u2019s Northampton prepared for Saturday\u2019s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints\u2019 opponents have \u2018smelt blood\u2019, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results . The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf . \u2018I don\u2019t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Some people think you\u2019re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It\u2019s a couple of per cent across the board. \u2018You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It\u2019s a combination of things and it\u2019s difficult to manage. \u2018Now there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel and we\u2019re not far off full strength. It\u2019s the home straight.\u2019 Saturday\u2019s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin\u2019s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton\u2019s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. \u2018We\u2019ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. \u2018When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We\u2019ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don\u2019t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes . \u2018We\u2019ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.\u2019 But Saints\u2019 season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season . For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,\u2019 said Monye. \u2018It\u2019s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I\u2019ve been here since I finished school and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who\u2019s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.\u2019 GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees. Will Welch and Ally Hogg return to the Newcastle back row after injury breaks. PREDICTION: Home win. LEICESTER V LONDON WELSH (SATURDAY: Welford Road, 3pm) England lock contender Graham Kitchener makes a first Tigers appearance since February, alongside Brad Thorn. Olly Barkley reclaims the Exiles\u2019 No 10 shirt and ex-Leicester flanker Ben Pienaar also starts. PREDICTION: Home win. NORTHAMPTON V SARACENS (SATURDAY: Stadium MK, 3.15pm) Courtney Lawes has been passed fit to return for Saints, while prop Salesi Ma\u2019afu comes in to reinforce the pack. Schalk Brits lines up at hooker for Saracens, but Owen Farrell and Chris Ashton are on the bench. PREDICTION: Home win. SALE v HARLEQUINS (SATURDAY: AJ Bell Stadium, 2pm) The Sharks have shifted Josh Beaumont into the second row, to allow TJ Ioane to start at No 8. Quins are still without England full back Mike Brown and have brought in George Lowe at outside centre. PREDICTION: Home win. WASPS v EXETER (SUNDAY: Ricoh Arena, 2pm) Nathan Hughes will wear No 8 for Wasps after having a suspension overturned, while Christian Wade is fit to start. Phil Dollman is out with a leg injury, so Byron McGuigan takes over at full back for Exeter. PREDICTION: Home win.",

        "text": "A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and\u00a0a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth. Doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps, despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts. While his death was not included in the review, staff at North Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which controls the two hospitals, have asked investigators to look into it. Martin Beaty, the father of Thomas, said: 'Ten deaths in eight months is sickening. But I'm not surprised. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . The report, which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at North Manchester General, found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed . 'The standard of care we received during and after Thomas died gives me zero confidence in their organisation, structure and accountability. 'I'm angry we were not informed [about the report], even if out of courtesy. It feels like they're trying to cover each other's backs. 'But I'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future.' Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Royal Oldham Hospital's new maternity unit, children's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in December 2012. The \u00a344m facility became one of three specialist Greater Manchester neonatal centres as part of a controversial \u00a3120m shake-up which saw maternity units shut in Bury, Rochdale and Salford. Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at Pennine Acute, said: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'",

Lisa Parkinson and Thomas Beaty died at Oldham Royal Hospital and North Manchester General Hospital, respectively, among the babies who died, while Lisa Parkinson and another mother died shortly after giving birth. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) issued a statement saying that they are concerned by the lack of clarity on the causes of death in some instances, and the failure to identify a root cause for all deaths within a timely manner. The trust is working to improve clinical leadership and risk management in its maternity units and is developing an action plan based on the recommendations of the investigators.",

Geraldine Alcorn, 29, of Pittsburgh, and her attorney declined to comment as they walked from a city magistrate's courtroom Wednesday. In exchange for the waiver \u2014 which means Alcorn must now stand trial on the charge or take some kind of plea bargain \u2014 Allegheny County prosecutors dropped two other misdemeanors she faced: luring a child into a vehicle and corruption of minors. Leaving court: Geraldine Alcorn, left, leaves court on Wednesday April 1, 2015, in Pittsburgh after waiving a preliminary hearing on \u00a0Wednesday on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's custody .

Obsessed teacher: Geraldine Alcorn, 28, faces multiple charges for 'obsessively' texting an 11-year-old student . Prosecutors, who also declined to comment, allege Alcorn encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even talked of adopting and running away with the girl before Alcorn resigned last month. The girl's mother, a single parent, complained to school officials after finding out Alcorn had visited the girl at their home while the mother was working. The mother then found stickers and letters from Alcorn in the girl's school binder, plus two letters the girl wrote to Alcorn with three headings: 'Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do,' ''what we can do,' and 'when we can do it,' the criminal complaint said. The girl told police she and Alcorn kept their relationship secret and, among other things, Alcorn discussed adopting the girl or taking her from her home. Alcorn had told the girl that 'they would be on the run for a while,' if Alcorn followed through on that, police said. Alcorn is not believed to have sexual feelings for the girl but allegedly told police of a 'deep love' she has for her. Pittsburgh Public Schools officials learned Feb. 13 that 'a teacher had developed an improper attachment' with a student at Pittsburgh Beechwood, a pre-K-5 school. Alcorn resigned March 2. Police said she tried to contact the girl on March 13, a Friday, when Alcorn returned to gather her personal belongings. The following Monday, police said, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint. 'The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her.' Alcorn hid her phone number on a math worksheet by telling the girl to dial numbers that had been circled, police said.

Laser expert\u00a0Patrick Priebe  created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm. And in a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away. Scroll down for video . Laser expert Patrick Priebe  built a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm (pictured lighting a match) The gadget was created by Wuppertal-based Mr Priebe, who designs and builds metal laser gadgets to order online. He posts videos to YouTube as\u00a0AnselmoFanZero. His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet/Arm are  available to order in varying wavelengths. Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. These range from the blue 405nm-type laser model to one fitted with 445nm, or 650nm. He also offers a 'low power green' version on his website. The gadgets are powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand, or both. He has previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and  a built-in laser pointer. The rechargeable watch has an LED watch module and 1,500-milliwatt laser. Earlier this year, the same German inventor built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers.

The glove was inspired by Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured) Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands, too, as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s. Mr Priebe  previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and built-in laser pointer (shown) Mr Priebe admitted  the watch was a \u2018pain in the a\u2019 to make because of all the tiny parts, and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete. The watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall . The laser watch was inspired by 1964 Bond film Goldfinger. In this scene, Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fr\u00f6be) ties James Bond (Sean Connery) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer (pictured) In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. Tony Stark's original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. \u2018That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,\u2019 said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. The American Chemical Society in Washington recently explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looked at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities . This is \u2018strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,\u2019 she said. \u2018There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn\u2019t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.\u2019 None of this would work, though, without Stark\u2019s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern.",

Mark O'Meara celebrates his winning putt in 1998 . 20 Mark O'Meara, 1998 . Aged 41, Mark O'Meara's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the PGA Tour. But O'Meara shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on Sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20-footer to beat David Duval and Fred Couples. In the manner of his great friend Tiger Woods, he drained it. And he was soon handed his green jacket by Woods in the Butler Cabin. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . 19 Billy Joe Patton, 1954 . Billy Joe Patton came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest Masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play-off with Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. But for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game, thanks to his hole-in-one on the par-three sixth on Sunday. Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two. Otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list. Billy Joe Patton hits on the 13th hole... the scene of the double-bogey which ultimately cost him victory . CLICK HERE for the second part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods... 18 Seve Ballesteros, 1983 . Seve's second Masters victory featured what he called 'the best golf of my life' over the first four holes, and one 205-yard 2-iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular. But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. An up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory, but showman Seve was having none of it and chipped in for a par four. 17 Byron Nelson, 1937 . Byron Nelson found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind Ralph Guldahl in the final round of the 1937 tournament. But his comeback was complete on the par-five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green, while his rival could only manage bogey. Lord Byron came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes, and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin. Byron Nelson and club member Alfred Bourne at the presentation ceremony in 1937 . 16 Vijay Singh, 2009 . OK, so this isn't actually during the Masters itself, but have you ever seen anything like it? The big Fijian won the green jacket in 2000 but may not have hit a finer shot than this one during the annual par-three tournament on the Wednesday before the 2009 edition. Vijay skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace. You'll need to see it to believe it. 15 Nick Faldo, 1989 . With dark descending, in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course, Nick Faldo became only the second Briton ever to win the Masters after a play-off with Scott Hoch. His nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good, but the putt was even better. Faldo recalled how his caddie, Andy Prodger, told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot, but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . Nick Faldo celebrates his brilliant putt to win the Masters in a play-off in 1989 . 14 Charl Schwartzel, 2011 . Charl Schwartzel's victory three years ago is most famous for his rip-roaring finish - four birdies in the final four holes sealed his first major title - but his start was no less incredible. After missing the first green, the South African somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie. And then, on the third, he slam-dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two. Two incredible shots, but the gods truly were smiling on Schwartzel that day. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Charl Schwartzel (right) is presented with his green jacket by Phil Mickelson in 2011 . 13 Phil Mickelson, 2004 . Phil Mickelson had long carried the burden of being known as 'the best player never to have won a major' - just ask Lee Westwood how wearisome that feels. Lefty had a string of near-misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe-to-toe with Ernie Els over the back nine at Augusta that Sunday. And it all came down to the final green as Phil the Thrill sank an 18-footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all. 12 Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 . Imagine playing in your very first Masters... and standing over a putt to win, in a sudden-death play-off. It was the first time the Masters had been decided in such a way, was played in the gathering gloom and also included Ed Sneed and the great Tom Watson. In near darkness, Zoeller held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history. 11 Louis Oosthuizen, 2012 . Some might argue that this is the best shot in Masters history - but some would also say it wasn't even the best shot of the day (see the countdown from 10-1). Whatever, it's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned, controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game. Oosthuizen catapulted himself into the lead (and an eventual play-off) with this 253-yard approach into the par-five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green. From then on, it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup. Louis Oosthuizen raises his arms and soaks it all in after holing out for an albatross at Augusta in 2012 .",

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept.

        "text": "While young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely, it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves. Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory. They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda, the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing. Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic . Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads, while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely. It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. Marie Cibot, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, who led the work, said the spread of road infrastructure in Africa was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries. She said: 'Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals, chimpanzees took into account this risk. 'More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers say the road in Sebitoli sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph. The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. However, chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely . Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely. They also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads. However, on quieter roads, adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups. The researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife. Miss Cibot, who worked on the study with Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Great Ape Conservation Project in Uganda, said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe. The team are hoping to work with the Ugandan authorities to test new safety measures. Miss Cibot said: 'These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. 'Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. 'Mitigation measures, like bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls, should be established in this area.'",

        "text": "Her neighbour\u2019s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and, says Audrey Alexander, has left parts of her garden in deep shade. What\u2019s more, it now seems likely to remain that way. Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander\u2019s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander\u2019s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: \u2018I would rather move than touch these trees.\u2019 The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked \u00a320,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked \u00a320,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed . Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made \u2018no difference\u2019. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. She added: \u2018The whole situation is appalling \u2013 the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight. \u2018It\u2019s a disgrace and I feel extremely let down.\u2019 The neighbour refused to comment. Mrs Alexander\u2019s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The situation came to a head in 2008, when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell, demolishing a neighbour\u2019s garden shed. Following the introduction of the High Hedge Act, Stirling Council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling. Dr Colin Watson, of Scothedge, a group which demands the end of \u2018high hedge tyranny\u2019, said that the council\u2019s decision was \u2018pretty crazy\u2019. A council spokesman said the decision was made \u2018after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence\u2019. Mrs Alexander said her aunt, now 87, had moved to France to enjoy \u2018sunshine and gardening\u2019. Ms Alexander called in Stirling District Council to try to solve the quarrel, but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .",

        "text": "No footballer has ever been late for kick-off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract. So, from the start, Raheem Sterling\u2019s explanation for the end of his conversations with Liverpool did not stand up. It isn\u2019t the talks that are the distraction. It is the thinking. No player is sat in an office haggling over image rights, only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door. A player may feel uncertainty about his future. His brain may whirl over where he will play next season. Liverpool? Arsenal? Abroad? Yet postponing the process to the end of the season doesn\u2019t solve that issue. If anything, it makes it worse. If Sterling wanted to stop thinking right now, he could sign his new deal or tell Liverpool to come back in a year. He has, after all, got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of \u00a3100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . So all Sterling did, the day his advisers ended negotiations until May at the earliest, was complicate his affairs. It is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks, particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with Liverpool\u2019s supporters. Without doubt, they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week\u2019s ill-conceived BBC interview. As Liverpool\u2019s hopes of a Champions League place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against Manchester United, Sterling bore the brunt of the dissent. In truth, his performance was little worse than any of his team-mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal, as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game. Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done well by Sterling. They made him a key player in last season\u2019s title near miss, got him to the World Cup. He owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks. He owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by Arsenal just days before the teams meet. Liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than \u00a35million annually. Apparently not. Sterling (left) shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . Sterling\u00a0has played in various positions this season under Rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back . Among the reasons advanced for Sterling\u2019s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers\u2019s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax\u2019s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn\u2019t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn\u2019t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn\u2019t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of \u00a3100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn\u2019t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn\u2019t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn\u2019t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder\u00a0Mathieu Flamini (right) was used a full back in Arsenal's run to the\u00a02006 Champions League final . Flamini isn\u2019t a creative in Sterling\u2019s mould - but then right wing back isn\u2019t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn\u2019t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn\u2019t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than \u00a3100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him \u2014 and that makes him worth the coin. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Emre Can (centre) has been used mainly in defence, despite being a midfielder .",

The thinker in Sterling's mind has been identified as the source of his troubles, with his brain whirling over where he will play next season. Tomorrow, Sterling will face off against Liverpool in their final game of the season at Anfield, and the outcome will undoubtedly influence his future with the club.",

        "text": "The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell\u2019s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.\u2019",

        "text": "While pounding on the treadmill day in and day out may work for some people, for others it is a torturous task that makes exercise nearly impossible to enjoy, let alone commit to. Enter 'Retrosweat'. Founded by former NIDA graduate Shannon Dooley, 30, the aerobics classes with a twist are all about 'making fitness fabulous'. Described as 'freestyle aerobic workout,'\u00a0Retrosweat\u00a0is inspired by the era of old-school VHS workouts made famous by Jane Fonda, and involves choreography to match the Eighties soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Getting physical: Shannon Dooley has founded 'Retrosweat' - an Eighties-inspired aerobics class in the style of Jane Fonda's iconic workouts . Skin and pins: Typical Retrosweat attire is all about showing off your legs in skimpy Eighties leotards . Pop it like it's hot: A Retrosweat class will have you popping, squatting and grinding to a retro soundtrack . A 50-minute workout, it has 12 dance tracks and Dooley regularly mixes up the soundtrack to keep people excited each week - and on their toes. 'There's a fusion of jogging, jumping, athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing' says Dooley. 'Basically there's a warm up, warm down, both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body. 'There will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups.' Eighties alter ego: Dooley says class goers  tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows . Iconic: Olivia Newton-John's aerobic anthem Let's Get Physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble . 'Being freestyle though, I like to change up the tracks and let people request songs, but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week.' It\u00a0also promises to have you 'sweating litres, laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for.' And according to Dooley, there's nothing else like it on the market. 'What makes it different is it's theatrical - people can come into a space that\u2019s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour,' says Dooley. 'Not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need.' And it's not just for those stuck in a Eighties time warp either. Tutti Frutti - In Summer Dooley adds 'Pineapple squat challenge' a modern take on a kettlebell workout . 'The demographic is quite wide. We have girls in their early twenties that come, ladies in their thirties, ladies in their forties who used to listen to Eighties music during high school, women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the Eighties.' 'Oh and we definitely have men come along too,  they love it.' Overall Dooley says people just like to come along because they love Eighties music, want to put an amazing costume on, feel fabulous - and release endorphins - 'It\u2019s one big healthy party!' When asked where she got her inspiration,  surprisingly it wasn't from watching her mum do Jane Fonda workouts. Diva demographic: Dooley say there's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties . 'No strangely. My mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes I watched my mum do tap exams,' says Dooley. 'She is though an amazing choreographer so that\u2019s where I get my inspiration from.' As for attire?\u00a0'I wouldn\u2019t turn away anyone who isn\u2019t in a leotard,' laughs Dooley. 'But as people come back, gradually each week they will start to build collection. A leotard from eBay, leg warmers from American Apparel and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a G-string leotard and no one will even blink.' On her own wardrobe, Dooley takes her job very seriously, admitting she's never worn the same outfit twice, 'an I've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now' - (65 leotards to be precise). Fit and fun: Dooley says unlike  treadmill workouts, Retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it's fitness . 'I like to set the standards through my face, hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves,' she says. Aside from the costumes, music and theatrics, Dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off Seventies and Nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers. 'In summer, we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track (which weighs about 2kgs) and it works just like a kettlebell, except your using the resistance of pineapple. Fonda fitspo: Dooley credits Jane Fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind Retrosweat . 'When we do Seventies class I will mix it up with a disco ball!' Dooley says the Seventies and Nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves, as well as give herself a break from Eighties decade for a bit. 'Nineties goes off, we dance to fresh prince and that classic song \u2018Sing hallelujah!\u2019 So with all this fun and flair, how does the fitness measure up? 'For me, other than getting people to smile, escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves, the best feedback I get is about fitness. People will say, I lost four kilos and I didn't even notice!' says Dooley. 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves': Dooley says those with two left feet won't have any difficulty . 'A lot of exercise these days is scientific, counting reps and scooping protein powder. I respect that but that\u2019s not me. My exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun, and I know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine,' says Dooley. 'People want variation, they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits. And the great thing about using songs is they're only 3.5-4 minutes long so there\u2019s comfort in the fact you\u2019re jumping up and down  but there's \u2018just one more chorus\u2019 and then we\u2019ll be done.' So for Dooley it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a 'bodacious body.' 'I love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds.' As for those with two left feet, Dooley says you won't have any trouble. Baby one more time: Every now and again a Seventies or Nineties class is thrown into the mix, which Dooley says 'go off' 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves. I think it's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it. So whether you've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up,  Retrosweat is all about simplicity and completely inclusive.' And it seems this 'blast from the past' class is only growing. Dooley now runs additional side business 'Dial-a-sweat' where she takes hens parties for a class, and has travelled all around Sydney from Bowral, Newport and Kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge. And with two current locations in Alexandria and Surry Hills that run weekly (and Bondi for a while), Dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things. 'I want the whole world Retrosweating, that\u2019s the plan.' 'And if I have too much make-up on and have sweat running on my face then that\u2019s all part of it.'",

Caught on camera: Police in Maryland are hunting for a 'heartless' thief (seen above on CCTV footage) who stole a four-year-old boy's wheelchair in the middle of the night. Distraught: The youngster's mother left the wheelchair in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive, Langley Park, as usual on Sunday evening since it's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment . Prince George's County Police have released a piece of surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot. They're asking anyone with information about the case to contact investigators. The film appears to show a dark-haired white male dressed in a jacket and pants. A cash reward is being offered. Commenting on the incident, Capt. Ken Humbel said: 'This family already faces challenges and shouldn't be burdened with the emotional and financial stress of the theft of this wheelchair. Flashback: The boy's mother has shared a video of her son using his chair  in a bid to trigger tip offs . 'The suspect we\u2019re looking for has no heart.' Anyone with information about the theft is being urged to call police at 301-699-2601 or Crime Solvers at 866-411-TIPS. The boy's mother has also shared a video of her son using his chair with the community in a bid to trigger tip offs. While officers search for the suspect, they're in talks with a foundation that may help find a replacement chair in the meantime. They did not say why the boy uses the wheelchair, citing privacy concerns.",

        "text": "MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain\u2019s nuclear, transport and public services after suicide pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster. And concerns are so great that one security source has warned: \u2018However much physical security you have, if someone is already in there, there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism.\u2019 MI5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas \u2013 known as \u2018insiders\u2019 \u2013 highlighted by the Germanwings disaster. Warning:\u00a0MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain\u2019s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: \u2018British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. \u2018There is no testing regarding mental health.\u2019 A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information \u2013 such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden \u2013 process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: \u2018Years ago, the emphasis was on external security. Now \u2018\u2018the insider\u2019\u2019 is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. \u2018We advise companies to look closely at their personnel. The higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment, the closer they should be monitored.\u2019",

Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing . Booked: James, Butterfield . Scorers: Gobern 38, Hudson 41, James 45, Wells 72 .

Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.",

        "text": "It is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (\u00a31.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain . 'The materials for one of these cost about a quarter, and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost. 'We compared our device to similar things already in production, and we've estimated the cost at about $2 (\u00a31.34).' The team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device, and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to Rice in their second year. 'As a team, we just want to follow the project, because we think it has a lot of potential. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said. 'We haven't really discussed yet whether we're going dedicate to making this a company, but it's something we're open to.'",

        "text": "A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper:\u00a0Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .",

        "text": "Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton got her budding presidential campaign's first targeted question about the deadly 2012 Benghazi terror attacks on Tuesday night, and her answer was the sound of one hand clapping. The bash-the-rich candidate flew first class from Boston to Washington, D.C. after wrapping up a two-day New Hampshire campaign trip. Daily Mail Online was on the flight. 'Mrs. Clinton, when are you going to start talking to the press about Benghazi?' Daily Mail Online asked her in the Washington Reagan National Airport terminal. 'Did you make mistakes?' The usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012 . DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya . WRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the scene . Moments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats. 'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said. The Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. The group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat. A special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her. TROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical Institute . On Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate \u2013 angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups . CASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in Benghazi . Four Americans lost their lives in the September 11, 2012 terror attacks, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, the first American ambassador killed while on duty since 1979. U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire. Hours later, a second wave of attacks hit a CIA annex compound nearby, killing CIA contract soldiers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both U.S. Navy SEALs. The four men came home in flag-draped caskets. Congressional Republicans want answers about Clinton's involvement in what they see as a potential cover-up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why \u2013 and how the Obama administration explained it afterward, just weeks before an election. Part of the swirling controversy involves a home-brew email server that Clinton exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state. Clinton never used an official 'state-dot-gov' email address, but told reporters on March 10 that she had given the State Department copes of 'official' emails \u2013 and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified. She deleted the rest, some 32,000 messages in all. Clinton's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators. Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, wants a neutral third-party to examine it and determine if Benghazi-related emails can be recovered. His committee said Wednesday that its report on the Benghazi attacks won't likely be finished until 2016, putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign's most hotly contested months. But the committee said in a statement that 'Secretary Clinton\u2019s decision to seek the presidency of the United States does not and will not impact the work of the committee.' Clinton's State Department infamously declined to provide her Benghazi outpost with the beefed-up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly Ansar al-Shariah attacks. She claimed later that she never saw the requests, insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk, even if they were addressed to her. FIRST CLASS: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after am 80 MPH Secret Service dash to Logan International Airport . FAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waved at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, before hitting the road to Boston for the same Washington-bound flight that Daily Mail Online flew on . In the days following the attacks, Clinton said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video made by an American \u2013 a film that insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Such protests were seen in other Muslim countries, but U.S. intelligence determined in real-time that the Benghazi attacks were well-organized and easily traced back to an Islamist terror network. Months later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Just days earlier, lawmakers disclosed that a top U.S. diplomat told them 'everyone' at the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi knew 'from the beginning' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans?' 'What difference at this point does it make?'",
        "generated": "During a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Hillary Rodham Clinton was asked about the Benghazi attacks and her response was a sound of one hand clapping, as she continued walking and said nothing. The deadly terrorist attacks, which happened in 2012, killed four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens. The group behind the attacks, Ansar al-Shariah, is an Islamist terror group. The controversy around the Benghazi attacks is still ongoing, with a special congressional committee investigating the incident and a presidential race season ahead. The episode has the potential to be a thorn in Clinton's campaign, as she was America's top diplomat at the time and may be held responsible for the events that unfolded.",

Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush\u2019s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush\u2019s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was \u2018crazy\u2019 with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova\u2019s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest:\u00a0\u2018We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.\u2019 Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of \u00a373,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years. Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than \u00a359,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.' The model has been locked up in the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga since she was extradited last May .

Hamayun Tariq, a divorced 37-year-old who was born and raised in Dudley in the West Midlands, shared four images on Twitter of a room where he claims to make devices known as IEDs. Components are seen organised on shelves and instruction manuals and bomb-making equipment neatly laid out on work surfaces in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state'. Scroll down for video . Well-equipped: British former car mechanic Hamayun Tariq - \u00a0who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper - has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria . Boastful: Components are seen organised on shelves in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state' Tariq's social media presence rarely last longer than a few days before being suspended as he specialises in posting detailed instructions on how to build bombs. Despite already doing the same on his latest account, the militant has been able to share images of his bomb-making factory, where he boastfully claims to spend time 'producing sophisticated IEDs'. Terror: Hamayun Tariq is a divorced, 37-year-old father-of-two who was born and raised in Dudley . Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their function. He clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory. After posting photographs of his 'laboratory', the jihadi wrote on Twitter: 'IEDs is my favourite weapon after Sniping, u hit the enemy & disappear in thin air just like a Ghost. Its a Must'. Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria late last year. Shortly after joining the terrorist group he began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' still living in the West to carry out deadly bomb attacks. Tariq has previously posted under various Twitter handles but he is usually suspended rarely quickly thanks to bomb-making guides and sickening calls for terror attacks in the UK. He regularly posted photographs of handwritten instructions explaining how to assemble crude explosive devices and listing the chemicals needed to create deadly poisons. Chilling: Hamayun Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their functionality . Sick: Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria last year. He soon began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' to carry out deadly bomb attacks . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren\u2019t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. Tariq's Twitter rants appear to have been in retaliation for him allegedly having his British passport revoked in 2013. One of his most widely shared messages was a sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message was page after page of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. Tariq previously claimed to have encountered up to 40 other British nationals in his first seven weeks as an ISIS fighter in Syria, according to the\u00a0Guardian, who spoke to him via Twitter's private messaging function on a now disabled account. Describing himself as 'really happy' to have joined the terror group, he reportedly added that he had also met a 'fixer' who was smuggling 1,000 new recruits into ISIS-held areas of Syria every week. He reportedly told the newspaper that he first embraced radical Islam in 2000. Tariq was arrested for fraud in Wolverhampton in 2005 but fled to Pakistan to avoid the case going to trial. He was deported back to Britain two years later and served three and a half years in prison. He claims to have left Britain immediately after his release in 2012 and moved to the Waziristan region of north west Pakistan, where he joined the local Taliban branch. Expensive: Hamayun Tariq clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory . One of Tariq's most widely shared messages was this sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message posted on this long-disabled account was a copy of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook . In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport to join the terror group in Syria. He was trained as a sniper before moving on to specialise in explosives - a subject he has been interested in since studying for a GCSE in Science in the mid-1990s. Tariq described his new life under ISIS as far more comfortable than that in Pakistan. 'Life was tough in Waziristan but here I can't believe I get a salary, I get rent. They even paid for my transport. I'm really happy here and all the guys I've met from the UK are also happy and settled,' he was quoted as saying. The Home Office would not speak about Tariq's claim that his passport had been cancelled, saying they could not comment on individual cases. However they did add that in a broader sense any individual who has conducted himself 'in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK' can have their citizenship revoked. The Home Office has said there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, although a number of experts believe the real figure is likely to greatly exceed that.",

        "text": "It is a skill employed by stand-up comedians, politicians and market traders alike \u2013 an effortless way with words that can persuade, cajole and tease. Now scientists believe they have found evidence of what may lie behind 'the gift of the gab'. Brain scans on a group of professional comedians has revealed differences in the way the brains of these 'super speakers' work while talking. The ultimate wheeler dealer, Del Boy's gift of the gab came from a difference in the way his brain worked . Compared to the less silver tongued among us, the super speakers \u2013 which also included a barrister and a radio presenter \u2013 showed less activity in a key area of the brain involved articulating and comprehending speech. This suggests that this group were putting less effort into the basic mechanics of speech, allowing them to devote more resources to what they were going to say next. Sarcasm is often described as the lowest form of wit, but it seems you need the right kind of wits in the first place to be able to recognise it. Neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic. They found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm. Stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic. Dr Joe Devlin, a neuroscientist at University College London, told the Guardian: 'The fact that they show less activity there reflects the fact that they simply find speech less effortful and I suspect part of that has to do with practice. ' The findings may also help to explain why some people dry up completely when asked to speak. Dr Devlin and his colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brains of 17 professional comedians, a radio presenter and barrister. They were asked to lie in the scanner while talking for 30 seconds on random topics without hesitation, deviation or repetition \u2013 a task based on the BBC 4 panel show Just a Minute. Among the comedians taking part were Robin Ince, who presents a show with physicist Brian Cox, Richard Herring and Helen Keen. They were compared against a control group of students, who, according to Dr Devlin, were far less adept at the task. Super speakers were found to have less activity in Broca's region of the brain, shown in the image above . Dr Devlin said: 'One of the participants was given \"Scotland\" and just said \"I've never been there\", and that was basically it. 'We asked them to speak about \"a perfect cup of tea\", topics that should've been easy for everyone. 'A lot of our interest in speaking in fluency has been about things that go wrong, such as stutters. There's been almost no interest in how speech goes right.' The study revealed that the same areas of the brain were activated when both the comedians and the students were speaking. Market traders are known for their ability to sell almost anything to anyone due to their talent for speaking . However, the comedians and other super speakers showed lower levels of activity in an area of the brain known as Broca's region. Perhaps surprisingly, some studies have shown that Broca's region is also underactive in people who stutter. Writing on his blog about being involved in the research, comedian Richard Herring said: ' I was secretly hoping they would discover that my grey matter was special in some way or had some additional little bend or section which enabled me to be so very funny. 'The testers did say that the control group of non-professional speakers found the idea of talking on a surprise subject very difficult.'",

Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago, the Gold Coast Bulletin\u00a0reports. The debts, which were due last May, include income and tax, a fine and $295,955 worth of interest. Scroll down for video . Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago . Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to liquidate ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program. The case will be heard in a Brisbane court next Friday with Pilot Partners already consenting to be liquidators if the tax office wins. Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans have reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012. Her husband remained as the sole director of the company. But Mr Evans handed directorship of ABBBC to business associate Levi Walz in January. Mr Evans is currently locked in a court battle with rival fitness guru Emily Anderson. The Gold Coast model and body builder is suing Mr Evans for $500,000 for allegedly using her money for his other businesses and failing to promote hers effectively. Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to close down ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program . Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of . Ms Anderson launched her company 'Emily Skye 30 Day 2 Shred' in February 2013 with Steven Evans as a joint director. He allegedly made contact with Ms Anderson via Facebook in 2013 to propose a business partnership, promising to 'make something' of her like he did with his wife Ashy. Ms Anderson's company is seeking damages against Mr Evans for up to $501,619 for allegedly spending the business' money on personal items and expenses relating to other businesses. One of the payments listed in the court claim includes $2,500 paid to the Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, the Gold Coast Bulletin\u00a0reported at the time. It comes after Sydney personal trainer Allie Dodds said last week that Ms Bines had used her recipes in a $100 e-book without crediting her or asking if she could publish them in a book. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012 . It comes after Ms Bines admitted in a video statement that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen . Ms Dodds\u00a0regularly published recipes for her friends and family on her Mealspiration blog before she started her business, The Sweet Sweat, in September 2013. She said\u00a0Ms Bines contacted her asking if she could share her recipes online with her Facebook fan base and she agreed. 'I thought, that was OK she's going to share a couple of my recipes, give me some credit and that was it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. But she said she was stunned when a colleague noticed her\u00a0Salmon and Cauliflower Sushi recipe in a 2012 edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book. Ms Bines admitted in a video statement that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen. She said it happened because she 'outsourced' the recipe component to an unnamed nutritionist.

        "text": "Second child: Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrives yesterday . A top executive at Goldman Sachs secretly filmed colleagues to record their \u2018sexist\u2019 behaviour when she became pregnant. Sonia Pereiro-Mendez says she was denied millions in pay and bonuses when she announced she was expecting her first child. Male colleagues at the bank were promoted ahead of her and she was \u2018mocked\u2019 and subjected to \u2018gratuitous derogatory\u2019 comments about her childcare arrangements, she alleges. So in an attempt to prove her claim, she recorded managers at the global investment firm \u2018without their knowledge\u2019, a tribunal heard yesterday. The executive director in distressed investing \u2013 which concerns companies in financial difficulties \u2013 is suing her employer for sex and maternity discrimination. She has also lodged a claim against three senior bosses \u2013 Bryan Mix, the global head of loan trading, Nicholas Pappas, who is European head of distressed trading, and Simon Morris, global head of credit trading. Yesterday Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrived with her second child for the first day of the hearing at Central London Employment Tribunal, which was told she would need breaks during proceedings to breastfeed. The hearing was not told who was recorded by Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, although they are likely to be among the 15 or so witnesses due to be called during the tribunal. The revelation was made by the bank\u2019s counsel Daniel Stilitz QC, who said: \u2018One key point is that... the claimant recorded some of the managers without their knowledge.\u2019 Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, who speaks fluent German and Spanish, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 and moved to London in 2005 after a stint in Frankfurt. But over a five-year period she claims her income took a hit because bosses \u2018felt, given her pregnancy, she was no longer a significant long-term player\u2019. Her basic salary was \u00a3250,000 in January 2010 but by January 2012 \u2013 two months after announcing her pregnancy \u2013 it had fallen to \u00a3192,000. She was also entitled to a bonus of about five per cent of the profit she generated. But in 2011 she received \u00a3200,000 rather than the \u00a3910,000 she claims she was owed. Goldman Sachs executive Sonia Pereiro-Mendez \u00a0claims after she became pregnant she was cheated out of millions of pounds . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez claims men were promoted ahead of her at the bank (pictured) while she was \u2018publicly mocked,\u2019 and subjected to \u2018gratuitous and implicitly derogatory references to her childcare arrangements' Mrs Pereiro-Mendez says her bonuses and salary were cut over five years . The following year she was paid \u00a3284,000 but says she should have got a further \u00a3475,000. By 2014 there was no bonus at all, although she says she should have been given \u00a3450,000. In her claim, she says she took \u2018exceptional measures\u2019 to perform her work during maternity leave. She would attend meetings, on one occasion asking in-laws to look after the child in a car park \u2013 enabling her to \u2018swiftly breastfeed her baby during breaks\u2019. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix all deny the allegations against them . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez has accused her former manager, Allen Ukritnukun, of excluding her from meetings, claiming he \u2018publicly mocked\u2019 her before male peers \u2018for no good reason\u2019. He also allegedly \u2018made overt sexist comments\u2019, which once amounted to \u2018explicit sexual harrassment\u2019. Mr Ukritnukun was later promoted to managing director, enabling him to become \u2018emboldened in his contemptuous conduct\u2019. Mr Ukritnukun vehemently denies the allegations made against him by Ms Pereiro-Mendez and is particularly distressed by the allegation that he made a comment which amounted to sexual harassment. She also says Mr Pappas made \u2018overtly discriminatory comments\u2019 during a business trip to Germany. Mr Morris said in a statement last month that her 2011 bonus was hit partly because of her involvement in \u2018significant losses\u2019. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix deny the allegations. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna\u2019s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair\u2019s popularity. Brookstein\u2019s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It\u2019s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair\u2019s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: \u2018Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.\u2019 Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP\u2019s salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran\u2019s Press TV and Russia Today.

To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,\u2019 he writes in The Spectator. \u2018They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don\u2019t want to talk about taxation. \u2018The deficit? Apparently if it\u2019s left alone it\u2019s just going to melt away.

And it could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago. Scroll down for video . Researchers say a fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA and dates back thousands of years, Stock photo . Study leader Joshua New, of Columbia University in New York, said: \u2018A number of spider species with potent, vertebratespecific venoms populated Africa long before hominoids and have co-existed there for tens of millions of years. \u2018Humans were at perennial, unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments. \u2018Even when not fatal, a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks, terribly exposed to dangers,\u2019 he told the Sunday Times. The research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data. Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: \u2018Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters \u2014 any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.\u2019 The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

It\u2019s good to see, we haven\u2019t come back from being behind much this season. \u2018Jones is a presence, but he\u2019s more than that he\u2019s got good feet, he was excellent when he came on. He\u2019s very important in terms of scores like this and the situation the game was in. That\u2019s when he\u2019s probably going to play his biggest part. It\u2019s his job to turn those into points for us. He could be invaluable.\u2019 All it took was a split second lapse in concentration from Bournemouth\u2019s defence and they were behind in only the sixth minute. The first half was still taking shape when Daryl Murphy was afforded time and space on the right inside the box to bring a cross under control with a lovely touch and pass into Sears to fire in first-time. The striker, formerly of West Ham, was so free he looked over to the linesman, fearing he was offside, but the flag stayed down and he notched up his 19th goal of the campaign. Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski was diving left, right and centre for the remainder of the game to keep his side ahead. Twice he denied Ryan Fraser and again a powerful effort from Matt Ritchie. But Jones was thrown on in the 79th minute and rose to meet Ritchie\u2019s left-hand side corner to finally beat the Polish keeper. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy said: \u2019They put a very, very, very expensive acquisition on. He is pretty good in the air. I\u2019ve just watched it and Tommy Smith is head-to-head with him, it\u2019s one of those you get your head on it sometimes it flies in sometimes it doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s started to pay a bit back, I\u2019d say.\u2019 Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy shakes hands with Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe before the game . Bournemouth defender Steve Cook clears the ball under pressure from Ipswich forward Sears . Cook (left) of Bournemouth contests a header with Ipswich attacker Daryl Murphy . Bialkowski pulled off his save of the match in stoppage time, making a one-handed stop at full-stretch to reach substitute Yann Kermorgant\u2019s header from another Ritchie corner. Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, but no-one is able to get a grip at the top of the Championship table. \u2018I\u2019ve not known a league change hands so much,\u2019 Howe added. \u2018I\u2019ve not known it so tight. It\u2019s crazy. I said a few weeks ago there could be plenty more twists and turns. \u2018I think everyone is hoping they can be the team which breaks away. With so few games to go now it looks unlikely. It all goes down to the team who can hold their nerve the most and who can continue to avoid the pressure of what\u2019s at stake.\u2019",

        "text": "An exotic animal owner from Ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in January. In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were 'unsafe'. Authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of  wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern Ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and  tigers - then killed himself. Apparently Hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72-year-old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure, backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie doesn't pose a threat. Scroll down for video . Feeling lost: Kenny Hetrick\u00a0is campaigning for his tigers, leopards and bears to be returned after they were seized by the state in January . They have organized car washes and handed him envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars to pay legal bills. Some spent the winter shoring up his cages with taller fences and netting, hoping the animals will return. 'He's lost without them,' said Josh Large, who lives four houses away. 'A lot of us are lost without them.' Hetrick allowed anyone to visit at no charge, getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash, as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals. He thought of himself as an educator, inviting scout troops and families to learn what they wouldn't hear at zoos. Flashback: In total six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger were taken from Hetrick's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear . However, the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed Ohio to tighten regulations on 'private zoos'. Owners are now required to have sturdy cages, background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit. Since the beginning of last year, Ohio has issued permits to 54 exotic animal enthusiasts. Others gave up their animals or moved them out of state rather than make the changes. 'I know I didn't have everything done, but I thought they'd work with me,' said Hetrick, who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he couldn't afford everything the state wanted. The agriculture department says that it tried, but that he never responded to letters sent over a span of two years with the permit application materials until last October, nine months after the deadline, when it gave him ten days to surrender his animals. State officials in January rejected his application for a permit, which includes a $1,000 fee, saying it submitted was too late. They also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside Toledo last November discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages. The inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard. 'If motivated, it would be very easy for either of those two animals to escape,' said Melissa Simmerman, assistant state veterinarian. Hetrick, whose pickup truck has 'Tiger Man' painted on the side, disputes those assertions. 'Nothing's ever got loose. Not in almost 40 years,' he said. 'Nobody's ever been bit. Nobody's been hurt.' Empty: A sign affixed to a cage at Tiger Ridge Exotics in Stony Ridge, Ohio, indicates that it is the home of Cody the bear - Cody and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in January . Lonesome: Only Chief the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law . The Ohio Department of Agriculture has a duty to protect the public's safety, spokeswoman Erica Hawkins said. 'Just because an animal's never gotten out, doesn't mean that an animal couldn't get out,' she said. Hetrick is appealing the department's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week, but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides. Until then, the ten animals - a lion named Leo that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two-hour drive away outside Columbus, in a high-security building operated by the state. 'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo\u2014a potentially life-threatening move. This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.' Source: Toledo News Now . Supporters of Hetrick believe the animals - only the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home. State officials insist they are fine. Hetrick doesn't have formal training with wild animals, but he has been around them about 60 years, since he was a ten-year-old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in Tarpon Springs, Florida. His love for wild creatures grew when he moved to Ohio. He first brought home an ocelot, often called a dwarf leopard. 'I tell people don't start with a tiger if you don't know what you're doing,' he said. He and his wife, who died four years ago, spent much of the money he made as an auto worker and police officer on the animals. Even with donations, food alone for the tigers and others cost as much as $15,000 annually in recent years. Their collection multiplied, often when others dropped off unwanted pets. His daughter, Corrina Hetrick, remembers going out to catch the school bus only to find an alligator swimming in a kiddie pool. There also was the time a black panther showed up in the back of a pickup truck. 'I didn't have cats and dogs,' she said. 'I had bears and tigers.' Even the circus camped at his two-acre property while traveling between shows. 'We had elephants in the backyard and contortionists in the living room,' she said. Erica Crawford, who has been visiting Hetrick's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children, said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place. 'There's never been a time,' she said, 'where I felt like it's not safe there.'",

Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor, who claims to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, posted a video on YouTube in an attempt to incite violent acts in Australia and New Zealand during services commemorating Anzac Day's centenary. In the video, which has since been removed after 3 News\u00a0notified authorities, Taylor instructed fellow jihadists to act out against police and soldiers. 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it.' Scroll down for video . Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor has posted a video to Youtube urging IS sympathisers to attack Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand . New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services. 'We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and, while we are unable to go into detail, we have already taken further security measures.' Police in New Zealand have confirmed they have implemented extra security measures amid growing concerns of a targeted terror attack . 'Zealanders should feel confident in attending Anzac Day events as planned, while exercising their usual vigilance in light of the current global security environment,' Mr Bush said. Prime Minister John Key told 3 News the troubling video only further confirms that IS are a growing threat to New Zealand and its people. 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand.' Mr Key told reporters that while IS enjoy 'inciting fear' by publicising the atrocities they commit, the group are under extreme scrutiny. 'Those people are under\u2026a pretty significant watch from the authorities, so we will continue to watch those people very, very closely.'

He reportedly burned his passport upon crossing the Syrian boarder and posted to Facebook that his move to Syria was a 'one-way trip, no going back', the Guardian reported. Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location in Syria to the whole world. While some claimed he did this unknowingly branding him the 'bumbling jihadi', Taylor said he had 'every intention' to display his location.

Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location to the world . This comes only weeks after an Anzac Day terror plot was foiled by Australian authorities when 200 officers raided properties in south east Melbourne. Five men were arrested and it was revealed they were allegedly plotting to run over a police officer, savage him with a knife and steal his gun so they could embark on a shooting rampage in the streets of Melbourne on Anzac Day. Two of the five men arrested in the pre-dawn raids remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, was being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. A British teenager was also arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during Anzac Day commemorations. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire, allegedly communicated with Australian men who had planned to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. Police said the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after they intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested  on suspicion that he was instigating a beheading, again on Australian soil. The Australian Federal Police confirmed the 14-year-old's arrest was linked to counter terrorism operations in Australia. Five men were arrested in anti-terror raids in Melbourne, after the culmination of a month-long operation code-named Operation Rising .",

It found Alpha Delta responsible for causing harm to pledges and violating terms of a suspension for alcohol violations. The fraternity has until next Monday to appeal the decision. Alpha Delta President Ryan Maguire said members are disappointed and exploring options. Booted out:\u00a0A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' Alpha Delta after several pledges\u00a0received brands on their backsides . Regardless of the outcome of an appeal, Inge-Lise Ameer, interim dean, has the authority to withdraw recognition of Alpha Delta. She's taken evidence from the committee under advisement. Attorney George Ostler said last month Alpha Delta acknowledged a small group of members voluntarily chose to get brands on their backsides, but said the practice - which he compared to a form of self-expression akin to piercing and tattoos - was never a condition of membership and has since stopped. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a whistleblower. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker first reported last month. Toga! The 46-year-old Greek organization partly inspired the 1978 National Lampoon's Animal House starring John Belushi (pictured center) He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. Making changes:\u00a0Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced this year a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future . A 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'. Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity. The Greek organization has received bad publicity over the past four years. In 2011, two students were hurt when they plummeted from the roof of the Alpha Delta house, reported Valley News. Two years later, the notorious frat was indicted for serving alcohol to minors. That same year, Alpha Delta was force to issue an apology for organizing a 'Bloods and Crips' themed party. Then in October 2014, Alpha Delta was suspended for committing alcohol violations. Earlier this year, Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future that included high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus. The college is banning hard liquor on campus, ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing, developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities. Alpha Delta was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity in 1969.",

Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season despite starting the campaign as third-choice striker, netting 30 goals in all competitions for the club while also scoring on his senior England debut. It's been a memorable breakthrough year for Kane, who spent time on loan at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City before breaking into the Spurs first-team under boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Kane came through the White Hart Lane club's youth ranks and he made his Premier League debut for Spurs during the 2012-13 season but it wasn't until this season that he broke into the first-team. He struck a free-kick winner from the bench at Aston Villa in early November and was then given a run of games by Mauricio Pochettino, with fellow frontmen Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor failing to deliver. And he has not looked back since. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award.

Never doubting himself, had he been told 12 months ago this was his destiny, Kane said: 'I'd have said let's do it - let's get it on. 'A lot has changed since then but I have always believed in my ability and have been waiting for a chance to express myself. I didn't think it would go as quickly as it has done but I have managed to ride the wave and the season has got better and better.

Asked for his favourite moment, Kane said: 'Making my England debut and getting that goal - it was a very proud moment. It made it even more special. 'For a footballer, to represent their country is the pinnacle, and I'm very proud. I was able to do that and it was a moment I won't forget.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino tipped the Chingford-born forward for even bigger things after he scored in the recent 3-1 win at Newcastle, to become the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to reach 30 club goals in a season. Kane beat off stiff competition from Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (pictured) to win the award .

        "text": "Damon Albarn said modern pop stars are part of a 'selfie generation' that just sings about platitudes . He was once the driving force behind Britpop in the 1990s and became known for his very public spat with Oasis' Gallagher brothers. And now Blur frontman Damon Albarn, who lives in Kensington and Chelsea in London, has returned to pick a fight with even more people in the music industry. Albarn has criticised today's pop stars for 'talking platitudes' and singing only about themselves, at a time when, he believes, they could be using their music to make political statements in the run up to the general election. The 47-year-old dubbed modern pop artists as existing in a 'selfie generation' of stars who use their music to reveal only how they feel. 'Modern day musicians are talking platitudes now and it's not interesting to me,' Albarn told the Sunday Times' Culture magazine. His comments are timely as Blur releases its first album in years this month. Albarn's criticisms are also likely to resonate with people who have been scornful about the work of modern day pop stars such as Taylor Swift and Sam Smith who are known for using their singles to express their emotions about failed relationships. 'What are any of them saying?' added Albarn, now a father-of-one. 'I don't hear them saying anything other than \"This is me and this is how I feel,\" which is an important part of songwriting, but we're talking in the context of an election.' Blur shot to success with Parklife in 1995 - widely seen as a commentary about growing up in the 1990s and the ordinary people that many forgot about. They became one of the best known bands in pop, fuelled by a very public row with rivals Oasis. But by 2002 Graham Coxon - best friend of Albarn - was asked to leave the band and they all began to do their own projects. In 2009 they reunited to play Hyde Park and again in 2012. Sam Smith,recently credited the man who broke his heart for inspiring his award winning album . Taylor Swift is known for using her music to criticise her ex-boyfriends and reveal her struggles in love . Albarn said he would like to see popstars talking about what is going on around them and using their music to comment on modern society and politics. He is characteristically forthright about his own political stance. The Blur frontman longs to see a Labour and Green party government, and dismisses an incident in the 1990s when Tony Blair tried to recruit him as an incident when he was young and new to politics, and still did not know his own political mind. He would also like to see Trident significantly reduced. Alex James (left), Dave Rowntree (centre, top), guitarist Graham Coxon (right) and Damon Albarn (centre front) were one of the best known boybands in the 1990s and have reunited to produced a new album . Blur release their new album The Magic Whip later this month. It is the first time since the 1999 album, entitled 13, that Graham Coxon will feature fully on the album. Magic Whip was created in two sections - the first after they reunited to play in Hyde Park in 2009 and went on a world tour - finding time in Hong Kong to come up with some new material. Coxon worked on the songs and they returned to Hong Kong again to complete the album.",

Carrick has enjoyed a renaissance this season as Louis van Gaal's side put their stuttering start to the season behind them and carved out a place in the Champions League places. The former West Ham and Tottenham star, now 34, is not planning to hang up his boots any time soon, but when he does he says he'd like to try his hand behind the wheel of an F1 car. Michael Carrick celebrates after Manchester United score, and hopes to be playing for many more years . Carrick revealed that, when he finally hangs up his boots, he wants to try his hand at Formula One . He told MUTV: 'I wouldn't swap football for anything... except maybe to be an F1 driver. 'I'd love to have a go. I love the sport, I'm a massive fan. I've done a few track days and enjoyed that, but there's nothing like going to watch F1. I'm hooked on it. 'Football is work and it's a lot more than that too. But it's about getting balance in your life as you get older. 'At 33 or 34, that's when you're not sure how your body is going to react. 'Living right and trying to look after myself gives me a better chance. I feel as good and as a fit as I ever have. 'I'm not saying I can last as long as Giggsy (Ryan Giggs). Not many people, if anyone, can do what he did. But I tried to learn off Giggsy, Scholesy (Paul Scholes) and Gaz Nev (Gary Neville). Carrick talks to United assistant Ryan Giggs, and says he wants to emulate the legend's longevity . Carrick applauds the Old Trafford fans, as he tries to find ways to keep at the top of his game, despite his age . 'It's stuff in the gym, yoga, living right, eating right... it all comes together and hopefully gives you a chance of playing for that extra couple of years.' The 34-year-old midfielder, who started his professional career at West Ham, admits moving to London from his family home in the north east at the age of 15 was one of the biggest challenges he ever faced. 'Moving to London at 15 was a struggle, but the best thing I ever did,' he said. The first three or four months were tough. Carrick (right) moved to West Ham as a 15-year-old, and says it forced him to grow up fast . 'The football was great, but when you were going back [to where you were staying] you didn't have someone there. You didn't have a mobile phone back then, it was a case of going to the phone box [to call home]. 'Things like that now you take for granted but then it was a big deal. But it helped me grow. It shaped me a lot faster than if I'd stayed in Newcastle and been pampered.' Watch Carrick: Life Before United on MUTV (Tuesday 14:00, 21:30, Wednesday 09:30, 18:00).",

Doctors say they are stunned with how healthy Luke Shambrook appeared, considering he had gone without food or water since Good Friday. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy is seen flanked by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne . Luke is with his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' she said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne . A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.'

A grinning Ri Sol-Ju, wearing what appeared to be a wedding ring on her left hand, was pictured clapping next to her smiling husband Kim Jong-un during a men's football match at Kim Il Sung Stadium on Monday, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. Scroll down for video . Laughing with her husband, Kim Jong-un, as the pair watch a celebratory football match, Ri Sol-Ju is seen for the first time since December . The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events in a break from the past, when the North's first ladies were kept out of the limelight. She was pictured wearing stylish, expensive-looking outfits and on one occasion sported what appeared to be a Christian Dior handbag, in a country plagued by chronic poverty. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events . But Ri has been out of the spotlight since December for unknown reasons. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated state for nearly seven decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un. KCNA said 'an endless stream of people' was visiting, Mangyongdae, the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, as the 'Day of the Sun' draws near. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media . On Sunday more than 800 runners took place in an international marathon watched by hundreds of fans, including some 600 from abroad, as part of the celebrations. 'Attending the race were more than 600 marathon fans from dozens of countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Finland, UK and Italy,' KCNA said. The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa. But it last month reversed a ban on foreigners taking part in the annual run, after lifting strict travel restrictions aimed at keeping out the Ebola virus. Ri Sol-ju here is seen wearing a wedding ring and her husband Kim Jong-un an expensive watch. \u00a0Last week he appeared to be wearing a bandage on the same wrist after sustaining an injury.

        "text": "Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been warned he risks creating a lost generation of supporters if he fails to invest in the club. Thousands of fans stayed away from Sunday's Barclays Premier League defeat by Tottenham at St James' Park in protest at the way the sportswear Tycoon is running the club, with the official attendance of 47,427 - the capacity of the stadium is in excess of 52,000 - understood to include many season ticket holders who did not attend. Protesters are calling for a repeat when Swansea head for Tyneside on Saturday, but Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine www.themag.co.uk, fears longer-term consequences. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been urged to invest in the club or risk losing a generation of fans . Newcastle fans hold up 'Ashley Out' banners, mocked in the style of his Sports Direct chain of stores . Thousands of Newcastle fans boycotted the club's last game, a 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs on Sunday . Jensen, who himself stayed away from Sunday's game, said: 'I feel sorry for young people, what they are watching now and this lack of ambition. At least when I was young, the team might have been rubbish and we were going nowhere, but it was exciting to be on the terraces. 'There was so much more wrapped up in it, whereas now if the football is rubbish, I'm not quite sure what the lure is. 'That's a long-term danger. Whether Mike Ashley is here in the future or not, there's a danger that you are turning all these people off Newcastle United and going to the match, especially with the rival attraction of being able to watch it in your local pub.' Unofficial estimates have put the actual attendance for the 3-1 defeat by Spurs at significantly lower than 47,000, although some have seemed wildly optimistic. However, there is little doubt that those who answered calls for a boycott made an impact. Jensen said: 'I thought it was a massive success. Comparing it with the walk-out at the end of last season, basically it's always going to be symbolic. 'It's not going to bring Mike Ashley to his knees, but to have thousands and thousands of people, or whatever figure you want to put on it, who have already paid for something not going to the match... 'Imagine thousands of people going to Tesco or Sainsbury's and buying \u00a330 worth of shopping and saying, 'Hang on a second, I'm not happy, you can have your shopping back'. It's a massive statement.' Last week's revelation that the club banked in excess of \u00a334million as well as recording a profit of \u00a318.7million for the last financial year has simply served to increase anger among fans, who have seen a squad assembled on a budget struggle to compete during the second half of the current campaign, and not for the first time in recent years. Tottenham striker Harry Kane nets his 20th league goal of the season to round off a 3-1 win over Newcastle . A fan holds up a sign protesting against Ashley's ownership as Newcastle slump to a sixth straight defeat . Newcastle midfielder Remy Cabella (left) jostles for possession with Tottenham's Paulinho (right) on Sunday . They have not been placated by head coach John Carver's insistence that there will be investment during the summer, and an increasingly vocal lobby are demanding that Ashley sells up. Jensen said: 'When you see the benefits that he's getting, as well as now profits in each of the last four years and the way that the TV income is going, to those people who say, 'Why isn't there a buyer? There isn't one' - why wouldn't there be a buyer? 'The climate of Premier League football has totally changed due to these TV deals, and so if you have got a sustainable Premier League club, especially one with the third biggest attendances, at the right price - and with a willing seller - there is definitely a buyer out there.' In the meantime, Carver faces the task of attempting to end a run of six successive league defeats, which has left the club just seven points clear of the drop zone, against the Swans. He said: 'I think there's enough experience to deal with it, yes. But we have got to stop losing players, though, sendings-off, injury...' Newcastle fans point towards the club's rude financial health amid poor performances on the pitch .",

        "text": "Mothers across the globe have been left outraged by an alleged religious community that is criticizing moms for having cesarean sections instead of natural childbirths \u2013 creating a series of insulting campaign images, or memes, that claim they 'didn't really give birth'. The Facebook page of the so-called\u00a0Disciples of the New Dawn\u00a0has sparked an internet firestorm as thousands of mothers share, and comment on, the group's anti-cesarean memes, expressing their disgust at the outrageous messages they express; the community, led by Father Patrick Embry, is using the images to encourage fellow Christians to shame 'lazy' and 'negligent' mothers who have elected to undergo C-sections. 'Face the facts: You didn't really give birth. You caught a lucky break. Please show respect to superior women who actually had what it took to get the job done,' reads one of the group's Facebook memes, which has been shared nearly 80,000 times since it was posted on Sunday. Alarming message: This controversial anti-cesarean meme posted on the Disciples of the New Dawn's Facebook page on Sunday has been shared nearly 80,000 times . Propaganda: The religious community claims women will be 'cast into the lake of fire' if they undergo a C-section . 'Good advice from Matriarch Graber on behalf of The Circle of Matriarchs,' the Disciples of the New Dawn captioned the\u00a0controversial image featuring a woman's C-section scar. The post continued: 'They have delivered many babies over the years, NATURALLY and not once has needed a C-Section or pharmaceutical toxins. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing as it is the zenith of a woman's role in a moral Christian society. If God has decided to call you home, it is not up to you or a doctor to reject Him. You may find yourself cast into the lake of fire for doing so. God's Peace [sic].' Although some reporters claimed to have spoken with Mr Embry, many question the existence of the extreme religious community and the validity of its messages. And while it remains unclear as to whether or not the page was created with the sole intention of inciting fury, its most recent postings have taken the internet by storm. Not scientific: This meme alleges that women who avoid vaccination are 'more likely' to have a natural vaginal birth . Public shaming: This meme featuring a mom in a bikini states that women shouldn't flaunt their stomachs after having cesarean sections because they didn't take care of themselves while they were pregnant . Scare tactics: The community added this picture caption to the meme to remind women that God is always 'watching' and 'judging' Thousands of women are sharing their stories and reasons for undergoing C-sections in the comment sections of the images, which claim there is 'no medical need' for\u00a0cesareans. 'I am proud to have had a C-section! I was in labor for 3 days,' Barri Lynne Thomas wrote today. 'We found out my baby was stuck on my pelvis face up! If they would have simply moved her giving birth naturally I could have killed her! [sic]' Sara Jane Schwarz asked: 'How is it a lucky break? Getting a C-section means that the baby's and or the mother's life is in danger.' She continued: 'Birth is a miracle. It should not be played down or slandered like this group has done. It's a disgrace to women everywhere for this group to post such a hurtful and tactless post. It doesn't matter how one gives birth. All that matters is that there is birth of new life and everyone is safe and healthy.' Not true: This controversial meme claims that women who have C-sections 'do so because of decades of drug abuse and alcohol dependence' Unfair claims: The Disciples of the New Dawn also believe that there is 'no medial need' for cesarean sections when giving birth . Outrageous accusation: The group called women who have C-sections 'lazy' parents . 'Ignorance is bliss. May God forgive your stupidity,' Wendy Comfort added. And\u00a0Cassie Wallace noted: '8,304 ppl LIKED THIS POST? See, to me, that's the scariest part... [sic]' Meanwhile, others are breathing new life into old petitions looking to remove the group's page from Facebook because of its history of 'severe hate speech' and 'sexism'. 2,500 new supporters have joined one online petition on Change.org today. 'I am signing this because of the hatred and condemnation they give to mothers who were not able to have a 'natural vaginal' birth and they are saying anyone who did not have this type of birth was due to drugs or 'being a little w****,' one woman from Texas explained. Nothing new: The Dawn of the New Disciples has a history of being accused of being sexist and hateful towards women . Dangerous thinking: The religious group claims that sticking to gender stereotypes is the key to a healthy and happy household . Impressionable minds: This disturbing image was allegedly drawn by a child and shared on the group's Junior Disciples page, which was created for younger members of the sect . She continued: 'This is very demeaning to women and mothers. It also makes claims that any mother who chose a C-section committed a SIN and should have refused it even if it mean death for both the mother and child.' Dawn of the New Disciples currently runs numerous pro-life, pro-gun Twitter accounts and Facebook pages including The Dawn Guard Militia and Junior Disciples, a community for its younger members, which features\u00a0disturbing\u00a0religious\u00a0images allegedly created by children. One picture, which was posted in February, shows Jesus smiling while surrounded by guns. 'The Lord has given us many wonderful blessings in our life. None more precious than the God given right to bear arms. Every firearm is an extension of his hand. Every round like a heavenly embrace from Jesus himself, upon your adversary,' the group had captioned the controversial drawing. Violent thoughts: This childlike drawing shows Jesus smiling as he is surrounded by guns and a bloody knife . Loaded message: The picture was accompanied by this caption, which alleges that 'every firearm is an extension' of God's hand . Family affair: This photo of three young boys brandishing guns was shared on The Dawn Guard Militia page, which is also run by the religious community .",

The baby was in 'very critical condition' Friday, a day after the shooting, said Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Target: Police say a black car pulled alongside this silver Chevrolet Impala carrying Malaja and the driver and passenger opened fire, striking the 1-year-old in the head . On the road: The shooting took place at an intersection near an apartment complex in Kent, Washington . Robinson said the driver and passenger of the black car opened fire, then drove off, but police did not give details on the possible conflict between the people in both vehicles. The shooting took place at an intersection near the Lake Fenwick Estates apartment complex in Kent. Detectives in Kent initially suggested road rage as a motive, but Cmdr. Jarod Kasner told The Seattle Times Friday that police no longer think that's the case after further investigation. Police didn't provide further details on what they believe led to the shooting. Police said the shooting was preceded by some sort of an exchange between the occupants of the black sedan and the silver Chevy. Linda Johnston, who lives nearby, ran outside after she heard gunshots. 'I was sitting in my bedroom here and heard the shots. \"Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,\"' she told Seattle television station KOMO.

        "text": "A second spectacular blast from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile has covered nearby towns and villages in a thick layer of ash. The first eruption in over four decades\u00a0yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air, creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the\u00a0night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is one of the most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time yesterday. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Scroll down for video . Ghost town: Most people have abandoned the La Ensenada locality in Puerto Varas (pictured) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at Calbuco volcano . Scared: A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas (pictured) said she saw 'the column of smoke rising up' from the volcano when she looked out of her window' Aftermath: The two violent explosions shot billions of cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere, caking nearby localities like La Ensenada in mounds of abrasive soot . Colossal: Two massive explosions from Calbuco volcano in southern Chile have shot up to ten billion cubic metres of ash over six miles into the atmosphere (pictured) Dangerous: Many people in Puerto Varas (pictured) have become worried about the damage the ash will cause to their health . Stuck: As tractors try to clear the mounds of ash that have blocked the roads, one local said: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared... We have a layer of smoke above us' Contaminated: Ash from the second blast seriously impared the visibility of drivers fleeing the city of La Ensenada (pictured) near the volcano . Isolated: A masked and hooded woman stands alone among the ash falling in the San Marin de Los Andes area near Calbuco . Evacuation: Thousands have fled their homes after Calbuco erupted unexpectedly on Wednesday and was still pouring ash into the sky on Thursday . Explosion: A second eruption from the Calbuco volcano in Chile (pictured) has forced over 4,000 people to abandoned their homes and covered nearby communities in ash . Dramatic: 4,000 people were evacuated from cities around Calbuco following a second spectacular and frightening eruption today (pictured) Eruption: Residents of Puerto Montt had a clear view of the first terrifying explosion yesterday (pictured) which threw ash and smoke a staggering six miles into the air . Spectacle: The dense ash cloud from Calbuco today created an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night sky . Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt - 620 miles south of the capital Santiago. Even Professor David Pyle who has studied over a century of eruptions across Chile's 1000-mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one  among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the Pacific to Australia. He ranked this particular explosion 'a three or four' on the Volcanic Explosivity Index which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere. Professor Pyle told MailOnline: 'Based on a 15km-high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half, that\u2019s quite strong. This particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years. 'Sometimes it has lasted a day and other times it has bubbled on for a few weeks. The activity\u2019s died down for the moment but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.' Many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas admitted many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' 'People went into a state of panic' as the ash cloud spread, according to Miguel Diaz who lives in Puerto Montt 14 miles away. He added: 'I heard a loud noise as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.' Abandoned:\u00a0Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured since the first explosion yesterday . Volatile: Bachelet said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people . Covered: Resident of the Ensenada locality (pictured) near Calbuco struggled to clear the mountains of ash that had built up on their rooves . Locked out: Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano . Protection: Even residents in the Argentinian city of\u00a0San Carlos de Bariloche (pictured) donned gas masks to avoid the respiratory damage caused by the ash from Calbuco . Deadly: Smoke and lava spew from the Calbuco volcano, as seen from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas which is over 18 miles away . 'Even small amounts of ash can be really quite disruptive,' according to Professor Pyle who added: 'It affects power supplies and it can be disruptive to agriculture. You don\u2019t need particularly thick accumulations of ash to start to have physical consequences.' Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured and the only person who went missing since the first explosion was found on Thursday. She said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people. The director of a radio station in Puerto Montt described how hundreds of locals rushed to get gas following the eruption, forcing stations to ration their sales. And supermarkets closed their doors to avoid being looted. LATAM airlines has cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. A volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently in 2011, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Stiff winds blew the ash from that explosion over the border to Argentina where the thick, abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche. And by Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of the volcano. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business. 'We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,' said mayor Roberto Cacault. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert on Wednesday and set up an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the volcano. Ominous: The first eruption (pictured) sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away . Active: Calbuco (pictured yesterday) is one of Chile's three most dangerous volcanoes and part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country . Incredible: Smoke and lava shot out of Calbuco yesterday as people watched on from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas (pictured) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas (pictured) went about their business as Calbuco exploded, but local authorities setting up a 12.5-mile exclusion zone around it . Destructive: Volcanoes like Calbuco (pictured) occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust . Plume: While most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava, many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash (pictured) which is pushed through the earth's crust, covering the sky . Trevor Moffat who lives in Ensenada - some six miles from the volcano - said the eruption yesterday happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Danger: Residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time . Shocking: While the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon, the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in Argentina . Blanket: The last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake . Distant: A view of the ash cloud from the Nahuel Huapi lake, around 100 miles away from the volcano in neighbouring Argentina .",
        "generated": "The Calbuco volcano in southern Chile erupted twice in quick succession, causing a thick layer of ash to cover nearby towns and villages. The first eruption in over four decades yesterday sent up a huge plume of gas and ash, while the second eruption today forced over 4,000 people to flee their homes. The ash from both eruptions seriously impaired the visibility of drivers and caused concern among residents about the harmful effects on their health. The volcano is one of the most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes and has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years.

The 2013 US Open champion ended the day on seven under, sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader Jordan Spieth. But it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening-day 67. Rose bogeyed three of the first four holes, finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots. And that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue. He revealed: \u2018I was feeling really uncomfortable with my game, so I drew a line on my scorecard at that point, like you draw a line in the sand. Justin Rose battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at Augusta . Rose tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third, seven shots behind runaway leader Jordan Spieth . Rose flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the Englishman . \u2018I told myself to move on and take one shot at a time. I made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me, and after that I played with the same rhythm as the first day.\u2019 The dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes, putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times. And 34-year-old Rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend. He said: \u2018I\u2019m starting seven back and Jordan has played beautifully so far, but we all know a lot can happen. There\u2019s magic out there on this course and it\u2019s up to me to make something special happen.\u2019 Maybe Ian Poulter could borrow Rose\u2019s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn\u2019t get going. He was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament. He said on Twitter: \u2018Really disappointed.

Three weeks after an Italian court overturned her conviction for the 2007 murder of British student, Meredith Kercher, Preston told RadarOnline that Knox is living out a bittersweet victory. 'She went to Italy as a normal 20-year-old, West Coast girl, a soccer player, rock climber, very na\u00efve,' says Preston about Knox's ill-fated adventure to Perugia. 'So many terrible things happened to her in Italy, so many lies were said, and the online savagery directed at her, I've never seen anything like it.' So affected has Knox been by her struggle to be exonerated by the Italian courts, that Preston hinted to RadarOnline that she is suffering PTSD and seeking professional help. 'Anyone who has been through what she's been through is going to have issues. It's like a soldier come back from Iraq, having children shot in front of him, you've been through a horrific experience. If it doesn't affect you physically, it affects you emotionally,' he says to Radar. Family struggle: Amanda Knox stands on the front porch with her fianc\u00e9, her mother Edda Mellas and stepfather, Chris Mellas. According to her biographer, Knox and her family have spent millions fighting her conviction . On top of her fight to be declared innocent, Preston claims that Knox has been ravaged financially by legal fees. This despite receiving a reported $4 million advance for her 2013 book, Waiting To Be Heard. 'The ordeal has been hugely emotional, but the financial impact has been catastrophic,' says Preston. 'Amanda received a $4 million advance for her book, that money has all gone, immediately out of the door to pay legal fees and there is nothing left,' Preston explains. 'She really wants to establish that she's innocent in Italy, they've paid a lot of fees to Italian lawyers.' Knox, 27, fought the Italian legal system for eight years, spent four years in prison and went through three appeals until she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in late March for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Shared experience: This split picture shows Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, arriving with penitentiary police to a court hearing in Perugia September 26, 2008 . Beginning of her nightmare: Amanda Knox leaves with penitentiary police after a court hearing in Perugia in September 2008 after she and her ex-boyfriend were arrested for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Kercher was discovered in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Kercher in November 2007. The British student had been stabbed four times and her throat slit in what the Italian courts claimed was a sex-game gone wrong. Knox and Sollecito was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 26 years behind bars, but were acquitted in 2011. Knox immediutely returned to the United States protesting her innocence, but in January 2014, the Italian courts overturned that acquittal and reinstated the guilty verdict. However, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court and their conviction was overturned. Tears: Amanda Knox breaks down after hearing she had been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in October, 2011 . Return home: Amanda Knox pauses emotionally while speaking during a news conference at Sea-Tac International Airport, Washington after landing there on a flight from Italy, October 4, 2011 after her acquittal . On the announcement of her innocence, Knox appeared on her Seattle doorstep to make a statement. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas, sister, Deanna Knox, and fianc\u00e9, Colin Sutherland, the 27-year-old broke down in tears as she told the press: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' Amanda Knox could now receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. It is thought that Knox will return to Italy, despite having vowed never to, and will write about the country's legal and judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Both Knox (above) and Sollecito could now seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito\u2019s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' She added that she was 'full of joy' following Italy's highest court's decision to overturn her murder conviction, saying: 'I'm incredibly grateful for what has happened. For the justice I have received, for the support I have had from everyone, from my family and my friends to strangers.' Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who has said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement, saying she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.'",

Rihanna Cooper, 21, from Hull, hit the headlines when, at 16, she became the youngest person in Britain to be accepted for gender reassignment. But part way through her treatment, the stress of her transition from male to female became too much and she  called a halt to it. Scroll down for video . Transgender woman Rihanna Cooper, 21, is paying for her gender reassignment herself . Now, having realised she can't go on as a man again and having to  pay for her treatment privately, Rihanna is working as an escort to fund her dreams. She said: 'Working as an escort can be dangerous and frightening. It's exhausting sometimes too. 'But it's the only way I have of earning enough money to become a woman.' Her initial treatment, and her subsequent decision to abandon the reassignment programme, sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed to swap sexes in the first place. But Rihanna insists that her decision was the right one - and blames NHS psychiatrists and doctors for clouding her focus. Rihanna was born Bradley Cooper in January 1994, and grew up with her mum, Elaine, 46, and three sisters, Claire, now 29, Katy, 26, and Sophie, 23. Born Bradley Cooper, Rihanna realised she was born in the wrong body and at 16 was accepted for treatment . Rihanna says: 'From an early age, I wanted to play with my sisters' Barbie dolls. My mum bought me Action men but I wasn't interested. 'I used to love watching her put make-up on. I was always stealing her lipstick. 'At school, my friends were all girls and I loved playing netball. 'I knew I had been born in the wrong body and I wanted so desperately to be a girl. 'I was an angry kid, because I was so confused, and though I was never bullied, I got into trouble, and I ended up expelled from school.' At 15, she announced that she wanted to become a girl. She says: 'It was hardly a shock. My family had always known. My mum and sisters were very supportive.' At 16, Rihanna was referred for specialist psychiatric assessments and she began dressing and living as a girl, painting her nails and growing her hair. However Rihanna, pictured centre with her mother and sister, said she actually wanted to be a boy part way through her NHS treatment - sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed . But Rihanna blames NHS medics for clouding her focus - and says she does want to be a woman . Her story hit the press as she became Britain's youngest sex-swap patient. But she rebelled against the treatment programme. She says: 'I hated the psychiatric treatment. I felt as though I was being made to justify why I wanted to be a girl, like they wanted to catch me out almost. 'I knew I was a girl inside, and to me, it was that simple.' At 17, she began a course of hormone injections but stopped the treatment after two suicide attempts. She says: 'The whole thing just got on top of me. I was sick of travelling to my appointments where I felt everyone was trying to catch me out and trip me up. 'I felt so alone, so isolated. I just wanted to be happy. My treatment caused a lot of stress in my family and I just wanted everything to go back to how it was.' Her full transgender op, scheduled for January 2013, was called off and she returned to living as a young man - but says she soon realised she could not live a lie. She is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately, using her work as an escort to fund her surgery. She is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately, using her work as an escort to fund her surgery . Rihanna hasn't asked the NHS to fund this reassignment, and doubts they would, because she pulled out last time. She also feels the psychiatric assessments were too invasive and the NHS programme was too invasive, so she wants to fund it herself. First on her list is a \u00a34,500 breast enlargement, followed by surgery to remove her male genitalia. Rihanna says: 'I've always wanted to be a girl and that has never changed. I was born in the wrong body. 'My work as an escort is not ideal, but it is virtually impossible for me to get any kind of work, because of the stigma which surrounds transgender people. I see this as my only chance to fulfil my dreams.' The following is part on an NHS guide . If your child is under 18 and thought to have gender dysphoria, they will usually be referred to a specialist child and adolescent Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). Currently, the only specialist clinic for young people with gender identity issues is run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London, although they occasionally provide satellite clinics in other parts of the country. Staff at these clinics can carry out a detailed assessment of your child, to help them determine what support they need. SOURCE .",

        "text": "It is not the first advertising billboard in which a company has used the image of a svelte, bikini-clad model to sell its wares and it probably won\u2019t be the last. But something about this poster for Protein World diet supplements has struck a collective raw nerve. The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign \u2014 including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat. Scroll down for video . Protein World's billboard campaign advertising diet supplements features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?' Campaigners launched a scathing attack on the protein supplement company after the advert \u2014 which features a toned model posing with the slogan \u2018Are you beach body ready?\u2019 \u2014 began appearing on the London Underground three weeks ago. The \u2018body shaming\u2019 campaign has seen many of its posters defaced with feminist slogans, more than 50,000 people sign a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest. But yesterday the company\u2019s marketing boss claimed the firm is \u2018just trying to make the nation healthier\u2019. Richard Staveley, Protein World\u2019s head of global marketing, added: \u2018It\u2019s been a brilliant campaign for us and I don\u2019t see us changing anything dramatically any time soon.\u2019 Richard Staveley, Protein World\u2019s head of global marketing revealed that the company has received bomb threats in the wake of the campaign but said it had been 'brilliant' and that he didn't see the company changing . On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert \u2018a little bit anxiety-inducing' On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert \u2018a little bit anxiety-inducing\u2019. And the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed it had received 277 complaints, with many commenting that \u2018the advert is offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image\u2019. Posters have been vandalised with feminist messages such as \u2018Your body is not a commodity\u2019. Photographs of the amended signs have gone viral online. Despite the controversy, earlier in the week the company announced on Twitter it had made sales of \u00a31 million and attracted 20,000 new customers in just four days following the advert\u2019s release. Protein World has taken a strong stance on social media during the furore and has posted blunt replies to complaints on Twitter, including \u2018why make your insecurities our problem\u2019 and \u2018grow up\u2019. The company\u2019s CEO and founder, Arjun Seth, has even branded the people defacing his adverts \u2018terrorists\u2019, \u2018irrational and extremist\u2019. But the poster has struck a collective raw nerve with many of the billboards being vandalised with people writing messages reinforcing that every 'body' of any shape, size and age is ready for the beach - \u00a0such as #eachbodysready . Pictured of the defaced posters have appeared on Facebook, such as this which someone had covered with a note which reads: '1 You're body is fine just as it is. 2 Whatever it looks like your body is not a commodity #Everybody's ready #Everyday sexism' Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Mr Staveley said his company had received a series of threats, including one to bomb its head office. He said: \u2018First, we\u2019ve been inundated, as you\u2019ve probably seen from our Twitter feed and Facebook, of people defacing adverts, ripping them down and climbing over rail tracks to graffiti them. \u2018That\u2019s criminal behaviour. I think that\u2019s quite extreme behaviour. \u2018We\u2019ve actually had threats on our head office, physical, violent threats. We had a bomb threat.\u2019 More than 52,300 people have signed a petition demanding the adverts are removed. Demonstrators plan to congregate at London\u2019s Hyde Park on Saturday for a protest dubbed \u2018Taking back the beach\u2019. On a Facebook page calling on people to attend the demonstration, a post reads: \u2018The idea that your body should be hidden away if it doesn\u2019t meet these bizarrely specific requirements . . . I\u2019m over it.\u2019 The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign \u2014 including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat . More than 50,000 people have already signed a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest . When Miss Reid asked Mr Staveley about claims the posters make women feel anxious, he replied: \u2018We\u2019re advertising our weight-loss collection. That\u2019s what millions of people are aspiring to do in time for their summer holiday \u2014 to lose a bit of weight, feel a bit healthier and get fitter. It\u2019s not a new concept.\u2019 He confirmed the model in the picture, Australian Renee Somerfield, 23, had achieved her enviable physique using Protein World products, and denied the image had been retouched or altered. A spokesman for Transport for London said the adverts will be taken down from today \u2014 not because of the controversy, but because they have \u2018come to the end of their natural three-week advertising lifespan\u2019. Sioned Quirke, a specialist dietitian based in South Wales, said: \u2018Some people do find that increasing their protein intake can aid weight loss. \u2018But generally, taking a supplement or diet pill will not do all the work for you. \u2018Also, these kinds of products are not regulated or monitored, so you can never be 100 per cent sure what is actually in them.\u2019 Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters .",

After stopping on track in each of the practice sessions on Friday due to technical issues, Button made it a hat-trick in qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix. After just three corners of the Bahrain International Circuit, the 35-year-old ground to a halt with what the team believe to be another electrical issue. Jenson Button was given a lift back to the pits on a motorcycle by a marshal after his engine failure . In first practice on Friday, the engine in Button's car cut out at the first corner of his opening quick lap due to an electrical failure, and then come FP2 a sensor issue forced him to pull over. Racing director Eric Boullier insists the problems are 'unrelated', and 'just glitches stopping the car'. The latest glitch, however, means Button will start the race 20th and last - his lowest grid slot since the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, when he was driving for current power-unit suppliers Honda. In contrast, and on the upside, team-mate Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season and will start 14th. Describing his emotions, Button said: 'We're racing drivers and you want to drive your racing car as fast as you can. 'Obviously when you are limited to running in P1 and P2, with two stops on the circuit, it's tough. 'But given how things felt this weekend, in terms of driving the car this morning, it felt pretty good. Button jumps out of his McLaren\u00a0after failing to complete the qualifying session in Bahrain . 'I was quite happy with it. I ended up 11th. It's still only P3, but it was a good feeling. 'With Fernando in qualifying, our best qualifying getting into Q2, you have to look at the positives. 'You would say we're definitely making progress - we're improving every race we go to - but just a tough weekend on my side of the garage.' Alonso finished just four tenths of a second off reaching the top-10 shoot-out, but concedes he needs a helping hand if he is to finish in the points. The double world champion said: 'We're a little closer than any other race this year, but we have to keep our feet on the ground. Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season . '(On Saturday) we were 14th fastest, so (on Sunday) if nothing happens we will be 14th fastest in the race probably. 'This is not enough to be in the points. We know our limitations are still there, so we will try to do our best. 'Races can change quickly. Some things can happen at the start, with pit stops, so we will take any opportunity we have. 'The main priority is to finish the race, hopefully with both cars, to learn as much as we can with this car. 'The position at the end will depend on many factors, and probably a little bit it depends on the others as well. 'If we want some points probably we need some help.'",

        "text": "Nairobi, Kenya  (CNN)Kenya froze dozens of accounts linked to suspected terror supporters after militants massacred 147 people last week at a university in Garissa. The government is tracking the finances of people suspected of ties to Al-Shabaab, the militant group that claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack. So far, the government has frozen 86 accounts, but that number could go up, said Mwenda Njoka, a spokesman for the  Interior Ministry. The government has tracked supporters of the terror group since 2011, and efforts to freeze their assets have gone on since then. It has a list of suspects from various parts of the country, but mostly in Nairobi and Mombasa, he said. Kenyans mourned the victims of the attack Tuesday night at Nairobi's Uhuru Park, where hundreds gathered. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses, some draped with the nation's flag, as candles flickered in the dark. Of the fatalities, 142 were students at the university, and the rest were security forces and campus security. \"I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying,\" said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. \"They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education.\" Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released the names of the victims. Kenyan authorities had prior intelligence that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. The frozen accounts is the latest in a series of actions as the government faced heavy criticism for the siege, which lasted hours. A spokesman for President Uhuru Kenyatta said authorities \"got the job done\" and saved lives. The university had about 800 students. \"With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,\"  Manoah Esipisu said. Kenya also launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, who said they were not retaliation for last week's massacre. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011,\"  the source said Monday. Kenya has also offered 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on the whereabouts of Mohamed Mohamud, who allegedly organized the attack. Mohamud is a senior Al-Shabaab leader known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, authorities said. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before.  In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. CNN's Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.",

The unidentified child caused the presidential residence to be closed off for a few moments on Sunday afternoon. 'Child was fine and was safely reunited with parents' following the incident, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN. A four-year-old child climbed under a temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue triggering Secret Service to put the president residence under lock down for a few moments . The incident is the second lockdown in Washington only a day after a man shot and killed himself on Saturday. The man died after shooting himself on the west front of the Capitol building just after 1 p.m., Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said. No one else was hurt. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said the man had a backpack and a rolling suitcase, triggering an hours-long lockdown, and a sign that said something about 'social justice.' Witness Robert Bishop told CNN it said something about taxing the '1%.' Bomb squad members respond to reports of a suspicious package on the West Front of the US Capitol,  on Capitol Hill on Saturday. A man carrying a backpack and rolling suitcase shot himself while carrying a sign about taxation. Authorities do not believe there is a terrorism connection . Robert Bishop of Annapolis, Maryland said he was biking near the steps of the Capitol when the suicide happened. Bishop didn't witness the suicide but said there were about 60 people in the area, and that some of them did, including a girl and her mother who immediately began crying afterward. Bishop said another witness told him and a police officer that the man who killed himself held up a protest sign about taxation just before pulling the trigger. The lockdown came during Washington's annual Cherry Blossom Festival, which attracts thousands of tourists during Washington's busy season. Congress has been on spring recess for two weeks and lawmakers are set to return to work Monday. Busy day: The suicide came on one of the busiest days for tourist in the U.S. Capitol as travelers from the world over flock to the yearly cherry blossom festival . January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the drone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.",

A video from the office features characters in 'safety suits' including Bubbleman, a 'Fashionista' wrapped in the poppable material and a young man in flashing lights. The campaigners are seen talking to residents about the dangers of not looking up from one's phone, including the fact that 37 people died from being hit by cars last year. While other safety programs are directed at keeping motorists from hitting and killing pedestrians, the City of Brotherly Love's is focused on those walking around the city. Scroll down for video . A video from the Philadelphia Office of Transportation shows characters such as Bubbleman talking to residents about the dangers of phone usage while walking around the city . A character called the Fashionista (center, in bubble wrap) said 'jaywalking is the new catwalking' as part of a snarky reminder to pedestrians to be aware of their surroundings . It is aimed at 18 to 25-year-olds who the campaign says are most likely to be hit by cars while on their phones. More than 40 per cent of drivers who hit pedestrians and 30 per cent of the 1,800 pedestrians that are hit are 18 to 34, Mayor's office planner Ema Yamamoto said, according to Plan Philly. The snarky video's Safety Suiter characters say they 'can't think of any other way to not get hit by a car' besides wearing their ridiculous costumes. Another character, the Fashionista, says that 'jaywalking is the new catwalking'. A 'Tech guy' in a helmet with flashing lights on his body also gave information to residents, including that 37 pedestrians died last year . The SafetySuiters (played by different actors) are part of a campaign to drive down pedestrian deaths among young people, based around a series of slogans including 'It's road safety, not rocket science' Large signs in Philadelphia that say 'Pick Your Head Up'  are also part of the bid to end phone use, which is thought to contribute to five people being hit per day. The campaign, which has more slogans such as \u00a0'It's road safety, not rocket science' and 'jaywalking can lead to not walking', also includes signs meant for drivers on its website. One says 'Cars have bumpers, people don't'. Some have criticized the Philadelphia campaign for focuses too much on pedestrians and blaming them for getting hit by cars. Twitter user JonasMcivitas called the ads 'tone deaf'. 'Certainly everybody is responsible for paying attention to their surroundings. But a car can kill people. Drivers should be a million times more the focus of this campaign because a driver bears the responsibility for not killing people,' local planner Victoria Harris said. Some have found Philadelphia's safety slogans such as 'jaywalking can lead to notwalking' to be 'tone deaf' Some pedestrian advocates and urban planners have criticized certain safety education efforts for placing blame on those who are hit by cars. Above, a campaign in Montgomery County, Maryland . The pedestrian safety coordinator for Montgomery County said that the graphic campaign was to help humanize pedestrian victims of accidents . Yamamoto said that the new campaign was simply explaining good behavior for smartphone users, who 'need to be aware of their surroundings'. Backlash against the campaign follows a similarly controversial public education effort in Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of Washington DC. Posters with tire marks over young people's faces were seen as blaming them for their own deaths, though the pedestrian safety coordinator told WTOP\u00a0that the Street Smart campaign was an attempt to humanize victims.

Teenager Li Hao-tong looked to have done enough to secure a hugely popular victory on home soil, the 19-year-old emerging from a crowded leaderboard to card a closing 67 to finish 12 under par. That left overnight leader Aphibarnrat two shots behind with two holes to play, only for the 25-year-old to hole from 18 feet for an eagle on the 17th and then miss from 12 feet for what would have been a winning birdie on the last. Kiradech Aphibarnrat poses with the trophy having won his second European Tour title in\u00a0Shenzhen . The players returned to the 18th for the play-off and Aphibarnrat completed victory in style, hitting his approach to virtually the same place as he had in regulation and this time holing the birdie putt after Li had missed from long range. 'I have been struggling for a year,' said Aphibarnrat, whose previous win came in the Malaysian Open in 2013. 'I lost my coach (Natpasit Chokthanasart, who died in December 2013), I changed my equipment and haven't been on the top of the leaderboard for a while but finally I can do it and it was great. 'I had a chance to win in 72 holes but the putt in the play-off is the best putt I have ever made in my life.' Aphibarnrat can't hold back his emotions, celebrating on the 18th green with his Mother . Aphibarnrat had been six shots clear of the field after 16 holes of the third round, but finished double-bogey, bogey to take a two-shot advantage into the final day. That was wiped out by a fast start from Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who carded four birdies and one bogey in his first six holes, with Aphibarnrat also dropping shots on the fifth and seventh. Birdies on the ninth and 10th took Aphibarnrat back into the lead as Larrazabal fell away, but bogeys on the 12th and 15th opened the door for Li to take over at the top thanks to birdies on the 11th, 13th and 14th. The 25-year-old was evidently emotional (left), and congratulated by Chinese teenager Li Hao-tong (right) Another birdie on the 17th made Li odds-on favourite to become the first Chinese winner of a European Tour event on home soil, but the 19-year-old could only watch on television as Aphibarnrat conjured up a brilliant finish. 'It's been such a tough day today,' Aphibarnrat added. 'I didn't start well like the other days with three or four birdies, I was one over on the front nine and Pablo was playing great to start. He put a lot of pressure on me. 'I tried to play more safe than the first three rounds because the wind was picking up and it was not easy to make birdies. I just tried to hit it on the greens but I was struggling with my putting, everything was too tight and I felt nervous on the front nine. 'Special thanks to my caddie, he was always pushing me. When we were two behind on the last two holes he said you have not lost, we have not signed the scorecard yet and he was completely right and I just got the job done.' England's Tommy Fleetwood finished a shot outside the play-off after missing from long range for birdie on the 18th in a third consecutive 69, with seven players tied for fourth on 10 under.

        "text": "Harry Kane hailed an unforgettable week after taking his England bow and becoming the youngest captain in the Premier League this season - but he will want to erase the memory of Tottenham's goalless draw at Burnley. Kane, 21, was chosen as Spurs captain after a week which has also seen him score on his England debut and make his first start for the national team. It was a frustrating end to the week for Kane however as Spurs struggled to make an impact against a hard-working Burnley side who earned a precious point in their battle to avoid relegation. Harry Kane has hailed his trailblazing few days as the \u2018best week of my life\u2019 after captaining Tottenham . That came after he scored within seconds of his England debut against Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley . Kane said: 'You could say it has been the best week of my life - to score, to make my first start and score for England, and to be captain today. It has been an unbelievable couple of weeks and one I won't forget for the rest of my career.' Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admitted a top-four place may be beyond his side as they are seven points off fourth-placed Manchester City - who play Crystal Palace on Monday night - with a vastly inferior goal difference. Pochettino said: 'It is difficult but we have seven games, we will try. It is true that it is not easy. This game was a very tough game and we need to try to win the most points possible in the next seven games. 'The way Burnley play it is difficult, because always there is long balls into the box. They are a very aggressive team and run a lot. It is difficult to find space to play. 'We played better in the second half and we made some chances but it was not enough to score. Three weeks ago Manchester City lost here. It is not an excuse but it is a very, very difficult team.' Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino still believes they can catch Manchester City and finish fourth . The goalless draw at Burnley left Tottenham down in sixth, some seven points adrift of Man City . At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley . Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in their 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Sunday . Pochettino confirmed Kyle Walker, who limped off, has a sprain but said it was 'not a big issue'. Burnley manager Sean Dyche claimed the Clarets had the better of the match and rued a gilt-edged chance missed by Danny Ings, who shot straight at Michel Vorm when it seemed easier to score. He said: 'I think we edged the game, but there was not a lot in it. 'We kept the tempo high and kept pressing high. Danny has had a great chance and it was unlike him not to put it away, he almost hit it too cleanly. 'Having said that we are pleased to get another clean sheet against a top side.' Dyche picked out Ashley Barnes for special praise but said the whole of his team had performed well against a Spurs side boasting four England players. The Burnley boss also said he was not too concerned by their struggles to find the net - they have only scored once in five games. He added: 'I prefer to look at it as two clean sheets in the last three games against some fantastic sides.' Kane (left) watches his header find the net against Lithuania and it earned him a start against Italy . Sean Dyche believed Burnley might have taken all three points from the match .

        "text": "A leading hospital has slashed cases of a deadly infection that can kill newborn babies \u2013 by defying national guidelines to offer all pregnant women a simple screening test. Government officials have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence to support universal screening for Group B Strep, known as GBS. This is despite the fact it is carried by one in four women and infects as many as 400 newborns in the UK every year. One in ten will die. Current guidelines only recommend testing women deemed to be 'at risk'. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bowman, 37, lost her daughter Lily after she contracted GBS during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia. She was just three days old . But a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at Northwick Park NHS hospital in North-West London resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested and subsequently treated with antibiotics. The only recorded cases during the 12-month programme affected babies of women who had not agreed to be tested. Crucially, clinicians noted that half of the women who tested positive for GBS would not have been classified as 'at risk' under the current guidelines \u2013 so their babies would not have been protected. The UK National Screening Committee carried out a review in 2012 in collaboration with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives and NHS England. It concluded that not all women who test positive for GBS will go on to develop the infection or pass it on to their babies, so blanket screening would mean pregnant women would be unnecessarily given antibiotics, which carry their own risks to the foetus. Some studies link antibiotics used in pregnancy and labour to obesity and asthma. In premature babies an increased risk of cerebral palsy has been associated with use of some antibiotics in labour. Yet these results confound the decision, prompting calls for the Government to introduce universal testing for pregnant women during standard ante-natal appointments, as is the case in Germany, France and the US. A programme which offered screening to all expectant women at Northwick Park NHS hospital in North-West London resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested . Jane Plumb, chief executive of the charity Group B Strep Support, said: 'The risk-based strategy has failed to reduce the rate of GBS infection, and these findings contradict the party line that the risks of screening every woman would outweigh the benefits.' The consultant microbiologist who introduced the screening programme at Northwick Park, Dr Guduru Gopal Rao, said: 'There was a substantial burden of infection in our local community which was not being prevented by the national guidelines. 'Our work shows that GBS screening of all expectant mothers can work and is likely to be more effective than the current risk based approach.' Dr Richard Nicholl, consultant neonatal paediatrician at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, said he had seen more than 100 babies with GBS in 20 years. He said: 'It can lead to serious illness and high mortality rates so it is much better to prevent the infection, rather than attempt to treat it. 'Since we began our comprehensive screening programme, I have not seen a new case in the babies of the mothers we have screened.' The makers of a new style of leggings claim they will reduce the appearance of cellulite in just 30 days, thanks to the garment's 'dimple-destroying' crystal technology. The Crystal Smooth Anti-Cellulite leggings are made from a fibre woven with bio-active crystals, which absorb body heat to stimulate blood flow and lymphatic drainage. GBS is the most common cause of infection in newborn babies in the UK. Harmless when carried by women, it can prove fatal to babies who contract it when passing through the birth canal. Many develop meningitis and septicaemia and, if they survive, can be left with life-altering disabilities. Known as the enhanced culture method, the test simply involves taking a swab from the woman. It would cost the NHS approximately \u00a311 per patient. Belinda Bowman, 37, lost her daughter Lily after she contracted GBS during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia. She was just three days old. Belinda, who has three older children, had asked a midwife for a GBS test when she went to be induced at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, in May 2013 after noticing some unusual discharge. But she was told it was 'not standard practice' and there was 'no reason' to give her test. Mrs Bowman said: 'What hurts most is that Lily's death was entirely preventable.' Mrs Bowman is now involved in a legal battle with the hospital over claims that staff repeatedly failed to spot how seriously ill Lily was after her birth. She is being represented by law firm Leigh Day. Bond girl Naomie's on a fitness mission . She's the British Bond girl with a body to die for.

        "text": "We're suckers for athletes who play with a lot of heart. In Erik Compton's case, make that plural: hearts. He'll tee off this week at the Masters on his third. The 35-year-old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he's had to overcome to earn a spot in the field. But Compton isn't shy about sharing his story, either. Erik Compton shares a joke with Jim Furyk during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters . A first heart transplant at 12, then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack - what doctors call a 'widow-maker' - while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal Charlie DeLucca. He's been trying make up for lost time ever since. 'It's hard, but it's also a great thing,' Compton said on Monday after a practice round at Augusta National. 'There's two sides to me. I'm a competitor and a sports person, and I'm also the recipient of two transplants, and I know what that involves. So when you put them together, it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know.' 'I'll take it,' he added a moment later. It's not like Compton had a choice. He recovered from his childhood setback to become the No 1-ranked junior in the United States at 18, then a two-time All-American at Georgia. Compton, 35, is set to make his first appearance at the famous tournament this week . But he's spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits, then becoming an advocate and spokesman for Donate Life, an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation. In a nice bit of serendipity, his first appearance in the Masters coincides with Donate Life Month. But it's already a full-time campaign for Compton - he's been displaying the organization's logo on his shirt sleeve for a while. All of those efforts paid big dividends last year, when he carved out a spot on the PGA Tour and nearly stole the show at the US Open. His runner-up finish at Pinehurst nudged Compton and his story into the spotlight - and earned him an invitation to Augusta. It was something he'd longed to do since watching the tournament on TV as a kid. 'For me, it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think, I'm never going to play in the Masters, just because of other issues that I've had. But yet, I just love to watch the Masters. So it's going to be weird,' he said to laughter, 'not watching the Masters this year.' Compton's wife, Barbara, and parents Peter and Eli won't be tuning in this year, either, making the drive up from Florida to watch Erik play in person. It's a well-deserved reward to be sure, since all of them had a hand in the push-pull climb toward the top of the golf hill. The veteran has had two heart transplants, but wants to focus on the week ahead, rather than his journey . After walking most his son's practice round, Peter Compton recalled how motivated Erik was, no matter how tough things seemed. Six months after Hurricane Andrew hit the Miami area in 1992, forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near Doral, he took his son to play a few holes. 'We were in a cart and back then, he liked driving more than playing,' Peter recalled. 'But every time we'd leave the tee, he'd drive to his ball, and he was already hitting it 225 (yards) or so. So finally, about the third time it happened, I had to remind him, \"Hey, stop here. Let me play MY tee shots!\" 'He started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was,' Peter said. 'But it wasn't long after that Erik started winning those tournaments. ... He could have sat back, said he'd been dealt a bad hand and did nothing. So I think that's what we're most proud of - he refused to give up.' Compton chats with his caddie as he walks the famous course ahead of his first ever round at the Masters . Compton tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations. After a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour, his breakthrough performance at Pinehurst - only the second major he qualified to play. But Compton struggled this year, opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th. He then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments. At the moment, most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play . 'I'm here in the press room at the Masters, and that's a great thing,' he said. 'But I don't look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... I look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that's happened to me in the past. Golf's been very therapeutic for me over the years. 'As I'm sitting here today,' Compton concluded, 'I view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the Masters.'",

        "text": "Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson has revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by\u00a0People\u00a0magazine on Tuesday. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double\u00a0mastectomy . 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by\u00a0Glenne Headly. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.",

        "text": "Famous Italian designers like Fendi, Gucci and Prada may be toted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Kate Moss and Katy Perry, but few are probably aware of the history behind the brands they wear. A new book has now archived the changing face of Italian fashion, from the post-war years to the 21st century. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day, captures the evolution of Mediterranean style through 300 iconic dresses and archived images. Model Joan Olsen (left) shows off bold linear prints in an outfit by haute couture designer/artist Livio de Simone in 1954. Co-author Enrico says that Italian glamour is not 'sophisticated or artificial' The book was compiled by Enrico Quinto and Paolo Tinarelli - the two men who  were the first to introduce the concept of vintage style in Italy . The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers. A woman wears a structural suit by Fernandi, at a time when Italian fashion was beginning to break away from Parisian style . In the mid-fifties, Emilio Frederico Schuberth created an outfit which had a removable over-skirt so that the wearer could opt for a straight or flared silhouette . Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period.

Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer - her designs were on several occasions interpreted by Christian Dior . In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. Germana Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer, and her designs were, on several occasions, interpreted by Frenchman Christian Dior. The book also examines how trends developed over the years and iconic celebrity moments that would cement a designer's fame. One in particular came in 1956, when Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival. Schuberth became known as the 'tailor to the stars', and also catered for the likes of Rita Hayworth and Brigitte Bardot. His students included Valentino Garavani - who continues to be an Italian powerhouse today.

This dress by Emilio Schuberth cemented his position as 'tailor to the stars' Late sixties and early seventies creations from Fendi, including the bag with the signature interlocking Fs (right) Examples of humble beginnings are especially surprisingly when looking at labels such as Fendi - who originally came into existence as a leather and fur shop in Rome. From the mid-Sixties, Karl Lagerfeld was involved in the design of Fendi's logo with the interlocking F letters. Several designers in the book, such as Federico Forquet, are no longer operational, but were important in influencing and shaping the overall movement and progression of Italian fashion. The book also highlights how certain Italian designers, such as Roberto Carpucci, were propelled to fame when clothes were featured in advertorials - eventually appearing in publications such as Vogue. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . Renowned Italian designer, Roberto Carpucci's structural designs featured in Vogue Italia in 1982 . A defining moment for Italian fashion was circa 1994; Elizabeth Hurley stepped out in a Versace safety pin gown that was to become one of the most iconic dresses of all time. From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an accessible beauty - simple and natural.' Elizabeth Hurley in 1994 (left), pictured with then-beau, Hugh Grant (right) wearing the Versace dress that would go down in fashion history . Liz Hurley's dress (pictured) was a creation from Gianni Versace's spring/summer 1994 collection . In fact, Italian style has made a huge contribution to the fashion industry today, with Milan Fashion Week still a crucial part of the circuit, and with young models such as Kendall Jenner flocking to Milan every year. Popular culture figures such as Rihanna, are also active lovers of the Italian style. Rihanna recently customised a Fendi Baguette bag for a charity auction, along with Sarah Jessica Parker.

Successful models such as Kendall Jenner (pictured) flock to Milan Fashion Week every season to walk in shows such as Dolce & Gabbana (left - Autumn/Winter 2015, right - Spring/Summer 2015). Italian style is very much still crucial to the fashion landscape . In terms of the state of Italian glamour now, Enrico argues that it is a changing landscape, but something that maintains its simplicity. 'Italy has become more global and the melting pot of different nationalities has automatically brought new influences into Italy's lifestyle. 'I believe that  the essence of Italian glamour is based on a certain 'minimalism'. Clothing still has to be practical and adapted to an understated lifestyle. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day (Skira Editore) is out on 30 March 2015.",

The SNP leader has said she is prepared to work with Labour to put Mr Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron's Conservatives win more seats. Ms Sturgeon was today swamped with requests for selfies in the wake of her triumph in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon today warned Ed Miliband that time is running out on her offer to help lock the Tories out of power . The SNP is projected to win more than 40 seats in Scotland at the election, potentially leaving them holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories both fall short. Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power. She has suggested a full-blown coalition, with SNP ministers in the Cabinet, is unlikely to be the outcome. But her MPs could vote to prop up a Labour minority administration, raising the prospect of a Scottish-backed government over-ruling the views of a majority in England. Labour leader Ed Miliband is forecast to lose dozens of seats to the SNP after a sharp drop in support in Scotland . However, today Ms Sturgeon made clear he patience is wearing thin, and called on Mr Miliband to respond to her offer. She claimed that every day that passes risks fuelling the impression that Mr Miliband would rather see the Conservatives return to government than work with the SNP. Addressing supporters in Livingston, Ms Sturgeon insisted the SNP is not seeking any UK ministerial posts. But said she will fight for as much power for Scotland as she can get. Her predecessor as First Minister Alex Salmond\u00a0 has already vowed to hold a Labour minority government to ransom to secure a \u00a3180billion debt-fuelled spending spree in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Even if the Tories are the largest party, I have said we will vote to stop the Tory government getting off the ground,' she said. 'I have asked Ed Miliband to confirm that Labour will do likewise. Thus far, Labour hasn't given that commitment. 'I hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the suspicion that Labour would rather see the Tories get back into power than work with the SNP. 'If that is the case, then people in Scotland, I don't think, will ever forgive the Labour Party.' She added: 'I have said a formal coalition with Labour is unlikely. 'The SNP is not going to Westminster to seek ministerial posts, we're going to Westminster to make Scotland's voice heard and to win more progressive policies for Scotland. 'Now, I've ruled out any kind of arrangement with the Tories, but I have also said to Labour, very directly, if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons, then even if the Tories are the biggest party, if Labour and the SNP work together we can stop a Tory government getting off the ground. 'I repeat that call to Ed Miliband today, and maybe today unlike the previous few days he will answer that. 'If we have an anti-Tory majority, will he work with the SNP rather than allow David Cameron back into Downing Street?' The Scottish First Minister was swamped with requests for selfies as she met residents of Livingston, west Lothian this morning . Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power .

Ms Sturgeon was said to have triumped in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7 . She also outlined changes she said would support childcare and getting parents back to work, including uprating child tax credits and child benefit and a rise in the minimum wage to \u00a38.70. Ms Sturgeon said she still wants Scotland to be independent, but in the meantime 'will push for the maximum devolution to Scotland'. 'If Scotland is to become independent, that will only happen with a vote in a referendum,' she said. 'But poll after poll shows that people in Scotland want significantly more powers in the Scottish Parliament. 'Now, I will not stop campaigning for and wanting Scotland to become independent, but that will only happen in a referendum.' Scottish Liberal Democrat president Sir Malcolm Bruce called on Ms Sturgeon to make clear whether she still supports the reversal of welfare changes made since 2010. He said: 'The SNP need to come clean. Are they planning to reverse welfare changes since 2010? 'This is what they have spent five years telling people. If so, where are they going to find the money that they have said would be \u00a32.5 billion for Scotland alone? 'If they are not, people will expect them to admit that they are not going back to 2010. 'SNP voters will believe they've been led up the garden path. 'Only Liberal Democrats have set out costed and credible plans to balance the books by 2018, building a stronger economy and a fairer society.

Zbigniew Huminski, 38, has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe, yesterday afternoon in France \u2018while drunk\u2019. She was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into Huminski\u2019s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the UK. Scroll down for video . On his way to Britain: Zbigniew Huminski (left), 38, has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (right), yesterday afternoon in France \u2018while drunk\u2019 Horrifying: The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken . Chloe\u2019s mother, named only as Isabelle, \u2018heard her daughter\u2019s screams\u2019 as she was being taken away from outside her school in Calais - but was unable to do anything. Jean Pierre Valensi, the prosecutor of nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer, said Huminski was arrested hours later and \u2018immediately recognised his involvement in the murder of the child.\u2019 DNA evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed \u2018strangulation and sexual violence\u2019, said Mr Valensi. Tests also showed Huminski was over the alcohol limit for driving. Huminski had been banned from French territory after being convicted twice for acts of \u2018extreme violence\u2019 including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife. But he had driven to France in a Polish registered car this week, and intended to travel to Britain to stay with family\u00a0who had emigrated there, said Mr Valensi. Chloe was playing with a friend on Wednesday afternoon when she approached Huminski, who had stopped his car to drink a beer, and squirted him with her water pistol. Remembered: Relatives of Chloe are joined in a march in Calais today following the nine-year-old girl's death . Walking together: The Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart (right) and the mother (centre) of Chloe, identified only as Isabelle, leave Calais city hill with relatives today . The Pole later told French Police that he grabbed her and forced her into his red Seat Toledo before driving her three miles to the nearby Dubrulle Wood. Isabelle, who had left briefly to take her son to a sports match, began screaming the moment she saw the man, described by witnesses as bald and wearing sunglasses, pushing Chloe into his car. The car, which had Polish number plates, was found by police near where Chloe was killed. Isabelle did not even have time to reach Chloe's father so they could launch a formal missing persons appeal before her body was discovered. 'I've begun to understand I will never see Chloe again,' Isabelle told\u00a0Le Parisien. 'It's tough. Very hard. Above all, I do not know when or how I'm going to tell his little sister and little brother. They are only five and four years old, I do not know if they can understand.' Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s,\u00a0and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his criminal background, and then said he wanted to go and live with his sister in England. Huminski was on his way to Southampton, where his sister lives, French prosecutors confirmed tonight. Flowers: Ms Bouchart (left) comforts Isabelle (right), as relatives and people gather during a march in Calais . Emotional day: A person holds a portrait during a march in Calais in homage to the nine-year-old girl . In 2009 he was lodging in Calais with a Bulgarian immigrant when he attacked a pensioner in her own home, tying her up, before running away with the equivalent of \u00a350 in cash. Psychiatric reports presented in court portrayed Huminiski as a \u2018chronic alcoholic\u2019 known for violent burglaries in both France and Britain. He was last convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early on March 27, 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at Huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled her into the back of his red Seat Toledo at about 3.30pm yesterday, the prosecutor said. The child\u2019s body was found around two hours later, three miles away in the Dubrulle Wood. Sadness: Women place flowers at a playground in the neighbourhood where Chloe was taken yesterday . Distraught: Today people laid flowers at the place where the girl was snatched by the Polish man (pictured) Until a few weeks ago, it was the site of a large immigrant camp, made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of England. Such camps are regularly razed by the French authorities, with the migrants moved on. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: \u2018I was informed at 4.30pm that a young girl was abducted by a man in a red car as she left school in the Chateaubriand area of Calais, at around 3.30pm. A city security chief found an empty red car registered in Poland in Dubrulle Wood, in the north of the city. \u2018He then called the police, who found the body of the girl in the woods. During the same patrol, they found the person who owned the vehicle, apparently a Polish national.\u2019 The mayor has been at the forefront of a campaign to clear out all illegal migrants from her city, saying they are behind all kinds of crimes in the region. Tragic decision: Chloe's mother had let her continue playing in Calais because it was nice outside . Shocking: Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Valensi (pictured) said forensic investigators reported evidence of 'strangulation and sexual violence', and that the Polish man in question had admitted to the killing . The mother of a child who went to school with Chloe told Agence France-Presse: \u2018It's horrific. My son knew her, he didn't sleep last night. He knows he will never see her again. I can't even imagine what the parents are going through.\u2019 French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for light to be shed on the suspect's history, saying the family and community were 'deeply shocked' by the murder. 'It is up to the legal system now to carry out the investigation and what we owe to the family is the whole truth,' he said. Calais was plunged into mourning after the killing of the girl described as 'cheerful and full of life'. Residents planned a march in memory of Chloe today. Flags in the town were already being flown at half mast. Huminski will now be kept in custody pending a criminal trial for murder.",

        "text": "A new study has shown women still have an increased risk of breast cancer years after stopping taking hormone replacement therapy . Hormone replacement therapy increases a woman's risk of breast cancer up to eight years after she has stopped treatment, scientists have warned. The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT \u00a0- where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK \u00a0another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment. WHI researchers had intended to follow the women up until 2005, but in 2002 it became clear women taking HRT were suffering higher rates of heart disease. Those women who took the combined HRT, which boosts the body's levels of both female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after treatment . They discovered it was the women taking either the combination HRT or those taking oestrogen-only treatment that were going on to suffer heart problems. As a result, all women were asked to stop taking their treatment - HRT or placebo - immediately. After the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined HRT, use of the therapy dropped dramatically. The new study, led by Dr Rowan Chlebowski, an oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, and one of the initial investigators on WHI, focused on a woman's risk of breast cancer after stopping HRT treatment. He told Time: 'It looks like hormones have longer term lingering effects. 'For oestrogen and progesterone together, we see an increase in risk - even years after you stop. 'But for oestrogen alone, it looks like the hormone may be more favourable in reducing breast cancer risk than we thought before. 'The oestrogen alone findings are now quite compelling that we may have to call it risk reduction.' In total, researchers examined 27,347 women aged 50 to 79 years old, who had been through the menopause. They had all taken part in two previous WHI studies, having enrolled at 40 centres across the US from 1993 to 1998. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK are the two largest studies into the effects of HRT. Both found strong evidence the treatment increases a woman's risk of breast cancer, pictured, with the latter finding it doubled a woman's risk . In the first two years, after stopping HRT treatment, researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone. But the study authors noted: 'Subsequently, breast cancer risk increased throughout the intervention phase and became statistically significant.' Even up to five-and-a-half years later, breast cancer risk remained high. In addition, the researchers note that at an eight-year follow-up a 'risk reduction was not observed'. But for those women taking oestrogen only treatment, the risk for invasive breast cancer fell. However, despite the findings, Dr Chlebowski urged caution. He said while the results do show a higher than normal risk of breast cancer years after stopping HRT, it is only 'a little more risk than we thought with oestrogen and progesterone'. 'But it's always difficult to figure out how to categorise that risk,' he added. 'It's different for each woman.'",
        "generated": "A new study has shown that women who have stopped taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) still have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after stopping treatment. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both shown strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb, and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study found that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. Researchers have warned that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, even up to eight years after stopping treatment. However, they found that women who take oestrogen-only HRT have a decreased risk of invasive breast cancer.

        "text": "Fox News anchor Chris Wallace has issued an apology after 'fat shaming' Kelly Clarkson in a radio interview, saying that he should have spoken of the singer's 'remarkable talent', not her weight. During the interview with conservative talk show host, Mike Gallagher, the 67-year-old was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? You know the singer, Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up.' In reply, he said the 'American Idol' winner has 'a lovely voice', but added that she 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'. Within minutes, Wallace's response had sparked outrage online. Now, the veteran news man has apologized for his 'offensive' remarks - which he made on the nationally-syndicated Mike Gallagher Show on Friday - in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR 'FAT SHAMING' INTERVIEW . Firestorm: Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace (right), 67, faced wide-spread criticism after fat shaming Kelly Clarkson (left) on Friday, saying the singer and new mom could 'stay off the deep dish pizza for a while' Dealing with it: The same day, Kelly Clarkson told chat show host Ellen DeGeneres that she's had to deal with criticism about her weight since she first hit the spotlighton the first season of American Idol in 2002 . In the statement, Wallace said: 'I sincerely apologize to Kelly Clarkson for my offensive comment. I admire her remarkable talent and that should have been the focus of any discussion about her.' Clarkson, who coincidentally spoke of criticism about her weight on\u00a0The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u00a0the same day, is married to talent manager Brandon Blackstock. They have a nine-month-old girl, River. Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, 60-year-old Greta Van Susteren, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to\u00a0Gallagher. 'This \"guy snickering\" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter users condemned Wallace for his 'disgusting' remarks. One wrote: 'Chris Wallace you're disgusting how dare you fat shame a woman who gave birth less than a year ago.' During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Clarkson\u00a0revealed that since she appeared on 'American Idol' in 2002, she has had to  deal with people being mean about her body shape. On Kelly's side: Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, Greta Van Susteren (above), 60, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Mike Gallagher . Tweet: 'This \"guy snickering\" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote . Mom-and-baby bag: Ellen surprised Kelly, whose daughter River was born in June 2014, with a baby bag that dispenses 'mommy juice' after the singer said she sometimes prefers wine to workouts on Friday's show . 'I was the biggest girl in the show, too. And I wasn\u2019t big, but people would call me big. Because I was the biggest one on Idol and I\u2019ve kind of always gotten that,' she told the  host. Referring to British TV personality, Katie Hopkins, who has tweeted a string of rude comments about her, she added: 'People are like, I\u2019m so sorry that lady in London was so mean to you. 'I\u2019m like, are you serious?\u00a0Like\u00a0get in line.' In an interview with Access Hollywood in early March, Hopkins, 40, defended her position on the Heartbeat Song artist, declaring that 'ultimately, Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey.' Proud mom: The singer brought along her adorable nine-month-old daughter River and introduced her to the comedienne backstage at The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Happy and successful: Kelly's new album Piece By Piece debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her third number one album . But Clarkson told Ellen she feels bad not for herself but for other woman. 'I think what hurts my feelings... is that I\u2019ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you\u2019re big, I must be so fat to them\", she said. The new mother, who gave birth to her daughter in June 2014, revealed on the popular TV chat show that she takes a philosophical approach to comments about what she looks like. 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' the 32-year-old said. She added: 'I\u2019m such a creative person that I\u00a0yoyo.\u00a0So sometimes I\u2019m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don\u2019t and I\u2019m like.. I\u2019d rather have wine.'",

Our glorious spring has accelerated the growing season - and supermarket shelves are already bursting with English summer fruit and veg. Usually at this time of year we would still be eating vegetables imported from Spain and South America. But thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual. Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year. It is stocking large Jack Hawkins, aromatic Red Choice and tiny Baby Plums, all grown in greenhouses across England. And the supermarket has been stocking asparagus since the beginning of the month. Strawberries are also already on the shelves - far earlier than normal - and English raspberries saw their earliest ever appearance in the last week of March. Morrisons, meanwhile, yesterday predicted Britain would have best crop of asparagus for nearly a decade. The chain estimates that the asparagus crop could be up 20 per cent this year compared to average, having received an early boost of high light levels and warm temperatures. Morrisons asparagus buyer David Bartle said: \u2018Growing conditions look like they are going to be perfect. \u2018The good weather will not only affect the amount of asparagus grown but also the quality of the crop. We could have the most exceptional year since 2007.\u2019 Peter Cooke, Waitrose vegetable buyer, said: \u2018Our customers can choose from a wide variety of home grown tomatoes and in bigger quantities than this time last year.\u2019 The sunny spell is set to continue until later this week, when the weather will take a turn for the worst. The mercury is set to hit 21C (70F) as the Queen celebrates her 89th birthday today (Tuesday) - making it hotter than Ibiza, Athens and Barcelona.

        "text": "The Manchester derby is now one of the biggest match-ups in world football. Millions across the globe cram around TV screens to catch a glimpse of the fixture, and its appeal gets ever greater with each passing season. But just how Manchester is the clash between City and United? Sportsmail takes a look at everything local between the two giants. Sergio Aguero and Manchester City travel to Old Trafford to face United on Sunday afternoon . Owners . You will not find many United fans who pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost at Old Trafford. Despite being the man who brought Sir Alex Ferguson to the club and backed him when many wanted him sacked, former chairman Edwards (who was later cautioned after a peeping tom episode in a ladies toilet) remained a figure of distrust. Likewise, there will not be many City supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former TV salesman and combover king Peter Swales, who often came across as out of tune with reality (if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief-defying City! documentary on YouTube), as he went through manager after manager after manager. Peter Swailes was local, but not many Manchester City fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship . Not many United fans pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost . Sheikh Mansour might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at Manchester City after bankrolling the club . Avram (left) and Joel Glazer have proved divisive figures at United since their family bought the club . At Old Trafford, there remains a resentment for those upstairs. That the owners are from Tampa and not Timperley, however, is irrelevant. The Glazer family could be from Timbuktu - their cash-draining tenure is still hard to take even though the yellow and green scarves are not as easy to spot. Across town, however, the sheikh who shook it up for the Blues is a hero. Is there a more popular owner in football? While City fans may no longer (thankfully) pay homage by wearing Arabic robes or waving \u00a320 notes in the air, the man from Abu Dhabi is adored. Managers . It has always been rare to find a football club with a hometown manager. However, you do get the sense that both Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini do their best to familairise themselves with their environment. Van Gaal has taken a lot of local knowledge from Ryan Giggs. More than once the Dutchman has asked the son of Salford (via Cardiff) to speak to the players about the opposition and tell them exactly what victory would mean to the supporters. Giggs, a fierce Red, is said to have come into his own when Liverpool were next up. Louis van Gaal has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer . Van Gaal has leaned on assistant boss Ryan Giggs for tips around the city during his stint in charge . Manuel Pellegrini has been keen to familiarise himself with Manchester over the last two years . Manager Pellegrini with chairman\u00a0Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) over in Abu Dhabi last May . Van Gaal, who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel, frequented many of the city's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town. While you won't see Pellegrini supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of LS Lowry in city centre backstreet boozer Sam's Chop House, the Chilean has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture. Not too long after his arrival he was spotted in a Hale picture shop, having maps of the local area framed for his walls. However, when this reporter once asked him if he had been anywhere nice during his time off the answer of 'York' was not what was expected. Coaches . The aforementioned Giggs, as assistant manager, gives the coaching staff at Old Trafford a homegrown element. Brian Kidd (right, at Crystal Palace on Monday) is Manchester through and through . Kidd is\u00a0more Mancunian than Happy Mondays dancer Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain . Unless Tyler Blackett makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs . Aside from the local lad, the only things missing from Carrington are a windmill and some tulips with Dutch quintet Frans Hoek, Albert Stuivenberg, Marcel Bout, Jos van Dijk and Max Reckers key players. It is a similar situation at City with Brian Kidd, more Mancunian than Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain, co-assistant manager alongside a number of the boss's trusted lieutenants. Fiery Argentinian Ruben Cousillas splits responsibilities with Kidd while goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancisidor and Jose Cabello, both Spaniards, complete the Latin look. Players . Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . Wayne Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. There will be Italians, Argentines, Spaniards, Ivorians and maybe even a Colombian, but unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Van Gaal's line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Fans . Interest in the derby will be spread all over the world. United like to remind us of their 659m global followers while City, according to a recent club-commissioned report, have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet. Outside Old Trafford, street vendors will attempt to flog half-and-half scarves. Some of the tourists may even buy them. Manchester City fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of 'empty seats' at the Etihad Stadium . Regardless, nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in Manchester. No United fans from Manchester? City fans all from Stockport? Nonsense. Ask any Red or Blue if they fancy going into work on Monday after a derby loss and they will give you the same answer. While City fans may serenade their hosts with 'You're the pride of Singapore' and United supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at 'the council house' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties.",

The deal comes after the league has been dogged for years by complaints that it long hid the risks of repeated concussions in order to return players to the field. The NFL expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. The settlement approved on Wednesday by a federal judge in Philadelphia would pay them about $190,000 on average. Senior US District Judge Anita Brody (left) approved the deal on Wednesday after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. Former Philadelphia Eagles fullback Kevin Turner (right) suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease and led the lawsuit against the NFL . The settlement also includes allowing for monetary awards of up to $5million per claimant for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody approved the deal after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. The negotiators did not increase the original $765million plan, but agreed to remove that number as the cap. The deal means the NFL may never have to disclose what it knew when about the risks and treatment of concussions. Players' lawyers have argued that the settlement will help families get needed financial awards or medical testing that might take years if the case went to trial. The league expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (above)\u00a0has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions . The league's top lawyer said Brody's approval 'powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety' of the settlement. 'Retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that \u2014 as Judge Brody's comprehensive opinion makes clear \u2014 would have an uncertain prospect of success,' NFL general counsel Jeff Pash said in a statement. The total NFL payouts over 65 years, including interest and $112million sought for lawyer fees, is expected to be more than $1billion. Critics contend the NFL is getting off lightly given annual revenues of about $10billion. However, plaintiffs would have first had to fight their way into court \u2014 instead of getting booted to NFL mediation under their players' contracts \u2014 to prevail. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually including the family of former New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau (above) Seau (above) committed suicide at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE . 'From a business point of view, (the NFL has)...avoided what may have been the biggest risk to their continued prosperity,' said Andrew Brandt, director of the sports law program at Villanova University law school. 'Removing this as a threat is extraordinary,' he said. The NFL lawsuits, and similar suits filed later against the NHL, the NCAA and others, has fostered debate, discussion and safety reforms about sports concussions. Yet the NFL games seem to be as wildly popular as ever. 'I know people talk about, it's dangerous, and mothers won't let their sons play football. But I don't see that. I don't see that at all,' Brandt said. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually. They include the family of Junior Seau, the popular Pro Bowler who killed himself at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The NFL earlier this year said concussions have dropped by 36 per cent after they changed the way players tackle (above David Bruton #30 of the Denver Broncos lies on the ground in pain in 2014) Brody most recently asked for several tweaks, including partial credit for time played in NFL Europe and other developmental leagues, to broaden the settlement. Negotiators quickly agreed to her suggestions. She rejected other complaints raised at a November hearing, including those who say the agreement does not cover future deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after death, or contemplate the day when it might be diagnosed in the living. Others oppose the award reductions for older men and those who played fewer than five years in the league. 'Although objectors insist that there must be compensation for CTE, the NFL parties were unwilling to settle claims based solely on a (diagnosis) ... rather than on manifest neurocognitive deficits,' the lead negotiators wrote in a March court filing urging Brody to approve the deal. 'Many of the behavioral and mood conditions claimed to be associated with CTE are prevalent within the general public.'",
