        "text": "On the living room mantelpiece of Yinka Shonibare's house in east London sits another house. It is a scale, doll-sized model, although the d\u00e9cor - diminutive dining table and chairs, four-poster bed, and a framed print of an old master painting \u2013 differs from the real version, which Shonibare has filled with works by fellow artists. A painted sign by Bob and Roberta Smith hangs on one wall, alongside a work by Hew Locke \u2013 a sinister, floor-length photograph of what looks like a south-east Asian tribesman wielding an array of knives.\n\nShonibare has more in common with Locke than simply owning his work. Both artists are previous recipients of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation award for visual arts. The awards carry big money \u2013 currently \u00a345,000, spread over three years \u2013 significant enough to change the lives of its recipients. Yet, compared with higher-profile, headline-grabbing prizes such as the Turner (this year's winners of which will be announced a week today), the Paul Hamlyn - named after the late publisher and philanthropist - is barely ever talked about outside the art world.\n\nThe awards were originally set up in 1994 to provide composers with enough cash to allow them to concentrate on developing their ideas over a three-year period. They were expanded in 1998 \u2013 the year Shonibare was a winner \u2013 to include those working in the visual arts. Since then, they have been awarded to some of the best-known artists around today, from Shonibare and Locke to Jeremy Deller, Gustav Metzger, Mike Nelson and Tomma Abts. The Turner, for which Shonibare was himself nominated in 2004, may exceed the Paul Hamlyn in terms of sheer, brassy glamour, but those who have benefited from the Paul Hamlyn are almost evangelical about its value to their career and confidence.\n\nIn 1998, Shonibare was working three days a week as a development officer for the disability arts organisation, Shape; the rest of his time was devoted to delivering a rapidly increasing number of commissions, and demands for shows. He felt, he says, \"that it was a sort of catch-22 thing. If you still have a part-time job you can't really throw yourself in fully. While I liked the job, my art career was also building. So it was really hard - like pulling myself between the two things.\"\n\nWhen he won the award, however, Shonibare was able to resign and concentrate on his art full-time. It was in the very fact of being able to stop worrying about money that, somewhat ironically, he began to make some. \"Not only did the award give me confidence,\" he says, \"it just took away the worry of money, because that can be very distracting. And actually, being able to switch to the [art] work then subsequently produced more money.\"\n\nPerformance artist Rose English, who won a Paul Hamlyn award the year after Shonibare, agrees. Her multidisciplinary work is difficult to quantify, which meant she had, she says, been finding it very difficult to secure funding \u2013 especially to work on ideas. Public funding tends to require the applicant to create a particular, tangible project (such as a stage show or exhibition), while an award such as the Turner retrospectively recognises a successful show or body of work; the aim of the Paul Hamlyn is to give the artist the breathing space to develop fresh ideas. \"The fact that there were no strings attached was very valuable,\" English says. \"There was no specific play or performance to get together.\"\n\nEnglish did, nonetheless, use the three years financed by the award both to stage a musical performance, Standing Room Only, in London (she had been planning it for years, but had not yet secured funding); and to research a longer-term project. Called Lost in Music, it's a performance piece using acrobatics, singing, fire, and, intriguingly, glass, and it will be produced and performed next year in China. \"I was able to just batten down the hatches,\" English says of those three years, \"and get on with it.\"\n\nEnglish also found her confidence boosted by the knowledge that other artists had been involved in making the decision, rather than the distant, grey-suited bureaucrats more readily associated with public funding. This year among the art world luminaries who helped to choose the shortlist were artist Rachel Whiteread, Serpentine director Hans Ulrich Oberst, and Whitechapel Gallery curator Anthony Spira. The winners are then chosen by a smaller team of judges (this year, the Guardian's Adrian Searle; Paul Hamlyn's daughter, gallery owner and chair of the foundation Jane Hamlyn; and Baltic director Godfrey Worsdale).\n\nTo win, therefore, is to gain a vote of confidence from the people whose opinion matters most \u2013 curators, gallerists and, most importantly, other artists. \"To know that these people whose opinion I valued had actually chosen me,\" English says, \"made me feel such a connection with them.\" Shonibare goes even further: \"Paul Hamlyn has something that the Turner doesn't have \u2026 It has peer respect.\"\n\nWhere Hamlyn also differs from the Turner is in age criteria: the Turner is only open to artists under the age of 50, but artists of any age are eligible for the Paul Hamlyn. Gustav Metzger was 80 when he won the award in 2006; the film-maker and photographer Horace Ov\u00e9 was 69. The Trinidadian-born Ov\u00e9 is using his award to transfer his career-long archive of works between the Caribbean and the UK, and to focus on his photography (planned projects include a trip to Congo). \"Winning the Paul Hamlyn has been very, very helpful to me,\" he says.\n\nFor Shonibare, there is nonetheless a tangible correlation, at least among the younger artists, between Paul Hamlyn winners and Turner prize nominees. \"If you look up all the artists who've been nominated for the Turner in the last 10 years,\" he says, \"you will find that prior to the Turner nomination, a lot of them actually received the Paul Hamlyn.\" So did Shonibare actually find winning the Paul Hamlyn as significant as being nominated for the Turner? \"They're two very different things,\" he says tactfully. \"Paul Hamlyn is very low-key; it's very discreet, publicity-wise. You have to have really thick skin when you do the Turner, because people will just hurl abuse at you from every corner. Even cab drivers have an opinion. You wouldn't get into a cab and find the driver discussing the Paul Hamlyn.\"\n\nAlthough Shonibare won the popular vote at the time of his nomination (64% of visitors to the BBC website said they wanted him to win), he says he still suffered his fair share of abuse. \"The Turner is great,\" he says, \"but it has all other kinds of agendas attached to it. It's more about popular culture, more about the media opportunity to dislike contemporary art. The press love to rubbish art - with the Turner they do it every year. The Paul Hamlyn doesn't get into any of that. It's a serious award. It's not being dragged into the gutter.\"\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday November 25 2008.

        "text": "Manet was the last French painter to love black for a very long time. The museum habit of placing him among the Impressionists has a curious effect. In New York's Metropolitan Museum, stepping from the interminable Renoir rooms into the Manet room produces a shock; stepping back produces another one, not quite in reverse. Renoir, who believed and said that black did not exist, that all shadows had a colour, apparently succeeded a painter who loved the knife-edge contrasts of black. The intense matadors of Manet give way to the smiling pastel matrons of Renoir; dramatic costumes, as if for a stage performance or a last appearance in the arena, are succeeded by a natural sincerity. Black disappeared after Manet, not to reappear until Matisse. Pleasingly, the aged Renoir lived to be deeply shocked by the black horizontal bar in Matisse's Int\u00e9rieur \u00e0 Nice, now in Philadelphia.\n\nVisitors to the Royal Academy's new blockbuster Manet exhibition will be immediately struck by the glowering, Spanish-flavoured black, which separates him so strongly from the next generation. But on the other hand, there are aspects of Manet's painterly practice that root him powerfully in his own time, and strongly influenced the generations that followed \u2013 not just in painting. The age was one that was fascinated by what Gerard Manley Hopkins was to call \"dappled things\" \u2013 the effect of coupled light and dark in flecks and movement under trees and in urban shade. \"All things counter, original, spare, strange; whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?) with swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim\"; Hopkins' catalogue starts to surface elsewhere, in Manet's first mature paintings, and maintains a powerful presence in the art, music and above all painting of the rest of the century.\n\nDapplement surfaces in the great Musique dans les Jardins des Tuileries of 1862, somehow both epic and domestic in scale, and is the thing that saves it from direct comparison with the social panoramas of William Powell Frith, across the Channel. An all-enveloping rippling light turns it into a study of atmosphere. Dapplement, with its unpredictable emphases and shadows, its world of half-glimpses and dramatic clarity, determines what meaning Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe might possess. Dapplement had occasionally interested earlier painters, and Le Linge of 1875 pays some homage to the great series of laundress paintings of Fragonard, a century before, where the figures are almost lost in bursts of light falling on steam.\n\nA subsequent generation, including Renoir in the Bal du Moulin de la Galette, which recapitulates Musique dans les Jardins des Tuileries, used dapplement to create a rippling uniformity in a diverse scene. Manet's fascination was rather different. It is used to demonstrate the unpredictable object, the startling contrast, the grotesque event with the unexpected fall of direct light amid shade. It combines the detailed passage with a grand sweep of crepuscular shade, the closely observed with the mysteriously vague. Dapplement was a tool for him, like the sudden emergence of a social group into the light from deep shade, like the curious group in Le Balcon at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, or the great Dejeuner dans l'Atelier in Munich. It froze a moment in all its curious combinations, as photography was one day to do. Dapplement in Manet is much more like the dappled observations of his friend Chabrier's piano piece \"Sous-bois\" \u2013 a work so strange I remember repeatedly stopping while learning it as a boy, unable to believe that a composer of the 1870s could intend these sounds. Manet's late Un Bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re hung over Chabrier's piano; it is nice to think of the mercurial musician looking up as he played. Manet's dapplement resembles the gorgeous and unpredictable shifts between soloist, septet, chorus and orchestra, between foreground and sweeping backdrop, which Berlioz found for the end of the fourth act of Les Troyens in the late 1850s. It resembles, too, the bizarre juxtapositions in Madame Bovary, such as the declarations of love against the cries of an agricultural auction, and, much later, the freakish shifts of direction in the poetry of Manet's friend Mallarm\u00e9 \u2013 his early \"L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune\", like the Debussy orchestral prelude, is an ode to dappled light and the bizarre, erotic contrasts it produces.\n\nManet's art is devoted to the wrong thing in the wrong place, unpredictably caught out and spotlit by the fall of light or the pitiless gaze. Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe, with its outrageous combination of clothed male figures and nude, or deshabill\u00e9 women, was defended by Zola on the grounds of classical precedent. (Not quite as much as Zola claims, however.) There are Giorgione landscapes and Titian interiors that exploit the same contrast. But Manet's point is the indecency of the contrast in a contemporary context \u2013 the very fashionable little tassled cap on the head of one of the men is the most obscene thing in the painting. Similarly, in the sumptuous Olympia, what turns the nude into a shocking study of a prostitute? It is the clothes \u2013 the clothes the maid wears, the orchid in the hair, the black ribbon about the neck, the pearl earrings and the bracelet, and above all, the slippers \u2013 that transform the nude. There are franker 19th-century studies of the female form, such as Courbet's Origine du Monde, but none so ingeniously obscene.\n\nDressing up is the source of much joy and bizarre contrast in Manet. Go back to the incomparable Manet room in the Metropolitan, and look around. The beautiful Mlle V en Costume d'Espada has the face of a handsome boy, and would pass as a matador but for one thing \u2013 the painter's voluptuous enjoyment of her unmistakably feminine bottom and swelling belly. Next to that, an absurdly upright 1866 matador with showy, excessive sideburns seems to be dressing up as a man, too, as does the little boy with a serious expression carrying a sword that is far too big for him. And then the limp Christ with the angels, their expressions not sweet and generalised, but very much studies of hard-faced Parisian women, perhaps women whose trade is the laying out of corpses \u2013 what to make of that? Was Manet quite serious?\n\nManet retained a detached relationship to the subject matter of paintings that challenged even the most sympathetically inclined of his contemporaries. Gautier was alarmed by the combination of realism and topic in Le Christ Mort et les Anges. Zola, in the course of his spirited defence of Manet, was not quite right to say:\"Feeling that he was making no progress by copying the masters, or by painting Nature as seen through the eyes of individuals who differed in character from himself,\" Manet \"came to understand, quite naturally, one fine day, that it only remained to him to see Nature as it really is, without looking at the works or studying the opinions of others.\" The detachment from artistic tradition comes not through complete freedom, but from a willingness to examine and break the rules of presentation. This urge has, it turns out, resulted in a series of cunning traps laid for the oversophisticated. There is a large body of critical work about Manet's last major painting, Un Bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re, either decrying its impossible depiction of a reflection, or talking about the subtle fantasy that results from this impossibility. It took until 2001, and the reconstruction of the image by an Australian art historian, Malcolm Park, before the scene was shown to be perfectly plausible. Manet had just taken the greatest care to make the scene look as impossible, and indeed ineptly constructed, as he knew how.\n\nPortraiture, which is the focus of the Royal Academy's show, had become still more hidebound by the advent and influence of photography. As one of the great early photographers, Nadar, remarked in his autobiography, the advent of the carte de visite type of photographic portrait \"spelled disaster. Either you had to succumb \u2013 that is, follow the trend \u2013 or resign.\" Carol M Armstrong reminds us in the RA catalogue that Manet's friend Baudelaire had been similarly scathing about photography's impact on society in his Salon of 1859, speaking of the moment when \"our squalid society rushed, Narcissus to a man, to gaze at its trivial image on a scrap of metal\".\n\nManet's portraiture is devoted to the image that is controlled not by the conventions of the form, still less of the acceptable conventions of emerging photography portraiture, but by the gaze of the artist. If some of the portraits, such as the famous one of Zola, follow the conventional format established by Ingr\u00e8s, others, such as the portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 or La Dame aux Eventails in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, return to the fantasy portraits of Fragonard, and seem to draw inspiration from a blurred photographic print. Others revel in the momentary impression, even of a face glimpsed in the street in a dumpy, unconsidered posture in mid-movement, as if thinking that painting could achieve through imaginative action what photography, as yet, was not technically capable of. In the portrait Berthe Morisot au Bouquet de Violettes she is caught between poses, slowly moving into an amused smile. There are curious urban scenes to make Diane Arbus wonder; the grouping of the balcony, or the marvellously awkward and grumpy mother and daughter against the strangest of geometric backdrops in Le Chemin de Fer, now in Washington DC. These are moments that might have been glimpsed in the street, from the window of a moving hansom cab, by a device not yet perfected. Or alternatively, by an unresting and ceaselessly inventive eye, with a perfect visual memory, apparently in need of little mechanical help. It is difficult to tell.\n\nZola was quite right to base his defence of Manet on the painter's perfect eye. It was an eye of great purity, and one that came to an ironic and undermining position after the long years of argumentative apprenticeship in the studio of Manet's master, the salon painter Thomas Couture. (The scholar Beatrice Farwell remarks, surprisingly, that Manet was \"the last great French painter to receive a long and academic training\".) What the eye saw, however, was not completely unprejudiced. It was the observation of the visual moments that would most offend, most alarm, most bewilder; a face in a street, a line of railings and a suggestion of rising steam, a momentary pattern of dappled light that reveals, of all things, a naked woman sitting with two well-off young men in a forest glade, turning and smiling. What do these things mean? The startled eye closes; turns away; turns to something else, with amusement, but no certain claim to be making any kind of statement about anything but the fall of light.",

        "text": "History has been overly kind to \u201cFull House.\u201d Though it\u2019s now seen \u2014 through the obfuscating fog of nostalgia \u2014 as a classic family sitcom, the show was also archetypally average, hiding behind a ubiquitous laugh track and obnoxiously on-the-nose life lessons. It may well have been a television touchstone, but it was also the equivalent of a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup: fluffy, insubstantial, and so sickly sweet it could induce toothaches.\n\nSo when it was announced that Netflix planned to brush away the cobwebs for a new series dubbed \u201cFuller House,\u201d one question immediately arose: Why? Why this sitcom? Why does the original, which ran from 1987 to 1995, warrant a second serving, especially in a TV landscape already populated by series like \u201cModern Family,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d all of which mark smarter, more inclusive evolutions of the \u201cFull House\u201d formula?\n\nWell, as it turns out, the answer\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t, at all. In the six episodes sent to critics, \u201cFuller House\u201d suggests a raison d\u2019\u00eatre that amounts to little more than fan service of the most bare-faced, blaring variety.\n\nAs the pilot, by far the worst installment, teases out one familiar face after another (minus the Olsen twins, who get a fourth-wall-breaking admonishment for sitting this one out), an excess of communal back-patting takes center stage. \u201cDamn, we all still look good,\u201d Uncle Jesse (John Stamos, who admittedly does still look very good) even says at one point.\n\nBut like most of the shout-outs in \u201cFuller House,\u201d that line feels like less of a triumphant, meta declaration and more of a plea for fan validation. Jesse shouldn\u2019t sound so desperate. The live studio audience, of course, is ready with a hero\u2019s welcome, not just for Stamos but also Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, and Scott Weinger.\n\nHowever, the joy that hardcore fans will find in seeing this crew reassembled mostly intact is short-lived. At premiere\u2019s end, most of them hit the road, destined to flit back for occasional cameos, and the gender-flipped conceit of this new take becomes apparent: a widowed D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Cameron Bure) winds up installed in the San Francisco house, alongside sister Stephanie (Sweetin) and pal Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber), both of whom agree to help her raise a trio of young boys.\n\nThere will be three schools of thought around how \u201cFuller House\u201d riffs on the original\u2019s premise. Some may praise the absence of a domineering patriarch, seeing the freshly forged Tanner-Fuller-Gibbler triumvirate as a commendably feminist foundation. Others will likely fault the series for how it regressively encourages its three female leads to answer the call of motherhood and ditch any professional or personal ventures that could get in the way. And others still (the ones Netflix is really catering to) won\u2019t care to consider either thematic implication, instead relishing every stock plot, speech, and group hug the show has to offer, just as one relishes comfort food on a lazy Sunday morning.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub \u2014 with \u201cFuller House,\u201d Netflix has created its first critic-proof series. It\u2019s easy to wish everyone involved with this revival had been concerned with something more honorable than narcissistic self-celebration. Furthermore, in 2016, it\u2019s fair enough to look upon trite laughs, cloyingly sentimental touches, and cutesy diversions (a baby here, a puppy there) with some degree of distaste. If \u201cFull House\u201d had aired this year, it \u2014 like its sequel \u2014 would pale in comparison to practically everything else on offer. As such, most sitcom aficionados will find they\u2019ve outgrown the Tanner clan.\n\nNetflix knows it only has to please the ones who haven\u2019t, for whom seeing this mix of new and old characters run through the motions will feel like going back to the glory days of the sitcom itself. Bashing those folks is futile \u2014 let them enjoy this hollow exercise in nostalgia. But for the rest of us, \u201cFuller House\u201d never justifies its own existence, let alone why the uninitiated should give it a chance.",

        "text": "In recent weeks, \u201cGirls\u201d has put two central characters in a difficult spot \u2014 the classic \u201cill-fated love\u201d spot. Jessa and Adam, the show\u2019s two towering infernos, are enormously attracted to each other. But Jessa really doesn\u2019t want to hurt the prickly Hannah, her best friend and Adam\u2019s ex. Adam keeps aggressively courting Jessa, but she keeps fighting his efforts, trying to alter her lifelong pattern of unscrupulous, impulsive choices.\n\nActually, \u201cGirls\u201d is putting viewers in a difficult spot. too. It\u2019s obvious that Jessa and Adam, both looming physical presences, could make a great couple. They seem to belong together, in that somewhat indescribable but natural way, unlike Hannah and Adam, who never appreciated each other and were forever parsing misunderstandings. We\u2019ve watched the Jessa-Adam chemistry grow, as they\u2019ve toyed with friendship born of mutual sobriety. We\u2019ve seen that even the actors who play Adam and Jessa, Adam Driver and Jemima Kirke, click organically. But we know about the Ex Code \u2014 that you don\u2019t date your friends\u2019 past loves \u2014 and Hannah and her inevitably dramatic feelings of betrayal hang over all of us.\n\nOn many shows, this kind of three-way crash is something of a time killer. The lead guy and gal are clearly going to get there, with their wedding serving as one of the season finales, or even as the series finale. They are the show\u2019s fated pair, and that is the subtext of everything they do. But the writers need to find obstacles in the meantime, to fuel seasons of episodes. So they bring in a third player. On \u201cFriends,\u201d we knew all along that Ross and Rachel would wind up together, that they were \u201cmeant to be.\u201d But nonetheless we had to go through a ridiculous dating period between Joey and Rachel, as if. \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d played the same game, steering Robin into Barney\u2019s arms \u2014 even marrying them \u2014 while all along we felt in our heart of hearts that she\u2019d wind up with Ted, which she did.\n\nSometimes, though, writers fool with the fated-couple expectation, that often wearying clich\u00e9, and it can work perfectly. The best example I can think of was on \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d At the start of the series, viewers could easily assume that sensitive boy Dawson would end up with his childhood pal Joey. But as the series developed, it became clear that the endearing innocence of their early bond made them soulmates, but not lovers, and that Joey and Pacey were far more suited for each other romantically. In the end, Joey and Pacey were together, and it felt right.\n\nI certainly thought early in \u201cGirls\u201d that Hannah and Adam were destined to work out, that they\u2019d grow up and together, that he\u2019d be her Mr. Right and her Mr. Big. But the writers have shown the unbearable dysfunction of their relationship in such detail, it seems increasingly possible that Hannah and Adam aren\u2019t going to prevail. Is the Jessa and Adam story a detour, or is it a main thoroughfare to the end of the road, which will be next season? I love the thought that \u201cGirls\u201d would avoid the guaranteed-love formula, that it would follow through with its generally more realistic and honest approach to twentysomething romance in the 2010s.\n\nBy now you can probably tell that I am an Adam and Jessa shipper, that if I wrote fan fiction I would have them together and doing performance art on the streets forevermore. They could be Brooklyn\u2019s bushy, boho birds of a feather, mumblecore\u2019s own Gomez and Morticia Addams. It\u2019s so obvious they are cut from the same cloth; they\u2019re both moody, cryptic, and willfully unpredictable. Perhaps that means that, as Jessa said, a love affair would be a mess: \u201cYou know as well as I do, even if we could be together, even if Hannah didn\u2019t exist, that I would destroy you,\u201d she told him after they spent a carefree day together. \u201cAnd you would destroy me.\u201d I\u2019d definitely like to find out if that\u2019s true.",

The legendary couple appeared to have exactly two things in common: a love of dogs (hence the borzoi colophon) and a desire to publish good books. They began modestly with such disparate titles as \u201cThe Book of Camping\u201d and an anonymous monograph about Ezra Pound, written by T.S. Eliot before he was T.S. Eliot. A reprint of W.H. Hudson\u2019s 1904 novel, \u201cGreen Mansions,\u201d ensured their survival, but it was Blanche\u2019s peculiar astuteness that led to the 1923 publication of Kahlil Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet,\u201d whose modest initial sales would metastasize 40 years later, in the woo-woo \u201960s, helping to lift Knopf into the commercial big-time.\n\nBy the time Blanche died, in 1966, 27 Knopf authors had won the Pulitzer and 16 the Nobel\u2014an astounding record, all the more so given the relatively humble scale of the operation. Only a dozen or so Knopf books sold more than 100,000 copies in those early decades, whereas larger houses such as Doubleday and Simon & Schuster published several best sellers a year. Indeed, it is Laura Claridge\u2019s emphatic thesis, in \u201cThe Lady and the Borzoi,\u201d that Knopf waxed in prestige all but entirely because of its indefatigable matriarch. Not only a \u201csuperb editor of fiction and poetry,\u201d Blanche was also an expert schmoozer who cultivated the advice of her good friends, Carl Van Vechten and H.L. Mencken, while beguiling an international Who\u2019s Who of 20th-century literature: Freud, Mann, Cather, Camus, et al. This, as Ms. Claridge would have it, was almost in spite of her philistine husband, more of a salesman type who read, if at all, the odd history book.\n\nAlfred would have disagreed. Though he\u2019d made a \u201cprenuptial verbal pact\u201d with his wife that they would be equal partners, he was already air-brushing her out of the picture five years later, in 1920, when he printed a booklet of accolades to himself written by Knopf authors whom his wife had largely courted. Ms. Claridge finds a reference, in publisher Desmond Flower\u2019s memoir, to Blanche\u2019s suicide attempt while a guest chez Flower and thus opines (\u201cIt seems possible\u201d) that Blanche was despondent over being omitted from Alfred\u2019s fifth-anniversary Festschrift. If so, her cry for help went unheeded. \u201cDuring the last 20 years,\u201d Alfred announced 15 years later in the Borzoi Quarterly, \u201cI have introduced to America many writers so far ahead of their times that even competent critics found difficulty in adequately appraising their worth and the importance of my discoveries.\u201d Even competent critics! Be that as it may, hope springs eternal, and again, in 1948, Blanche looked forward to a three-part New Yorker magazine profile that promised to belie, at last, her husband\u2019s fondness for the first person. Its title, however, was enough to disabuse her: \u201cPublisher,\u201d singular.\n\nThe florid subtitle of Ms. Claridge\u2019s book, \u201cBlanche Knopf, Literary Tastemaker Extraordinaire,\u201d might as well have been, \u201cAlfred Knopf, Nonpareil Douchebag.\u201d His employees remembered him as insensitive, at best, and a skinflint to boot. It took all of Blanche\u2019s wiles to attract great writers despite the invariably mean royalty advances offered by her husband, who believed that the cachet of Knopf was its own reward. Perhaps it goes without saying that he had a ghastly temper, too, and was a brutal father to their only son, Pat, who remembered beatings with razor straps when Alfred wasn\u2019t occupied with beating his wife. That Alfred hardly bothered with other conjugal offices was probably a relief. In any case, Blanche\u2019s roster of lovers was almost as impressive as her publishing list, though in the first case she favored musicians: Leopold Stokowski, Jascha Heifetz, Benno Moiseiwitsch and Serge Koussevitzky, to name a few. \u201cMarriage is a useful institution for society, especially where there are children,\u201d she told a socialist newspaper, the New York Call. \u201cBut other than caring together for their offspring, marital partners should be free to go their own way.\u201d And so they did, keeping separate homes in Manhattan (Blanche) and Purchase, N.Y. (Alfred), where Pat chose to live more and more with his abusive father, who lured the growing boy with a furtive supply of prostitutes. One likes to think that this had something to do with his remorse over the razor straps, but Ms. Claridge suggests\u2014correctly, I think\u2014that it was mostly to spite Blanche.\n\nIf all this sounds like a dishy read, well, that\u2019s the idea. \u201cShe ripped through the Roaring Twenties,\u201d Ms. Claridge writes in her introduction, \u201cpartying with friends like the Fitzgeralds and Sinclair Lewis. . . . She maneuvered through World War II by flying into, not away from, battle.\u201d There was a certain amount of partying and maneuvering, I guess, but in fact one doesn\u2019t see much of the Fitzgeralds or Lewis after that first reference (and, from what I hear, partying with Sinclair Lewis wasn\u2019t that much fun), and the book has a kind of stolid quality, for all its emphasis on the lurid. Part of the reason, I think, is an almost total reliance on the research of others: In the \u201970s, Susan Sheehan began working on a book about the Knopfs but decided to put it aside, whereupon the Newsweek critic Peter Prescott took over and plugged away for some 20 years, until he died in 2004 and his wife turned his research over to the Harry Ransom Center in Texas. To be sure, Ms. Claridge brings her own perspective to these materials (Blanche good, Alfred bad), but when she stitches all the limbs together and throws the switch, the creature lurches around and topples over.\n\nI wondered especially why Blanche herself should seem so vague to me\u2014an amorphous lump of neediness and energetic competence. Take those lovers of hers: When the conductor Koussevitzky dies, Ms. Claridge speculates that Blanche \u201cmust have been nostalgic for their shared past.\u201d It may be so, but we know almost nothing about the affair\u2014her most passionate by far, the author assures us\u2014except that it happened, and hence we feel little in the way of nostalgia ourselves. What did these two talk about? At first I figured that Ms. Claridge had been forbidden by the Knopf estate to quote letters, but apparently not: On page 193, for instance, there\u2019s a long if rather inconsequential quote from Blanche to Freud, and 50 pages later the author gives another longish quote compounded mostly of logistical details and a smiley face at the end: \u201cI have a plane out of Guyana to London 3 August which I will postpone a couple of days if I can,\u201d Blanche informs her husband. \u201cI fly to Zurich on the 26th and if I don\u2019t go to Milan I\u2019ll go to Geneva,\u201d etc.\n\nWhy these quotes? Why? Did Blanche never write anything of intimacy or substance? And why quote at any length an obvious form letter from Gen. Eisenhower (\u201cwho was supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe\u201d) in response to some recent Knopf titles that Blanche had cordially sent him? \u201cYour selection includes books which will be invaluable to our staff, drawn from ten nations,\u201d Ike or his amanuensis replies, though he or she might have been bemused by a selection that \u201cprobably\u201d included a 1951 reprint of Ford Madox Ford\u2019s elliptical Modernist classic \u201cThe Good Soldier,\u201d or so Ms. Claridge surmises, given its militaristic title perhaps.\n\nWhat one gleans from all this is that Blanche persevered, and good for her, but at what price? Much is made of her anorexia, both pro and con: The author quotes her \u201cadoring butler\u201d observing that his mistress\u2019s thinness (her ideal weight was around 75 pounds) made her look \u201cvery sexy . . . like Goldie Hawn,\u201d whereas Knopf editor Stanley Kauffmann thought she resembled \u201can expensively attired starveling.\u201d As for Alfred, it gave him yet another pretext for cruelty, as he would exploit her lack of body fat by refusing to throw logs on the fire until she positively begged, whereupon he would oblige her and put on a bathing suit. In the end, though, it\u2019s safe to say that Blanche managed to step a little out of this ogre\u2019s shadow. How do we know? Reader, if you have tears, prepare to shed them now. \u201cThis is very sad news for a lot of us,\u201d Eric Sevareid telegraphed, we are told, on hearing of her demise. \u201cIt makes me realize again how much Blanche did for me and so many writing friends of mine.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mr. Bailey is working on a biography of Philip Roth.",

Minnery tried to follow the money trail, even crisscrossing the country looking for records.\"The director looked at me and said 'Why do you care about this stuff?' It took me aback, you know? My supervisor asking me why I care about doing a good job,\" said Minnery.He was reassigned and says officials then covered up the problem by just writing it off.\"They have to cover it up,\" he said. \"That's where the corruption comes in.

Make way for new ones. What happens when they get the address wrong and knock down your home instead? Tonight abc's jim avila on the fight playing out right now should these home wreckers have to pay up? You'd be surprised. New dining room will have -- Reporter: It was supposed to be the retirement home of their dreams. Soon to be empty-nesters david and valerie underwood had a grand plan, to fix up this ft. Worth house and move in. It had been david's grandmother's, a gathering place for family holidays, filled with cherished memories. That was our first third-generation christmas. Reporter: Then last summer, after hiring architects and builders, the underwoods drove by to check out the condition of their lawn. I've got mowing, weeding to do. But -- Reporter: Then a shocking discovery. Something was missing. Right about here she taps me and goes, \"david, the house is gone.\" Reporter: It's totally gone. It's totally gone. It's totally gone. It was surreal. Reporter: That's right. The lakeside view was intact. But the 1,200-square-foot home gone. Where are we kind of standing? This was the garage, and the living room was right over. The bedrooms were back on that edge of the house. That was the patio. Reporter: How on earth could a house just vanish into thin air? Believe it or not, the city had bulldozed it by mistake. They even took pictures of their handiwork. I was just shocked, like you know, what in the world? Like, how do you tear down the wrong house? Reporter: The underwoods' house is 9716, clearly marked on their mailbox. The right house, the one the city was supposed to demolish, was next door at 9708. But somehow the brain trust at city hall managed to mess that up. And in today's world of gps, when you can spot something the size of a nickel, I would think that -- you can. -- That there would be a fail-safe. Reporter: A onetime occurrence? Actually no, according to real estate mogul barbara corcoran. It happens more than you think. You could probably find at least one home wrecked in just about every city across the united states by mistake. Reporter: Demolishing the wrong house is actually hard to do, according to new jersey contractor lou santora. It's basically just completing a mountain of paperwork. Letters from your asbestos compan the gas company, the water company. If you're a competent contractor things like this shouldn't happen. Reporter: That's small comfort to andre hall. He figured he had the wrong address when he saw a backhoe tearing down a house. I was like, \"oh, somebody's house is getting knocked down. It can't be mine.\" I drove around the block and came back, and it was my house. I was just in shock. Reporter: He had poured his heart and soul into fixing up the pittsburgh house, prepping it so his three daughters could move from living with their mom out of state to be with him. I put new glass, put new frames, new windows. I did everything I had to do to get this house right. Reporter: He even painted his daughters rooms. There's no place like home. And now for hall, that's way too true, because there's no home period. It's gone now. It ain't nothing but an open lot. Reporter: Hall hit rock bottom. Today he lives in an apartment without his daughters. Nobody wants to take the blame. The contctor points the finger at the city. The city points the finger at the contractor. Reporter: You'd think when your house gets bulldozed by mistake you'd get compensated, and quickly, but you'd be wrong. Jessie vernon is a good example. Here are pictures of his little rock house being demolished last year. The city-hired contractor admitted to a local tv station that he made a big bulldozer blunder. There were two houses side by side, and I didn't look close enough to figure out which is which. Reporter: But adding insult to injury, vernon has not been paid neither by city nor by the contractor. And listen to this bold reasoning from the contractor's attorney. They say they did vernon a favor. I think mr. Vernon actually benefited from what my client did. And I'll be glad -- Reporter: He knocked down the house and benefited from it? That can be made to sound terrible, and normally I assume it would be. Reporter: Well, if it was your house, you would think it was terrible. Surely. Surely. But the city had told mr. Vernon months before this to either get a permit to fix this house up or to demolish it. My client just hastened what was probably inevitable. Reporter: But that's not your client's decision to make. He can't undo it. You can't unring the bell at this point. Reporter: But vernon says he was planning to repair the house to rent it out. Vernon went to a city council meeting to try to get justice. Good evening, I'm jessie vernon. Reporter: No luck. Mr. Vernon's and the city's interests are not aligned. Reporter: File that under legal talk for \"sorry, chump.\" We had to ask a few questions. Is it really not your fault? You have no responsibility for this? The people you hired knocked down the wrong house. Yeah. The people we hired didn't do what we hired them to do. No, I don't think that we have a legal responsibility for that. Reporter: So if I hired somebody to knock down my porch, and they knocked down my neighbor's porch, don't you think my neighbor's going to come after me, not just the guy who knocked down the porch? Well, I think so. But you don't have immunity from negligence actions, as local governdo. Reporter: Wait, come again? You don't have immunity from negligence actions, as local governments do. Reporter: You heard right. Some local governments are off the hook from lawsuits. So if they hire a bungling backhoe that happens to flatten your home sweet home you're on your own. Where does that leave vernon? The city advised him to sue the errant contractor. It would cost me money to sue. And I shouldn't have to pay a dime. All I've heard is talk. Reporter: Back in ft. Worth, talk is all david underwood has been hearing, too, even though the city admitted they made the error. In a statement to \"20/20,\" they said they have -- \"reviewed city policies and procedures and added a series of additional checks.\" But they still haven't paid a check to underwood. You must be a little ticked off by now, right? Well, frustration's growing. Reporter: Especially since for the years that the city was collecting taxes on the house, before it was demolished, it was appraised for $82,000. But now that the city might have to pay for the wrecked house there's a new appraisal for just 25 grand. You can't buy a car for that, much less a house, right? Exactly. Reporter: We wanted to ask the city about that, and since they wouldn't talk to us on camera we went straight to city hall to confront underwood's councilman. Hi, I'm jim avila. From abc news 20/20. Nice to meet you. Are you disappointed at all that the city has not come forward when they admitted they made the mistake? We are going to settle with this gentleman, but there has been some discourse over total settlement value, and that's where it's at right now. Reporter: But has the assessment been reduced in order to pay him, pay him a lower amount? I can't answer that. No, absolutely not. Reporter: The underwoods still hope they can salvage their dream house, rebuild. But the memories they had, those have been demolished. And so what is left of your dream at this point? Uh -- it's a new dream. It's a new vision. It's a -- yeah. We're going to have to build a totally new house now. There's not going to be that tie to my childhood. It did mean something to me, obviously. If I'd want it torn down, I'd have torn it down. A lot of fingers pointed in this one. Who should pay? The contractor or the town that hired them?

        "text": "It\u2019s back-to-school season, so it\u2019s worth asking which top universities offer their female students the best springboard to a powerful position at the top of their own company?\n\nOver the past five years, 40 women with undergraduate degrees from Stanford University have received venture capital funding for companies they founded, more than any other top school, according to data from Pitchbook, which provides research to private equity and venture capital firms. Among the companies founded by Stanford alums receiving venture capital funding in recent years is flash-sale style home decor website One Kings Lane, which was founded by Stanford grad Susan Feldman along with Alison Pincus, the wife of Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus. Another Stanford grad, Clara Shih \u2014 a former Fortune \u201c40 Under 40\u2033 member who also serves on Starbucks\u2019 board \u2014 co-founded social media marketing management service Hearsay Social with former Microsoft engineer Steve Garrity.\n\nWhen it comes to MBA programs, Harvard tops the list with 56 female founders receiving funding over the past five years. Companies springing up recently that are led by female Harvard MBA\u2019s include beauty and grooming products delivery service Birchbox, founded by Harvard MBAs Hayley Barna and Katia Beauchamp, which recently raised $60 million in a Series B funding. Another company on the list is personal styling for women website Stitch Fix, which was founded in 2011 by Katrina Lake, who actually has degrees from both Stanford and Harvard.\n\nHarvard also came in third on the list of undergraduate programs with 29 female-founder alums dating back to 2009, finishing behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its 31 female founders during that same period. MIT finished third on Pitchbook\u2019s list of MBA programs with female alums receiving VC funding over the past five years. MIT had 23 during that period, behind Stanford\u2019s 31.\n\nOf course, those three schools aren\u2019t just churning out female entrepreneurs. Stanford, Harvard and MIT also placed in the top five (for both undergraduates and MBAs) in a separate Pitchbook list ranking schools by the number of company founders of all genders that they produced. That the schools fared well on both lists \u2014 again, Stanford topped the undergraduate list, while Harvard\u2019s MBA program topped its list \u2014 shows that these top schools are simply consistently producing successfully entrepreneurial graduates of all genders.\n\n\u201cA lot of the undergraduates [at these schools] have been heavily focusing on computer science and engineering, especially in the past decade or so. It makes sense, since those schools are producing those types of degree holders, that both male and female graduates would be the ones creating these products and companies,\u201d said Andy White, a Pitchbook analyst.\n\nHowever, even the top schools on the Pitchbook list are seeing a large disparity between the number of female founders they graduate and the total number of company founders spawned by each school. For instance, Stanford may lead the way with 40 female founders over the past five years, but that group accounts for less than 11% of the total number (378) of Stanford alums to receive VC funding for their companies in that period. Similarly, female founders account for only about 16% of the 352 total company founders with Harvard MBAs from that same time period.\n\nWhite says he expects the gap between female and male company founders to narrow over time, though, and he even points to a Pitchbook study from last year showing that companies with at least one female founder have increased their share of VC funding rounds in each of the previous 10 years. Those numbers showed female-founded companies more than tripled their share of U.S. venture rounds during that time, rising to 13% last year.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot more money flowing into those companies founded by women and I can only see that increasing,\u201d White said.",

He's a former two-division champion as a professional. But all anyone wants to talk about with \"JuanMa\" is how entertaining he is in the ring. One of his bouts hasn't gone to a decision since 2009 -- a pretty ridiculous feat considering the competition level he has faced.\n\nIn all, Lopez, 31, has only gone the distance three times in his nine-year pro career. Of his 34 wins, 31 have come by way of knockout. But Lopez is concerned that's all he'll be remembered for.\n\n\"When I retire, I want people to talk about how good I was, not just how exciting I was,\" Lopez told FOX Sports.\n\nIt's for that reason you might see a more conservative \"JuanMa\" against Jesus Cuellar on Thursday night at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas (FOX Sports 1, 9:30 p.m. ET) -- at least as conservative as Lopez can possibly get. He is coming off a loss to Fernando Vargas in July and admitted to contemplating retirement. When this co-main event fight came up, though, it was too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\n\"This is very, very important,\" Lopez (34-4) said. \"Probably the most important of my career. I can't afford a loss. This fight here gets me into the bigger fights down the road.\"\n\nCuellar (24-1) will come in as the favorite. He's the reigning interim WBA featherweight champion and, at 27, four years younger. In the narrative, he's the young, hungry lion trying to make his name off the more well-known boxer. It's combat sports booking 101.\n\n\"I know that this is going to be a hard fight,\" said Cuellar, an Argentinean. \"I've been training hard for it in an intense camp and I'm here to do my job and take the victory home.\"\n\nLopez has other plans. He knows with the way the sport works, he can notch just one or two wins and get right back into more marquee fights.\n\n\"Boxing is like that,\" Lopez said. \"The landscape is always changing. It's constantly changing in boxing. I know a victory here is a step in the right direction. A huge fight.\"\n\n\"JuanMa,\" though, admitted to thinking about retirement after the loss to Vargas. He has been through an incredible amount of wars. But he said he's reinvigorated by the prospect of fighting Cuellar. Lopez's body feels good and he's excited about the possibility of getting back on track.\n\n\"JuanMa\" might be known for his unabashedly crowd-pleasing style, but that's secondary Thursday night. His career -- his legacy -- comes first.\n\n\"Forget about looking good,\" he said. \"I need to win.\"",

I am an enthusiastic private collector, mainly of mid-20th-century British art; it has been one of the great joys of the past 10 years for me. But in the end, Discerning Eye needed a bit of crumpet, however old, and I suspect more people will come to see my facelift than anything else. In past years the panel has included Brian Sewell, Lord Palumbo, Lord Gowrie and the Prince of Wales.\n\nWe six selectors met on a cold, wet day last September. We were positioned behind two trestle tables in a grim basement and asked what tickled our fancies. The works, a staggering 2,400 of them, were presented to us by half a dozen quite dazzling young men, all artists themselves.\n\nThe bonus of male beauty apart, much of the art was a joy and quite often two or three of us would be trying to bag the same picture. Mark mainly wanted what I wanted. It was quite comforting to find Peter Randall-Page and Norbert Lynton wanted the same as me. And I almost never wanted anything that Mark wanted. When Mark absented himself for a couple of hours to do an interview, I helpfully chose a photograph of a fish on a women's backside on his behalf. Sadly, he was having none of it when he returned. So the lady and the trout do not appear in his list.\n\nThe exhibition opens tomorrow at the Mall Galleries in London (020-7930 6844), and of the 500 works of art on display, my collection is the largest. I've made a selection of 90, mostly by young artists. I've got a couple of installation pieces that are fantastically eclectic, by really interesting young graduates. One of my favourites is a portrait of James Lloyd by Brendan Kelly. And I've discovered Matthew Webber, who is wonderful.\n\nTwo things struck me: first, what a vast amount of unsung talent there is out there; and second, to this trader's daughter, how sweetly uncommercial the youngsters were. \"Call it Notting Hill,\" I urged one of the young artists with an untitled work, \"it will walk out the door in seconds.\" I want to insist that anyone going to art college must attend a three-month marketing course, preferably taught by me. It is all about getting your work known, circulated and hung.",

And I\u2019m hardly alone. In short, we seem to have reached peak unicorn.\n\nIn response, many have shrugged and said something like, \u201cEven if all of these companies were to completely fail, it wouldn\u2019t really have a broad economic impact. The amount of venture capital invested each year is tiny compared to the public markets, and just half of the amount of VC invested in the dot-com boom.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not predicting that all of these companies will fail, or anything close to it. Instead, I think the next step will be a series of so-called \u201cdown rounds,\u201d or at least structured debt financings that don\u2019t officially affect equity values. Plus a bit more M&A activity.\n\nBut it\u2019s also not appropriate to brush off potential unicorn struggles as something that would only affect a small group of wealthy investors.\n\nWhen valuations begin to contract, so can company growth, particularly when it comes to hiring. Growth\u2014even in something as seemingly random as valuations\u2014begets growth. If capital availability tightens, it can lead to layoffs.\n\nIn response to a request from Fortune, research firm PitchBook reports that 91 U.S.-based unicorn companies employ around 57,000 people.

The Bible: Exodus is a story of ethical and political redemption.\n\nThe Film: Hebrew slaves are freed, but racial controversy surrounding the film clouded the story\u2019s overall message of liberation. Scott selected white characters as Egyptians and Hebrews in the film.

It is unclear whether he represents God or a figment of Moses\u2019 imagination or an angel or something else. Moses is not sent to Pharaoh by God, but goes on his own. The drama in the film is inter-human, between Moses and Pharaoh than between God and Pharaoh.\n\n3. The Bible: Moses flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave.\n\nThe Film: Moses is kicked out of Egypt when Pharaoh realizes Moses is a Hebrew. Moses does appear to kill an Egyptian soldier, but that was in retaliation for the soldier calling Moses a slave. It was not Moses defending an oppressed brother or sister.\n\n4. The Bible: The Pharaoh is unnamed.\n\nThe Film: The setting is the reign of Ramses. Hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves are portrayed in the movie, but the actual population of all slaves and of Hebrew slaves is unknown. Scott appears to try to bring the historical setting of the time to life, but the reality is that the \u201chistorical\u201d Exodus story is hard to pin down. \u201cThere is a deliberate lack of specification [in the Bible],\u201d explains Ellen Davis, professor of Bible and practical theology at Duke Divinity School. \u201cPharaoh is the sort of quintessential oppressive ruler in the Bible, and that is how he is remembered in later literature, so he stands for the oppressor of the moment in a sense.\u201d",

        "text": "This piece originally appeared on STATnews.com.\n\nA boy in Pakistan became a local legend as a street performer in recent years by traversing hot coals and lancing his arms with knives without so much as a wince. A thousand miles away, in China, lived a family wracked by excruciating bouts of inexplicable pain, passed down generation after generation.\n\nScientists eventually determined what the boy and the family had in common: mutations in a gene that functions like an on-off switch for agony. Now, a bevy of biotech companies, including Genentech and Biogen biib , are staking big money on the idea that they can develop drugs that toggle that switch to relieve pain without the risk of addiction.\n\nThe gene in question is SCN9A, which is responsible for producing a pain-related protein called Nav1.7. In patients who feel nothing, SCN9A is pretty much broken. In those who feel searing random pain, the gene is cranking out far too much Nav1.7.\n\nThat discovery raises an obvious question: Can blocking Nav1.7 provide relief for many types of pain \u2014 and someday, perhaps, replace dangerous opioid therapies?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the dream,\u201d said David Hackos, a senior scientist at Genentech, which has two Nav1.7 treatments in the first stage of clinical development.\n\nIt\u2019s too early make any sweeping predictions \u2014 and, indeed, a Pfizer pill targeting Nav1.7 has already stumbled \u2014 but the pharma industry clearly sees the potential for a blockbuster.\n\nFor more on Health and Technology, watch this video:\n\nLast year, Biogen paid $200 million for a firm called Convergence Pharmaceuticals to get its hands on some Nav1.7 inhibitors. Amgen amgn is in the early stages with a similar project. And Purdue Pharma, the controversial maker of opioid therapy OxyContin, launched a joint venture last year specifically focused on Nav1.7 drugs.\n\nEach is betting that this novel approach to pain relief could upend the standard of care for chronic aches, which are now often treated with weak anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or with opioids, which bring serious side effects and the potential for abuse.\n\nOpioid prescriptions have more than quadrupled since 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioid abuse kills about 30,000 Americans each year, according to the agency, and about half of those deaths result from prescribed therapies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous need for innovative, effective, and safe treatment modalities,\u201d said Dr. Jianguo Cheng, vice president of scientific affairs at the American Academy of Pain Medicine. \u201cIf it\u2019s truly effective, it could be revolutionary.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s early days yet for Nav1.7, and investigators have much to prove before anyone can pencil in billion-dollar sales.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of how good the target is, it\u2019s going to be tough sailing,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Waxman, a professor of neurology at Yale Medical School and West Haven Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nSide effects, for instance, will need to be closely scrutinized, Waxman said. The pain-free patients born with faulty SCN9A genes are otherwise pretty much normal, but no one really knows what will happen to healthy patients when their Nav1.7 is blocked. Only a sizable clinical trial can determine for sure, Waxman said.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s hard to know when pain drugs are working. Many fields of drug development rely on biomarkers, measurable reactions that tell researchers whether their efforts are having an effect. In chronic pain, no such standards exist, Waxman said, forcing scientists to use less reliable measures like patient surveys.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of placebo effect. High among the major impediments to developing new pain treatments is the sudden, baffling rise in sugar pill efficacy. Last year, researchers in Canada surveyed pain trials over 23 years and discovered that while active drugs performed pretty much the same, placebos grew more and more effective.\n\nAnd the Nav1.7 field already has at least one clinical disappointment on the books.\n\nA pill tested by Pfizer did well in patients with inherited erythromelalgia, the genetic condition found in the Chinese family, but had little effect on dental pain. A later study testing the same pill on nerve pain related to diabetes was similarly disappointing, and Pfizer quietly shelved the effort last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating area,\u201d said Douglas Krafte, who worked on the program. \u201cThe science has been so fascinating, and the drug discovery has been challenging.\u201d\n\nKrafte, who is now the chief scientist at the pharma contractor Icagen, believes there\u2019s plenty reason to be optimistic that Nav1.7 will pan out. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right way to approach it.\n\n\u201cThis is just part of the process of making a new kind of pain drug,\u201d said Genentech\u2019s Hackos. \u201cIt\u2019s one that may take years, but we\u2019re making a lot of progress.\u201d",

        "text": "The Chicago teachers strike has put Democrats in a difficult position. Teacher unions are the most powerful constituency in the Democratic Party, but their interests are ever more clearly at odds with taxpayers and inner-city families. Chicago is reviving scenes from the last crisis of liberalism in the 1970s, when municipal unions drove many American cities to disorder and bankruptcy. Where did their power come from?\n\nBefore the 1950s, government-employee unions were almost inconceivable. When the Boston police unionized and went on strike in 1919, the ensuing chaos\u2014rioting and looting\u2014crippled the public-union idea. Massachusetts Gov. Calvin Coolidge became a national hero by breaking the strike, issuing the dictum: \"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.\" President Woodrow Wilson called the strike \"an intolerable crime against civilization.\"\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt also rejected government unionism. He told the head of the Federation of Federal Employees in 1937 that collective bargaining \"cannot be transplanted into the public service. The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer\" because \"the employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws.\"\n\nFDR pointed out the obvious, that the government is sovereign. If an organization can compel the government to do something, then that organization will be the real sovereign. Thus the National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act of 1935 gave private-sector unions the power to compel employers to bargain, but the act excluded government workers. It declared that federal and state and local governments were not \"employers\" under its terms.\n\nPostwar prosperity and the great increase of public employment revived the public union idea. By 1970, nearly 20% of American workers worked for the government. (In 1900: 4%.) The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees led the effort to persuade a state to allow public-employee unionization, and Afscme prevailed in Wisconsin in 1958. New York City and other cities also permitted their workers to unionize.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy issued an executive order 50 years ago that broke the dam. The order did not permit federal employees to bargain over wages (these are still set by Congress), or to force workers to join a union or to strike (no state or city allowed that), but Kennedy's directive did lead to unionization of the federal workforce. And it gave great impetus to more liberal state and local laws. Government-union membership rose tenfold in the 1960s.\n\nThings soon got ugly. The Wagner Act had fomented labor militancy, notably sit-down strikes in 1937 that disrupted manufacturing and retarded the economy. But in the late 1960s and 1970s, federal and state union-promoting laws produced unprecedented strikes by teachers, garbage collectors, postal workers and others, even though every state prohibited strikes by public employees.\n\nAfscme began to arouse resentment from other union federations\u2014especially the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees International Union. Afscme's abrasive president, Jerry Wurf, became an easy target for his opponents. He was said to have advised Baltimore firefighters to \"let Baltimore burn\" if union demands were not met; Wurf was subsequently regarded as generally having a let-it-burn attitude.\n\nIn 1976 the Supreme Court derailed a movement to enact the National Public Employment Relations Law (\"a Wagner Act for public employees,\" as supporters described it) led by Rep. William Clay of Missouri. The court held that Congress could not apply federal labor laws to state employees. The justices stated the obvious, that \"the States as states stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation.\"\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, the budgetary burdens imposed by public unions had helped revive conservative movements, leading to the elections of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. Undeterred, William Clay told the Professional Air Traffic Controllers at Patco's 1980 convention to \"revise your political thinking. It should start with the premise that you have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests. It must be selfish and pragmatic.\" He told them to \"learn the rules of the game,\" which were \"that you don't put the interest of any other group ahead of your own. What's good for the federal employees must be interpreted as being good for the nation.\" The take-no-prisoners message helps explain why President Reagan fired and replaced the striking controllers, and why the public overwhelmingly supported him.\n\nHistorians tend to depict the Patco strike as a replay of the 1919 Boston police strike, with Reagan as the new Coolidge. But breaking the Patco strike had zero impact on public unionism. It may have cooled the willingness to strike, but unions continued to flourish. Public employment and government unionism have grown more than the population since 1980. The Patco replacements soon joined the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and carried on Patco's work.\n\nNor did the breaking of the strike \"send a signal\" to private employers to take a hard line against their unions, as some historians of the time have suggested. The factors responsible for private-union decline antedated the Patco strike and continued after it. Reagan ultimately may have even helped the public-employee union movement: By stoking the nation's economic revival in the 1980s, he made the costs of public unions begin to seem less onerous, and polls suggested that American worries about the matter declined.\n\nPublic unions do well in flush times like the 1950s and 1960s, but they suffer when taxpayers feel their true cost, as in the 1970s\u2014and today.\n\nMr. Moreno, a professor of history at Hillsdale College, is the author of \"The American State from the Civil War to the New Deal,\" forthcoming from Cambridge University Press.",

        "text": "After he resigned as Conservative leader in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith found a new purpose in his quest for social justice. That cause inspired him to co-found the Centre for Social Justice and brought him back to frontline politics, despite his bruising experience in the leader\u2019s chair. Ultimately, it also led him to resign from the government on Friday, as his frustration at what he saw as endless obstruction from the Treasury boiled over.\n\nAll former cabinet ministers find that the transition to the backbenches leaves them with spare time and energy. Some write books, some go on the speaking circuit and others commit it all to seeking a route back to the top table. Duncan Smith will presumably commit to the campaign to leave the European Union, a cause which has long been close to his heart. That\u2019s not to say he will stop talking about social reform and start talking about Brexit \u2013 rather, he has a unique opportunity to explain why a Leave vote would help Britain become a fairer society.\n\nThe early skirmishes of the referendum campaign have largely focused on either macro-policy, like international trade rules, or micro-frippery, like the views of the monarch. As the debate gets into full swing, both sides will need to explain how their preferred outcome will directly affect voters\u2019 day-to-day lives.\n\nWelfare and work are an essential part of that picture \u2013 and there is an as-yet-unheard case that both could be improved by voting to leave. Duncan Smith has long argued that constructing a fairer society requires money and the freedom to reform the welfare system. Leaving the EU would provide both. Ultimately, the referendum in June is about control \u2013 control of our laws, our public policy and our public spending. On each front, EU membership compromises Britain\u2019s ability to act freely and flexibly to address its social problems.\n\nThe government itself sought through the renegotiation to regain power over who can claim welfare in the UK. The two central requests were set out in the Conservative manifesto \u2013 that benefits should not be paid for those children whose parents work here but who do not themselves live in this country, and that new arrivals should work for four years before they become eligible to access the welfare system. These were modest and popular demands, endorsed in a general election, but the EU still rejected them, watering down each so heavily that the process more closely resembled policy homeopathy than a renegotiation.\n\nThat failure sent a clear message about the reality of EU membership \u2013 we have lost the right to define the rules of our own welfare state, and have thus lost the ability to manage its costs or focus its resources as we wish.\n\nWhatever your preference might be regarding the size and nature of the welfare system, it is hard to argue that the voters who fund it and use it should not have democratic control of its terms and scope. During the renegotiation, Duncan Smith identified the four-year waiting period before migrant workers could access benefits as \u201ccrucial\u201d, and with good reason. With a stubbornly large deficit, there is no unlimited source of money for the welfare state; therefore, the greater the number of people who have the right to claim benefits, the less money there can be for each recipient. If one argues, as he does, that a permanent improvement in the lives of those in the greatest need requires the allocation of sizeable up-front resources, then allowing unlimited access to in-work benefits for EU migrants reduces the opportunity to deliver a new life for those in the direst need.\n\nOne of the passages in the work and pensions secretary\u2019s resignation letter which will have caused the most pain in Downing Street will be the charge that the government\u2019s fiscal priorities are skewed \u2013 not least that they protect benefits for better-off pensioners while cutting from the young.\n\nThat argument, too, can extend to our EU membership \u2013 it is both absurd and unjust to pay such vast amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money to Brussels while battling to reduce spending on public services at home.\n\nAll the political agony and fury of the coalition years saw a total of \u00a317bn saved from the welfare budget. And yet last year our gross contribution to the EU exceeded \u00a319bn. Even if a post-Brexit government wanted to continue all EU spending \u2013 an unlikely circumstance given the wasteful way in which Brussels spends much of our money \u2013 that would leave a net saving of over \u00a310bn.\n\nDuncan Smith would be justified in arguing that it is more socially just to take money from well-paid Eurocrats than from British welfare recipients.\n\nMark Wallace is executive editor of ConservativeHome",

        "text": "As public spending cuts have an impact across European and North American countries, the debate over the value of overseas aid is reaching new levels of intensity, no more so than in the United Kingdom where the Coalition has pledged to ringfence and increase the aid budget to reach 0.7 per cent of its Gross National Income from 2013. The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan adds a new and urgent perspective, tragically showing how even a rich and developed nation can find itself in need of external humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe debate encourages us to think about the role of foreign aid in developing countries \u2013 its potential, its benefits, as well as its possible pitfalls. Is foreign aid affordable? Does the need for foreign aid outweigh domestic calls on public spending? Will it reduce poverty or instead be lost to corruption? Will it lead to a culture of dependency? These are critical questions for governments and the public they represent, and I would like to add my thoughts both from the perspective of President of Liberia and Goodwill Ambassador for Water and Sanitation in Africa.\n\nWhether you measure poverty by the one and a half billion people living on less than a pound a day, the one billion who go hungry each day, or other indicators such as the eight million children who die each year from preventable diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, poverty on the scale it exists today is an affront to our common humanity. It also carries a significance beyond national borders and is therefore of global importance. In an increasingly interlinked world, countries are more dependent on one another for their prosperity, security and safety, and to answer challenges such as climate change.\n\nI have seen, at first\u2013hand, how aid, effectively targeted and delivered, reduces poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa there have been major improvements in child health and in primary school enrolment over the last two decades. To choose one example, between 1999 and 2004, the continent achieved one of the largest reductions in measles\u2019 deaths ever seen. These positive results and outcomes would not have been possible without the support of donors such as the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), complementing the resources which low-income countries mobilize domestically. In my own country, Liberia, both humanitarian and development aid have helped us recover and rebuild from the devastation and trauma of civil war, improving the future for the millions directly involved and affected.\n\nThe British public is right to demand that their aid be corruption-free. It is the poor who bear the heaviest burden of corruption \u2013 it pushes them further into poverty, and deepens inequality and injustice. Corruption is a continual risk to progress, and combating it must be a joint endeavour pursued tirelessly by developed and developing countries. In Liberia, I declared a zero tolerance on corruption when I assumed office, and I continue to stand by this declaration. I believe passionately that all governments receiving aid have an enduring obligation to ensure that it is properly used. When they do so, and their anti-corruption efforts complement donor transparency and independent monitoring such as adopted by DFID, I have no doubt that aid can and does achieve its essential objectives.\n\nCitizens in both the North and South also have a right to demand that aid achieves value for money, and in this light I am pleased to see that DFID has identified increasing the number of people with access to clean water and sanitation as a top priority for Liberia as well as other African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi and Mozambique. There can be few more important and effective interventions, as diarrhoea, caused by lack of access to these basic human rights, is the biggest killer of children under five in Africa. With access to safe water and sanitation, lives are saved, health outcomes are improved, more children, especially girls, can go to school, and stability thrives. It is hardly surprising that the United Nations Development Programme estimates that for every \u00a31 invested in water and sanitation, \u00a38 is returned to the economy through increased productivity.\n\nThe UK has a long-sustained dedication to reducing poverty, inequality and inequity in the developing world, and for this the public should be proud. And whilst it can only be right in the current context that aid budgets in all donor countries undergo increased scrutiny, and that strong results and value for money are both demanded and expected, I believe it would be a fatal mistake for governments to adopt aid-sceptic or, worse still, anti-aid approaches.\n\nAid should, of course, never be an end in itself. Provided that it is delivered on the basis of being timely, temporary, and targeted, it can save lives and transform life chances in today\u2019s developing world, just as the Marshall Plan helped rebuild European economies after the long years of war, laying the platform for stability and prosperity. African entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim recently commented that the main objective of aid is to abolish the need for aid.

        "text": "There are two great themes running through this book. One is Jerry Lee\u2019s love-hate relationship with Elvis; the other is his struggle with the Devil.\n\nLewis arrived at Sun determined to topple Elvis from his throne as the king of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2013 and for a brief while he did. Shortly before departing for army service in Germany, Lewis claims, a tearful Presley bequeathed him his crown, saying, \u201cYou got it. Take it. Take the whole damn thing.\u201d\n\nWhile Elvis meekly allowed himself to be tamed and neutered by the egregious Colonel Tom Parker, Lewis \u2013 whom nobody ever described as \u201cmeek\u201d \u2013 remained the authentic article. In 1977, the day after Elvis died, Lewis was asked by a reporter what he felt on hearing the news. He replied: \u201cGlad. Just another one out of the way. I mean, Elvis this, Elvis that. All we hear is Elvis. What the s--- did Elvis ever do except take dope I couldn\u2019t get a hold of?\u201d He now explains that he was drunk, \u201cand hurting and angry\u201d. The truth is \u201cI loved Elvis\u201d. But not so much as to hand him back the crown. Pondering how they rank in the pantheon of music, Lewis remains unbowed: \u201cAfter me was Elvis.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019s upbringing was Pentecostal Christian \u2013 of the vengeful Jehovah rather than the gentle Jesus school. The fear of divine retribution did not, as Bragg delicately puts it, mean that he would grow up to adhere to the teachings, \u201cjust that he knew in his heart when he did wrong\u201d. Which was frequently.\n\nThe question that seems to have most tormented him, however, was whether you could play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and still go to heaven. When a troubled Lewis asked Elvis, who had come from an identical background, the question, Elvis's face, he claims, \u201cturned blood red\u201d and he snapped back: \u201cDon\u2019t you never ask me that again.\u201d\n\nIt behoves any writer contemplating the state of Lewis\u2019s soul to write in cadences pitched somewhere between southern-fried folk wisdom and the Book of Revelation \u2013 and Bragg rises manfully to the challenge. \u201cThe demons even outran the music, and he found he could not run fast enough to beat them and still hold the road,\u201d he writes.\n\nEven allowing for the fact that an authorised biography will err towards generosity, this book is hardly a character reference. Lewis emerges as cantankerous, boastful, threatening, possibly sociopathic. But Bragg remains ever-understanding.\n\nOne can well recognise, as Bragg puts it, that \u201cas a southern man\u201d, Lewis required guns \u201cin the same way other men require a pocket watch and suspenders\u201d; and shooting his bass player might well have been an accident. But still, one can\u2019t help thinking there was something decidedly careless in his handling of firearms. Having passed the time one night by shooting at random into a wall of his office, he awoke, hung-over, the next day to discover that the bullets had destroyed a display case of antique dentures in the dental practice next door. \u201cHe was relieved to find they were not actually in someone\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nHis greatest violence, however, was reserved for himself. Much of this book has all the appalling, rubbernecking fascination of a car crash \u2013 something with which Lewis, a man who \u201chad never seen anything wrong with going out and driving off a good drunk\u201d, was all too familiar. His drug consumption reads like a pharmaceutical manual: biphetamines, Placidyls, Desbutal.\n\nThe litany of tragedy is similarly stupefying. One son died in a swimming pool. So did his fourth wife. Another son died in a road accident. By way of consolation, the women (countless) \u201cwere always sympathetic with me\u201d. At the age of 47, he married a 25-year-old, Shawn Stephens, who two months later was found dead in her bed. An autopsy revealed the painkiller methadone in her system at 10 times the normal dose. A grand jury reviewed the case but could find no grounds for indictment. In 1984, doctors cut away a third of Lewis\u2019s stomach after he was diagnosed with perforated ulcers. In 1986, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, looking \u201clike a man who had walked through a fire and been put out just in time\u201d.\n\nMiraculously, in 2008, he returned to the Top 30 with an album featuring guest artists including Keith Richards, B B King and Bruce Springsteen. At the age of 79, having finally kicked his addiction to pills and whatever else, \u201cThe Killer\u201d now passes much of his time in repose, lying in bed at his ranch, with his guns on the dressing table and an ill-tempered chihuahua named Topaz Junior on the quilt between his feet.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story by Rick Bragg\n\n512pp, Canongate, Telegraph offer price: \u00a317 (PLUS \u00a31.95 p&p) (RRP \u00a320, ebook \u00a38.54) .

        "text": "\"I used to think I was this made man,\" says entrepreneur Glenn Kelman. \"That's what they tell you after you take a company public.\"\n\nIn 1996 Mr. Kelman co-founded Plumtree, a business-software firm that went public in 2002. After that, he assumed that his next idea was as good as paid for.\n\n\"Whatever I thought of, they'd fund it,\" he says.\n\nThen, in 2006, Mr. Kelman became chief executive of a real-estate startup, Redfin Corp.\n\nRedfin sounds like it would be catnip for technology investors. The company aims to overhaul how people buy and sell houses, using software and data to improve real-estate agents' customer service. Real estate is an opaque, expensive insider's game\u2014exactly the kind of business that is ripe for getting blown up by a less-expensive, more-convenient Web-powered service.\n\n\"We wanted to change the whole thing in the consumers' favor,\" Mr. Kelman says, his voice straining with a revolutionary's passion. \"We wanted you to have an agent who was on your side, who used technology the whole way through the process and who charged half the price.\"\n\nBut whenever Mr. Kelman shopped his plan in Silicon Valley, venture capitalists looked at him funny. He raised millions of dollars, but the money came fitfully, often at lower valuations than he expected.\n\nEventually Mr. Kelman realized the problem. Like Soylent Green, Redfin is made of people\u2014sales staff and customer-service representatives.\n\nTo tech investors, companies that depend on such people are old-fashioned. People are unpredictable and hard to manage. They are costly to hire and train, and their path to success is difficult to set into an algorithm. People don't scale.\n\nYet Redfin is one of a handful of startups showing that people can make a big difference. Mr. Kelman believes that improving the real-estate business takes more than just better code. It takes better people, specifically, better real-estate agents. Consequently, Redfin has hired hundreds of agents on staff, people to whom it pays salaries, benefits and on whose work the company depends.\n\nAfter years of slow growth, Redfin is poised to hit it big. It's on track to book $100 million in revenue\u2014and turn a profit\u2014next year.\n\nAnd its path suggests that businesses that try to improve workers\u2014and not just code\u2014can be better for customers and, in the long run, better for the bottom line.\n\nLike Zillow Inc. and Trulia Inc., Redfin is partly a website that helps you find houses for sale. But unlike those companies, which make money through ads placed by traditional brokers, Redfin is a full-service brokerage. After you find your dream house on its site, Redfin makes money when you sign up with one of its agents to guide you through the home-buying process. (Its agents sell houses, too.)\n\nMr. Kelman says Redfin's unusual setup offers several advantages over traditional brokerages.\n\nFirst, it improves service. If you're touring a neighborhood and see a house for sale, you can order up a Redfin agent to drive over to show you the property quickly. In the company's most-established markets, Seattle, for instance, the agent can be at your service within an hour. (It takes longer in Redfin's newer markets, like Dallas). This works thanks to a blend of technology and management. Just as the Uber online ride service maps its drivers, Redfin keeps track of its agents' calendars and real-time locations. Unlike a traditional real-estate brokerage\u2014in which agents essentially are contractors of a brand, not employees\u2014Redfin's agents are salaried workers. The company can tell them where to go and what to do.\n\nRedfin helps soothe other home-buying frustrations as well. Redfin compiles detailed histories on competing brokerages' pricing strategies, strengthening Redfin agents' negotiating prowess. Redfin also conducts most of the home-buying process online, reducing paperwork. And if you're selling your house, Redfin can test offer prices on the Web, helping you to home in on the optimal price.\n\nThe biggest opportunity is price. Mr. Kelman says the incentives of traditional real-estate agents are misaligned with those of customers. If you're selling your house, your agent, who gets paid on commission, will prefer that you take a lowball offer over no offer. If you're buying, your agent will want you to bid higher than you might otherwise want\u2014or need\u2014to pay. Economists call this the Principal-Agent Problem, and it has proved stubbornly intractable in real estate.\n\nMr. Kelman says Redfin has a solution. About half a typical Redfin agent's pay comes through salary. The rest comes through commissions. But crucially, commissions are linked to detailed reviews that Redfin customers complete after sales. The reviews are posted online and affect each agent's future business. Your agent always has an incentive to please you. If pushing a client to close a deal will produce a bad review, the agent would rather not close.\n\nRedfin is still tiny. In its most-established locations, it has about 3% or 4% of the market. In bigger, newer markets, it seems nearly nonexistent.\n\nMr. Kelman concedes that his people-dependent model has slowed Redfin's growth. But he sees the prospect of long-term returns. \"After we hit a certain threshold in the market, our share begins to accelerate,\" he says. In other words, over time, better service begins to pay off.\n\nRedfin last month said it raised $50 million from T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Tiger Global Management LLC. Compared with tech-focused venture capitalists, Mr. Kelman says, these investors didn't care that Redfin might take several more years to realize its mission of revolutionizing real estate. They were willing to wait, he says.\n\n\"Most of Silicon Valley isn't that patient.\"\n\nWrite to Farhad Manjoo at farhad.manjoo@wsj.com",

That means the end of ski season is near\u2014perfect timing for a little reflection on how technology has become front-and-center in the skiing experience.\n\nIt\u2019s been a spectacular winter for Lake Tahoe. After several years of drought, El Nino blessed California with the most snow it has had since 2012. But pristine powder isn\u2019t the only new thing on the slopes this year. Increasingly, mobile apps and social features are table stakes for Tahoe resorts, letting skiers track their vertical feet and purchase those annoying photos someone\u2019s always taking of you at the top of the mountain. As I discovered on a recent reporting expedition to Lake Tahoe (I swear, it was for work), even the way the mountains are groomed and artificial snow is made has changed. Just as you would expect, much of the process is now automated, controlled remotely by\u2014you guessed it\u2014mobile devices.\n\nA lot of the noticeable innovations on the slopes are about consumer-facing mobile features (and, of course, drones\u2014more on that in a bit). Vail Resorts, which owns the likes of Tahoe\u2019s Northstar and Heavenly, has had a chief information officer for years. It now employs a growing team of mobile apps developers. The company launched its EpicMix ski app about six years ago, but added features like social sharing in recent years. (One new addition that has yet to make it to Tahoe: a tool that shows wait times at different lifts.)\n\nBack when I first learned to ski, a frighteningly long time ago, the coolest \u201ctech\u201d on the mountain was the gondola. But it wasn\u2019t all that frighteningly long ago that cell phone reception was still spotty at the top of the mountain. Now, places like Vail-owned resorts are giving skiers more reasons to pull out their phones on the slopes\u2014not just to take selfies. The company says EpicMix now has about 700,000 users.\n\nThen there is the small matter of drones. At nearby Squaw Valley (not owned by Vail), skiers can pay $99 to have a drone film them making their way down the mountain. In order to make this dream-you-didn\u2019t-know-you-had come true, the resort partnered with a company called Cape Productions. \u201cWe are competing with lots of other opportunities for how people spend money on their leisure time,\u201d says Louis Gresham, one of the skiers-turned-techies who started Cape.\n\nAt this point, drones are a tiny business for ski resorts (Gresham says that in addition to sharing revenue with the resorts, Cape gives them access to the footage they shoot). But I\u2019m willing to bet that, like it or not, they will have a growing presence on the slopes. That is, of course, if the damn weather doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\nOne drawback to all those winter storms we\u2019ve been getting here in the California mountains: High winds and heavy precipitation make it very hard for drones to fly. Even in the age of software, Mother Nature still rules.",

        "text": "Sam Brinton says that his father first tried physical abuse to rid his young son of homosexual feelings. When that didn\u2019t work, Brinton\u2019s parents turned to something called reparative therapy.\n\nSome of the memories are hazy more than 10 years later, but Brinton does remember the tactics the counselor used. There was talk therapy, about how God disapproved, and there was aversion therapy, during which pictures of men touching men would be accompanied by the application of heat or ice. \u201cIt was pretty much mental torture,\u201d Brinton says. \u201cTo this day, I still have light pain when I shake hands with another male.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade after leading medical organizations abandoned the idea that homosexuality was something that could be cured or corrected, the concept of conversion therapy remains a particularly charged issue for LGBT advocates. Two states outlaw the practice and legislation is pending in another. But not all the momentum is against reparative therapy. Earlier this month the Texas Republican Party voted to include support for the practice in their party platform. Now a group of advocates and lawmakers are launching a new effort to ban licensed counselors from trying to change a minor\u2019s sexual orientation through therapy of any kind.\n\nOn June 24, the National Center for Lesbian Rights will announce the beginning of a campaign called #BornPerfect, an educational and legislative push to \u201cmake clear that every LGBT person is born perfect,\u201d says executive director Kate Kendell. \u201cIt is now generally understood that sexual orientation cannot and should not be changed and that efforts to change it are damaging.\u201d She believes that the time is right for the campaign, as LGBT people have become more accepted in society and medical establishments have come out against what is also called conversion therapy.\n\nOn June 16, the New York State assembly voted 86 to 28 to pass a reparative-therapy ban, and though Governor Andrew Cuomo expressed support for the bill, lawmakers in the GOP-controlled state senate blocked the measure from coming to the floor for a full vote. Had the senate passed the bill, New York would have become the third state, after California and New Jersey, to put such a law on the books.\n\nOpponents like Liberty Counsel, a legal organization affiliated with Liberty University, were also ready to file a lawsuit, much like those the organization filed against the California and New Jersey laws.\n\nDaniel Schmid, Liberty Counsel\u2019s lead litigator, says that bans on reparative therapy potentially violate the freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights of those who would perform or seek it. \u201cIf you allow [counselors] to talk about sexual orientation to minors, you can\u2019t allow only one viewpoint to be presented,\u201d he says. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against that argument in California last August, instead siding with the logic that such a law amounts to professional regulation, a condition for providing state counseling licenses. Schmid and his clients, including therapists and families, have appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nHomosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a diagnostic bible published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), in 1973. In 1998, the APA released a statement saying the organization \u201copposes any psychiatric treatment, such as \u2018reparative\u2019 or \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder, or based upon a prior assumption that the patient should change his/her homosexual orientation.\u201d Schmid argues that the statement is based more on politics than documentation of harm caused by such therapy.\n\nThe #BornPerfect campaign will aim to dissuade parents who might be considering reparative therapy by providing them access to psychological experts and those who have been through such treatment, like Brinton. \u201cWe have no doubt they love their children,\u201d Kendell says, noting that many parents might believe LGBT people lead more difficult lives and wish to spare their children from hardship. \u201cWe want parents to understand there are resources for them to come to terms with embracing their child as they are,\u201d she says, whether those are online or public forums. The campaign will also include ongoing legislative efforts in other states to pass reparative-therapy bans, though Kendell declined to say which will be next at this time for fear it would mobilize the movement\u2019s opponents.\n\nThough conversion therapy is largely associated with sexual orientation, the #BornPerfect campaign will also aim to prevent therapy that is aimed at changing a child\u2019s gender identity, in the cases that a child does not identify with the gender that corresponds with the sex that was assigned at birth. \u201cTo the extent that this is a budding practice,\u201d Kendell says, \u201cwe want to nip it.\u201d\n\nOne well-known reparative therapist is Joseph Nicolosi, based in Encino, Calif. A banner at the top of his website says, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have to Be Gay,\u201d with bullet points that advertise the ability to \u201cDiminish your unwanted homosexuality\u201d and \u201cDevelop your heterosexual potential.\u201d Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, which has also worked to oppose the reparative-therapy bans, argues that sexual orientation is \u201cfluid well into adulthood\u201d and can be influenced by factors such as a domineering mother or history of sexual abuse. \u201cA truly tolerant nation is one that respects the rights of all Americans,\u201d he says, \u201cnot just those who happen to be the political majority of a legislature.\u201d\n\nAfter a year and a half in therapy, and multiple suicide attempts, Brinton finally lied and promised to have been cured of homosexual thoughts. \u201cIt kept me in the closet for so many years,\u201d Brinton says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of internalized shame. And it\u2019s all related to just this nagging trauma of something\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

Sign up here.\n\nAs tough as the industry-wide transition to cloud computing has been for PC-era software companies, it has been even tougher for data center hardware suppliers.\n\nJust ask IBM ibm , which has recorded revenue declines for its last 15 quarters. Or EMC emc , which is looking for salvation in Dell\u2019s arms. But the darkest storm clouds are starting to lift, at least for hardware companies who have retooled their equipment for the cloud era. Sometime during the past 12 months, it appears many businesses swapped the question, \u201cShould I move my IT operations to the cloud?\u201d for this one \u201cWhen is the best time for our cloud transition?\u201d\n\nUnder the cloud computing model, applications and other IT resources are delivered via pools of servers, storage devices, and networking gear over which businesses may have very little management control. Slowly but surely, organizations of all sizes are opting to use these services for a larger portion of their IT operations.\n\nThat means, of course, that fewer companies are buying servers and other gear for their own data centers. Instead, more are opting to rent from the likes of Amazon amzn Web Services, Microsoft msft , and Google goog (the \u201cBig Three\u201d of cloud computing). The latest evidence lies in purchasing patterns reported last week by market research firm IDC.\n\nLast year, spending on hardware meant for big clouds increased 22% to almost $29 billion. Indeed, almost one-third of the fourth-quarter equipment revenue attributable to tech giants Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe , Dell, Cisco csco , EMC, and IBM was generated by hardware intended for cloud installations. We can expect more of the same this year: IDC projects spending on cloud-related computing hardware will top $38 billion, continuing to grow by double digits for at least the next several years. By 2020, spending on infrastructure for \u201cpublic\u201d cloud services\u2014those shared among businesses rather than dedicated to serving a single company\u2014will reach $37.5 billion.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of this transition has been Cisco, which sells equipment converging features of servers and networking gear. Revenue for that portion of its product portfolio grew almost 36% during the fourth quarter to $802 million, reports IDC.\n\nOf course, the hardware manufacturers are by no means out of the woods. Many of the biggest cloud service providers\u2014including Facebook fb and Amazon\u2014are opting to build their build their own gear to keep costs down while personalizing their design needs.

Measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, the quake mainly affected the town of Mashiki on the outskirts of Kumamoto city.\n\nThe real devastation, however, came around 48 hours later, when the same region was struck by a far more powerful, magnitude 7.3 quake. At least 33 others were killed in the second quake, which left close to 200,000 displaced and thousands of homes without electricity or running water.\n\nThe same day as the second temblor, around 9,000 miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Ecuador was hit with an earthquake that far exceeded the destruction seen in Japan. Even as the death toll from the 7.8-magnitude quake rose to almost 600, the South American nation was rocked by several aftershocks \u2014 including one on Wednesday that measured 6.1.\n\nDespite the timing of the two disasters and their presence in the earthquake-prone zone known as the Ring of Fire, seismologists say a connection between them is unlikely and not necessarily indicative of a larger trend.\n\n\u201cWe do know that large earthquakes cluster,\u201d says Gary Gibson, a seismologist and professor at the University of Melbourne, adding that the most recent cluster \u2014 including a 6.9-magnitude tremor felt in Burma (Myanmar) last week that caused minimum damage \u2014 has been particularly active.\n\n\u201cThe last two or three weeks have been exceptional, there is no question about that,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cBut in terms of worrying about whether it means an even bigger one somewhere else, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nWu Pak-cheuk, who heads the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, tells TIME that a correlation between the two sets of earthquakes is highly unlikely, because they \u201care a little too far away, and not on the same [tectonic] plate.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, both countries were also hit with different types of quakes, with the two that hit Japan likely resulting from something called a strike-slip, that occurs along faults situated at a relatively shallow level. The Ecuador earthquake, on the other hand, occurred because of a process known as subduction \u2014 where one tectonic plate slides under another to create what is known as a \u201cmegathrust\u201d event.\n\nA geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey tells CNN, however, that research into a phenomenon called \u201cremote triggering\u201d \u2014 where an earthquake in one part of the world can cause another some distance away \u2014 is still ongoing.",

        "text": "A few years back, I used to tell people I was a comedian (if they asked, that is, not apropos of nothing). I decided to stop doing that when a good friend\u2019s teenage brother observed with earnest confusion, having spent 10 minutes talking to me, that I couldn\u2019t be a comedian, since I\u2019m not funny. These days, I say I\u2019m a writer. As well as finding the incident personally crushing, the brother\u2019s damning verdict made me realise something about the way people tend to think about what \u201cbeing funny\u201d is, and how it ought to manifest itself. To this logical lad, and many others, people are funny in the same way as they are \"tall\" or \"Japanese\" \u2013 it\u2019s an ever-present, empirically obvious part of their nature.\n\nThe reason I write all this is not simply to win an argument with my friend\u2019s younger brother, but to make a wider point about comedy, especially in literature. I\u2019ve recently been writing a stage adaptation of a Dostoevsky short story called The Crocodile, which is funny in ways that are playful and profound and pretty politically punchy. In the process of writing it, I\u2019ve come to learn that many people don\u2019t think of Dostoevsky as funny at all, and the assertion that he can be hilarious tends to meet with, at best, suspicion and, at worst, polite indulgence. Which is quite annoying for me, and, I imagine, had he the means of eavesdropping, maddening for him.\n\nLike my friend\u2019s brother, readers seem to have no problem declaring that a writer is or isn\u2019t funny without really justifying themselves or providing a list of the stuff that makes them laugh for us to assess their relative expertise or trustworthiness. Of all the areas of literature, humour has the strange privilege of being by far the most personal in appreciation and the most objective in judgment. Imagine if we talked about writers being \u201cmoving\u201d or \u201cinsightful\u201d in the same cack-handed way as we talk about them being \u201cfunny\u201d. I doubt that readers and critics would declare with the same confidence that \u201cDostoevsky isn\u2019t moving\u201d or that \u201cKafka isn\u2019t insightful\u201d as they might brazenly offer up a sentence like \u201cBeckett isn\u2019t funny\u201d. Which, by the way, he is. Sometimes.\n\n\u2022 100 funny jokes by 100 comedians\n\nAnyone who spends any time on the internet, especially among the lynch mobs who operate underneath every YouTube comedy clip, will be aware that the often innocent act of someone trying to be funny can make people murderously cross with each other. There are semi-religious wars raging online between fanatics who know in their heart what funny feels like, and make self-righteous pronouncements that crumble instantly under the weight of the most basic analysis. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t funny\u201d or \u201cGermans aren\u2019t funny\u201d, for example, are sentences that have the power to offend only because of the wilfully unsophisticated way we think about what \u201cbeing funny\u201d means. To say \u201cwomen aren\u2019t moving\u201d or \u201cGermans aren\u2019t wet\u201d wouldn\u2019t even make enough sense to be offensive. It would just be weird.\n\nThe Inbetweeners star Simon Bird will be perfroming in Basden's The Crocodile (Photo: Film4)\n\nIronically, the bloody-minded zeal that reduces all conversations about humour to people yelling \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d at each other is the very thing I find funniest in Dostoevsky\u2019s writing. Pomposity is one of the few growth industries in the age of the internet, and Dostoevsky\u2019s characters in stories like The Crocodile, The Gambler and Notes From the Underground are brilliantly observed, furiously funny forebears of the self-important online troll. I won\u2019t try to convince you of his comic genius here by quoting sentences out of context, because the only things that work well in isolation are one-liners, which, to be fair to the guy, are in short supply. Besides, trying to explain what\u2019s funny about something is the surest way to kill it.\n\n\u2022 Trying is the first step towards failure: 30 great one-liners\n\nPerversely perhaps, it\u2019s the humourlessness of Dostoevsky\u2019s characters, such as the truculent Alexei Ivanovich and the passionately progressive Ivan Matveeitch, that makes them so funny (to me, anyway), and renders their puny battles with society so laughable. Even if his writing doesn\u2019t tickle you, spending time with some of Dostoevsky\u2019s spiteful solipsists will at the very least provide an unnerving insight into how we all sound when mouthing off to anyone who\u2019ll listen about why some comedy is frankly unacceptable or unfunny. As the hero in Dostoevsky\u2019s The Dream of a Ridiculous Man complains to the world, capturing the angry sadness of the morally certain, and the daily difficulty we all experience when talking to people who disagree with us on matters of taste: \u201cOh, how hard it is when you\u2019re the only one who knows the truth!\u201d\n\nThe Crocodile is at the Manchester International Festival until July 18",

        "text": "The United Nations is selecting a new Secretary General this fall. TIME foreign affairs columnist Ian Bremmer spoke with Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, about how she would change the UN:\n\nWhat is the single most important thing that a UN Secretary General can do to make the United Nations a more effective institution?\n\nDeepen the trust among Member States, and between Member States and the UN as an institution. The UN is tasked with many responsibilities, including engaging in active preventive diplomacy, running outstanding field operations, creating the context for ambitious multilateral achievements, and delivering on programs across the many focus areas that have been mandated by governments. None of these can be delivered without trust. In the lead up to the Paris Agreement, we used to say that our three priorities were trust, trust and trust. This is because as deeper trust was established and carefully built, new types of conversations became possible and the elusive common ground began to emerge and grow. My vision is of a United Nations that Member States and citizens everywhere fully trust to help the international community avoid war, to excel at seeding and keeping peace where it is needed, and to foster breakthrough agreements and partnerships that improve people\u2019s lives today and give them greater hope for the future.\n\nWhat aspect of the UN\u2019s work do you believe is in greatest need of reform?\n\nLast year, the UN supported Member States to reach three breakthrough multilateral agreements that, taken together, lead us towards a more secure and prosperous future for all. These have become known as \u201cAgenda 2030\u201d. As a consequence of its own success, the UN as an institution now needs to reorganize around the inspiring goals that these agreements established, and ensure that it has the resources and capacity to ensure they are delivered. Many suggestions have been made about the specific reforms that might be needed \u2013 for example, the appointment of a Deputy Secretary General who is exclusively focused on Sustainable Development, or the establishment of a Sustainable Development Board to oversee the UN\u2019s 27 development programs, funds and specialized agencies; ensuring that they all pull in the same direction. An early task for the next Secretary General will be to consider the merits of these suggestions and come to a view about what\u2019s needed. But what\u2019s clear is that, with the negotiating phase now behind us, the UN must step confidently forward into this new era, pull together much more closely and gear up for the on-the-ground delivery of Agenda 2030.\n\nYou\u2019ve written of the need for greater UN investment in \u201cearly-warning\u201d of potential conflicts. What are the most important tell-tale signs of impending violence, and how can the UN use these to prevent conflict?\n\nThere are many factors that are linked to the likelihood of conflict: demographic shifts, exposure to fluctuating global commodity prices, economic performance and levels of inequality, a State\u2019s human rights record, security of access to vital resources, and communities\u2019 vulnerability to natural shocks like drought \u2013 to name but a few. The ongoing build up of adverse factors \u2013 to use the analogy of fire \u2013 is like the build up of large stocks of biomass. While lightning will not necessarily strike this year or next, still the build up of that biomass creates an ever-present risk; just one spark can, at any moment, tip the whole situation into conflict. Early warning systems are there to monitor the overall build up of that biomass; it does not help us to track some tell-tale signs, but not others. Rather, the UN system, working very closely with regional organisations, must continually scan and analyze the full range of data available; always on the look-out for the build up of risk.\n\nThere are several ways in which the UN can use this information to prevent conflict. In the short term, the UN can engage in preventative diplomacy; supporting States to alleviate and de-escalate key risk factors, where it notes that these are building up. For example, where particular communities are facing increasing water insecurity, the UN might support the host country and its neighbors to reach a trans-boundary water sharing agreements that ensures people\u2019s immediate needs are met. In the longer term, there is much that the UN can do to prevent conflict too \u2013 for example, accompanying countries in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda to ensure that societies everywhere are more prosperous, resource secure and resilient to shocks.\n\nWhat is the most important obstacle to the effectiveness of the Security Council, and what you do to overcome this obstacle?\n\nThe Security Council is at its most effective when its 15 Members share a common perspective on an emerging situation and can rapidly agree on what they see as the necessary course of action. But as we all know, it is rarely that simple. Given the complexity of many of the threats to peace and security that we see playing out today, and the different worldviews that come together on the Council \u2013 is it any wonder that a consensus position often takes time to emerge? This is not to excuse inaction \u2013 we are all shamed by the suffering we see in our world today and must do more to ensure people everywhere are safe and that their human rights are being honored. It is easy to say that there is no simple, quick solution to improving the effectiveness of the Security Council \u2013 but there are things that the Secretary-General can do. I would work tirelessly to ensure that many issues never need come before the Security Council \u2013 raising emerging threats early and lending my good offices to resolve a dispute before it becomes a conflict. Should this fail, I would not hesitate to bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in my opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. While the Security Council deliberated on the matter and what must be done, I would act as a trusted, impartial go-between for the various members, listening to their perspectives and giving 100% to building bridges between them in service of a swift and effective response.\n\nNo institution can be all things to all people. What things do you believe the UN should avoid trying to do?\n\nI believe the UN needs to act as a locus for agreement and as a catalyst for action; creating a favourable context for agreement among Member States, and mobilising a wide range of actors to deliver those agreements. While the UN system can and must align itself to help them deliver, it should not bear the full weight of delivery alone. The private sector, investors, civil society and many other stakeholders are very able to play their part; often having better access to capital flows and delivery infrastructure, including supply chains, than the UN. This approach is what I refer to as the new \u201ccollaborative diplomacy\u201d; inviting the contribution of others and blending the best of governmental and non-government \u2013 recognizing that more can be achieved through the collaboration of all.\n\nWhat specifically would you do as Secretary-General to help women and girls around the world to achieve their human potential?\n\nWomen\u2019s rights would be a key focus of my work as SG, and I would make this an overarching issue for all UN bodies to give special attention to. There have been some areas of improvement in women\u2019s rights globally in recent years, but overall progress has been limited, and significant inequalities and injustices based on gender persist globally. This is both unforgivable and a loss for all of us (not just women), as we all miss out when over 50% of the human population is not supported to achieve its full potential. Evidence shows, for example, that improving gender equality in all sectors can contribute to greater global peace and prosperity. There are many things that I would seek to do on this issue as SG. Firstly, I would strengthen the foundations upon which women\u2019s potential can flourish by promoting wider and stronger adherence to the UN Declaration on Human Rights and by implementing the 2030 Agenda \u2013 many aspects of which are relevant to women in particular. And secondly, I would make a concerted push on particular issues, including: providing greater aid to displaced women across the world (the vast majority of refugees and displaced people are women) \u2013 and putting additional safeguards in place to prevent them from being abused, and involving women in political negotiations and peacekeeping efforts.",

He describes himself, using expletives, as \u201ca 260-pound black guy with a don\u2019t-mess-with-me face.\u201d\n\nHe is also a Juggalo.\n\nThis week, Mr. Perkins, 31, known to friends as Less Legs, and thousands of other Juggalos and Juggalettes have made the pilgrimage to Thornville, Ohio, to take part in the 17th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos. The nicknames, claimed by fans of the rap duo Insane Clown Posse, come from the group\u2019s 1992 track \u201cThe Juggla.\u201d\n\nAfter arriving, many of the Juggalos paint their faces with heavy clown makeup, indulge in drugs and alcohol, attend concerts of Insane Clown Posse acolytes and hop on amusement park rides. The retreat started at 7 a.m. on Wednesday and will end Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a psycho-porn theme park,\u201d says Camille Dodero, a journalist who attended four consecutive gatherings starting in 2010 and is attending this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an intense sensory overload.\u201d\n\nThe number 17 holds an important place in the iconography of Insane Clown Posse, which has elevated the significance of this year\u2019s event. But news outlets and online gawkers have been gobbling up the spectacle for years, especially since since the release of \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d a short, lewd independent documentary from 2011 that captured the scene before much of the mainstream came calling.\n\n\u201cI saw that movie a hundred times,\u201d Mr. Perkins said. \u201cI showed my friends that movie to enlighten them on Juggalos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d introduced many people to the humans behind the movement for the first time.\n\nThe documentary also helped to defang the image of the Juggalos, described by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in February 2011 as a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d but now widely regarded as a tribe of mostly harmless outcasts.\n\nThe director of \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d Sean Dunne, 35, a filmmaker who grew up in the suburbs of New York City, said that he was inspired to make the movie in 2010 after Tila Tequila, a Myspace celebrity who performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos that year, was pelted with rocks and beer bottles before being chased from the stage to her trailer.\n\n\u201cI remember sitting around and thinking that there was no way they could be that bad,\u201d Mr. Dunne said of the Juggalos. \u201cAnd I went to the gathering, and they really weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Dunne\u2019s film barely mentions Insane Clown Posse itself. It ignores the concerts and carnival events of the gathering. Instead, it features more than a dozen interviews with Juggalos enjoying each other\u2019s company, many of them ingesting drugs or alcohol, and several of them at least partly nude.\n\nThe documentary also features a Juggalette nicknamed Maniac who claims to be sober, though Mr. Dunne clarifies: \u201cJuggalo sober is a little different from what we would think of as sober.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuggalo sober is like, you only had 10 beers, smoked some weed and did a little molly,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr. Dunne\u2019s film shows Juggalos at their most hedonic, it is often a sympathetic portrayal, showing his interview subjects to be friendly, tolerant and inclusive. In \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d the festival resembles what it is often promoted as by its attendees: an enormous family reunion.\n\nSince it was posted to the video-sharing service Vimeo in September 2011, \u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d has been viewed more than 2 million times. Sam Morrill, a lead curator for the website, called the documentary \u201cone of the most provocative and celebrated films\u201d on Vimeo.\n\nNot all Juggalos appreciate the film\u2019s influence. Jason Shaltz, a photographer who has been a fan of Insane Clown posse since the mid-90s, will celebrate his 36th birthday at the Gathering of the Juggalos on Thursday. He said that while he admires Mr. Dunne\u2019s talent, \u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d chose to turn the cameras away from Insane Clown Posse and the other musical artists at the festival, the central element that draws the Juggalos together every year.\n\n\u201cI think it catapulted into the public eye because of the freak show aspect of it,\u201d Mr. Shaltz said. \u201cPeople like to watch train wrecks.\u201d\n\nMr. Perkins, who moonlights as a rapper himself, disagrees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the story \u2014 we make up the community,\u201d he said of the Juggalos. \u201cI know people who go to the gathering that are deaf. That are blind.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the year after the film was released, the media presence at the event, as well as the percentage of non-Juggalos in attendance, increased. Several outlets made films similar to Mr. Dunne\u2019s and many others featured articles and slide shows that took a mocking tone toward the group.\n\n\u201cOnce the Gathering of the Juggalos wasn\u2019t something to fear, people started going as an extreme adventure,\u201d Ms. Dodero said.\n\nOnce the general public catches wind of a music festival, the event is often lamented as having changed for the worse. This summer, The Times\u2019s music critics said that they would not cover the more mainstream events Coachella and Bonnaroo, writing that many festivals \u201clook increasingly alike in their vision of a codified, consensual, safe and purchasable bohemia.\u201d\n\nBut the Gathering of the Juggalos has remained outside the mainstream, fans say, and has not changed with the influx of tourists looking for a thrill. If anything, attendees say, the Juggalos have a way of converting the newcomers.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like it when jerky hipsters come in,\u201d Ms. Dodero said. \u201cBut even then, I\u2019ve seen the biggest jerky hipster be transformed within 12 hours, saying, \u2018These are the best people ever.\u2019\u201d",

He met Monday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nMr. Steinmeier said both Russia and Ukraine should step back from a looming confrontation along their de facto border on the Crimean peninsula, where Russia said two of its soldiers died in a skirmish with a Ukrainian commando group that had slipped across. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014.\n\nThe foreign minister of Russia, Sergey V. Lavrov, talked about the country's intention to use diplomacy to reduce tensions with Ukraine.\n\nWhether any such skirmish took place remains a matter of dispute. Ukraine has denied it, and says the Kremlin invented the story to escalate tensions and to whip up nationalist passions before parliamentary elections next month.\n\nA Russian television report documenting the arrest of a couple of Ukrainian commandos included shots of a full moon at dusk, though the moon was waning on the date of the alleged incident. While that raised suspicions, the shot may have been stock footage, intended to convey a nighttime atmosphere in Crimea and not tied to the specific date of the episode.\n\nRussian security services have also released a video of a detained man, Yevgeny Panov, said to have led the raid. Olga Kovitidi, a Russian senator, emphasized in comments reported by the Russian news media that Mr. Panov is a driver at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the closest such facility to the war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts said the commentary was one of the first significant instances of Russia raising the prospect of instability affecting the nuclear industry in Ukraine, with dark echoes of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Ukraine operates four civilian power plants with 15 reactors, and several research institutes hold radioactive materials.\n\nDuring the meeting on Monday, Mr. Lavrov said Russia was ready to supply additional evidence proving the Ukrainian incursion into Crimea.\n\nOn Monday, Vedomosti, a Russian newspaper, reported that Moscow might respond by unleashing rebel forces in eastern Ukraine. The authorities, the report said, are considering \u201cceasing to hold back the actions of the army of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d the main Russian-backed rebel group, which has threatened to attack across the line of control in eastern Ukraine in response to shelling from government positions into populated areas.\n\nMr. Steinmeier pressed Mr. Lavrov to abide by the battered and now nearly two-year-old truce between Russian-backed rebels and the Ukrainian government, known as the Minsk agreement.\n\nStriking a conciliatory note, Mr. Lavrov said Russia intended to continue diplomatic relations with Ukraine in spite of earlier comments that they might be broken off over the skirmish in Crimea, but said a final decision rested with President Vladimir V. Putin.",

At the time, CCMP said that his departure was \u201chealth-related,\u201d but declined to provide any additional comment.\n\nLast Thursday, Murray died in his own home at the age of 52.\n\nWhat follows is something I\u2019ve been struggling with, but which I\u2019ve obviously decided to report. Namely because there is as much professional as personal in this situation, and that\u2019s my job (some may disagree, and that\u2019s understandable).\n\nMultiple sources now say that CCMP was tipped off in mid-December that Murray might have a serious substance abuse problem. It was not something that any of his partners had previously suspected, but a subsequent investigation led the firm, in January, to place Murray on a 60-day medical leave of absence. In written correspondence with limited partners, CCMP used the same \u201chealth-related\u201d terminology that it would use in February after determining that the separation with Murray needed to be made permanent.\n\nIt appears that CCMP was more forthcoming in response to verbal queries from certain LPs \u2014 including members of its LP advisory committee \u2014 but never in writing (likely for legal reasons).\n\nFor CCMP, this situation is about more than personal tragedy and professional embarrassment. Murray\u2019s departure triggered a key-man provision on a $3.6 billion fund that closed just last September.\n\nCCMP actually had multiple key-man clauses on the fund: Sole provisions for both Murray and then-chairman (now CEO) Greg Brenneman, and also for a certain majority of its investment committee. A rolling reinstatement process is now underway. I would imagine that it will pass (i.e., the firm will get to keep investing) \u2014 particularly given that the fund is already around 40% committed, and LPs committed to the broader team within the past year \u2014 but not all the votes are in yet.\n\nCCMP declined to comment for this story.",

I\u2019m 8 years old, and I\u2019m going to sing \u2018Anaconda\u2019 by Nicki Minaj.\u201d\n\nThat does not happen at a Kidz Bop Kids show, of course, but you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting such a jaw-dropping scenario. The Kidz Bop Kids are the public face and live-tour extension of Kidz Bop, the wildly successful album series on which youngsters sing today\u2019s top hits, often with family-friendly changes to the lyrics.\n\nThe company\u2019s tagline, \u201csung by kids for kids,\u201d is such a no-brainer. But it didn\u2019t take flight until Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam, cofounders of the label Razor & Tie, developed the idea in late 2000. The first volume of Kidz Bop, released the next year, was an immediate and massive success.\n\nSo much so that 14 years on, there are 28 volumes, most of which routinely crack the top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and kid album charts. That\u2019s in addition to various themed compilations such as country, Christmas, \u201csports jamz,\u201d and the Spanish-language Los Kidz Bop. Having sold more than 15 million albums, the franchise has become a juggernaut in children\u2019s music, a precursor to \u201cGlee\u201d and Disney shows such as \u201cHannah Montana\u201d and \u201cHigh School Musical.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in 2000 the owners of the company were going to a bunch of kids\u2019 birthday parties, and they found that the music was not where it needed to be,\u201d says Victor Zaraya, Razor & Tie\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer. \u201cThe analogy we used to use is that the range was from Britney [Spears] to Barney. There was nothing in between.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think kids like hearing other kids sing,\u201d Zaraya adds. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to discount that.\u201d\n\nThe company holds national casting calls and talent searches to find singers for the series. Grant Knoche, a 12-year-old from Texas, became a member of the traveling Kidz Bop Kids ensemble, which comes to the Wilbur Theatre on June 27, after a rigorous audition process that included a two-day boot camp full of singing, dancing, and interviews.\n\n\u201cWe have to listen to the original song before we record it, but they send us the lyrics,\u201d Knoche says from his home in Dallas, with his father, Sean, also on the line. \u201cWhen we\u2019re traveling and songs we\u2019ve done come on the radio, we\u2019re all singing along but then hear a different word. And we\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s not how it goes!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a comfort for parents to know they can listen to pop songs and keep up with what\u2019s cool, but they\u2019re kid-friendly versions. It\u2019s good clean fun,\u201d says his dad, who mentions he left his six-figure job to support his son\u2019s budding career. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the Mickey Mouse Club of our modern time.\u201d\n\nZaraya says the series has tremendous oversight of what is appropriate for its young listeners; the target demographic is ages 5-10. A team decides which songs are good contenders, and because Kidz Bop stays so current and usually releases at least two albums a year, sometimes it has to forecast what will become a hit.\n\nSpending an hour with the Kidz Bop catalog is an astonishing reminder of just how un-kid-friendly most of today\u2019s pop music is. Some songs, particularly ones dealing with explicit sexuality, are inherently not suitable. The aforementioned \u201cAnaconda\u201d comes to mind, and Zaraya says Robin Thicke\u2019s divisive \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d while a major hit, certainly never made the cut.\n\nEven the most innocuous lyric suddenly carries the weight of issues parents might not want to address with their children just yet. On the newest Kidz Bop, which debuted at No. 10 last month, their version of Taylor Swift\u2019s recent hit \u201cBlank Space\u201d swaps out a crucial line \u2013 \u201cGot a long list of ex-lovers/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m insane\u201d \u2013 with the more generic, \u201cGot a long list of some others/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m to blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\u201d from Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d gets a PG-13 makeover: \u201cWill your mouth still remember the look of my love?\u201d Whereas Bruno Mars exclaims on \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too hot/ Hot damn!\u201d the Kidz Bop Kids brag, \u201cI\u2019m too hot/ Hot yeah!\u201d\n\nThe series has its detractors. The iTunes reviews are especially damning \u2013 \u201cplease parents, do not ruin your child\u2019s ears by making them listen to this\u201d or \u201cHonestly, u should just buy the regular song\u201d \u2013 criticisms Kidz Bop has battled since day one.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who criticizes us, I\u2019d say it\u2019s for kids primarily. It\u2019s not for teenagers, who I think are the harshest critics,\u201d Zaraya counters. \u201cIf you put aside your thoughts on why it\u2019s not as cool as the original and just embrace having a good time with pop music, then I think there\u2019s a time and place for Kidz Bop. We\u2019re not just a trend.\u201d",

        "text": "When Time Warner announced in early March its plan to spin off the Time Inc. magazine unit by the end of 2013, financial analysts and the business press expressed broad agreement on the prospects for the two future entities. For the new Time Warner, the prevailing view was highly positive: The split is the next logical step in solidifying a pure-play television and motion picture colossus after the spinoffs of AOL and Time Warner Cable four years ago, and with CEO Jeff Bewkes shedding the drag of magazines and sharpening his focus on a stable of growing businesses, his record of enriching shareholders seems bound to keep rolling.\n\nFor a newly independent Time Inc., the 91-year-old publisher of Time, Sports Illustrated, People, and dozens of other titles, including Fortune, the general opinion was downbeat: Unlike Time Warner, which grew operating earnings in its nonpublishing businesses by 4.7% last year, the magazine business needs radical change. Put simply, revenues and profits for Time Inc. and the magazine industry as a whole are shrinking.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what strategy will reverse that decline. But industry experts and analysts agree that it might require daring bets \u2014 new digital platforms, alliances with tech-savvy partners, and even shrewd acquisitions. \u201cMagazines could have a strong digital model, better than most media companies,\u201d says Neil Begley, a fixed-income analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cBut for magazines to have a fighting chance, they will need financial flexibility, meaning the freedom to invest heavily to revive their businesses.\u201d\n\nTo get a dispassionate view of our parent company\u2019s prospects as a spinoff, we talked to Begley and other analysts, along with portfolio managers and investment bankers, for their views on how Time Warner should proceed. By and large, they endorsed Begley\u2019s view that Time Inc. would perform best with low leverage and the ability to be financially agile. It is certainly in the interest of Time Warner for the new Time Inc. to find favor with investors. The parent company\u2019s shareholders will receive stock in the new company \u2014 shares representing roughly 5%, or 1/20, of the value of a Time Warner share. Since Time Warner spun off AOL and Time Warner Cable in 2009, the stocks of those two companies have easily outperformed the broader market. And shares of Time Warner itself have nearly doubled.\n\nFor Time Inc., however, the path to revival could be blocked even before the spinoff happens. The crucial issue, analysts agree, is the amount of debt that Time Warner will place on Time Inc. If the magazine company is saddled with excessive leverage, it will lack what it needs to grow again: ample cash for big investments. It\u2019s tough to be innovative when your main concern is paying down debt. Diverting too much cash flow to debt payment could also stifle Time Inc.\u2019s ability to pay a dividend. Another factor is that Time Inc. must replace outgoing CEO Laura Lang. Attracting a star to the job will be a lot easier if the company isn\u2019t overleveraged.\n\nSo how much debt is the new Time Inc. likely to carry? The most common measure for leverage is the ratio of debt to Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization \u2014 essentially the cache of profits available for making interest payments. Time Inc.\u2019s Ebitda has been falling sharply since 2007. According to projections by Morgan Stanley, its Ebitda will reach $524 million by 2014, its first year as an independent company. That\u2019s a 15% drop from 2012.\n\nTime Warner hasn\u2019t given a specific number yet for what the debt load will be. Nor has it said whether it will pitch Time Inc. as a stock that pays a dividend at the outset. (Analysts believe that asking the fledgling company to pay a dividend and service debt could stunt its prospects.) On Wall Street predictions range widely, from $500 million to $2 billion. But an individual familiar with Time Warner\u2019s thinking told Fortune that the company \u201cplans to put on a level of leverage consistent with the ratios followed at Time Warner.\u201d Time Warner has a current debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 2.6, close to its stated goal of 2.5. Let\u2019s assume that Bewkes plans to base the spinoff company\u2019s ratio on Time Inc.\u2019s 2013 Ebitda of close to $600 million. In that scenario Time Inc.\u2019s debt would approach $1.5 billion.\n\nThe 2.5-times-Ebitda number may be right for Time Warner, but Begley and others think the ratio is excessive for Time Inc., which does not boast the same credit quality or diversified revenue sources as its parent. Consider that entertainment and publishing conglomerate News Corp. plans to shed its publishing assets this year \u2014 as the new News Corp. \u2014 with no debt.\n\nHere\u2019s how piling on excessive debt could choke off the new Time Inc.\u2019s investment capital. Afoccording to Begley, Time Inc. cannot afford to let its interest costs absorb a bigger and bigger share of its cash flow. To reassure investors, it should hold constant the cents in interest that it pays on each dollar of Ebitda. Ebitda has been shrinking at over 7% a year for five years, and most analysts expect the trend to continue. So Time Inc., from 2014 to 2018, would need to pay down an average of $95 million in principal on its $1.5 billion in borrowings to hold its interest payments constant at 19\u00a2, or 19% of Ebitda.\n\nThe crucial number is what\u2019s left over after Time Inc. pays its taxes and interest. That\u2019s the free cash that it can lavish on digital publishing technology or acquisitions. From 2014 to 2019 it would be forced to spend over a third of its cash flow on debt repayments, lowering the amount available for investments to around $180 million a year. But a bigger number would generate higher earnings and also make the company far safer in the eyes of lenders and shareholders.\n\nSo let\u2019s consider a second scenario: Time Warner structures the independent Time Inc. with a relatively light debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 1 to 1. That\u2019s the amount of leverage that Begley recommends. Based on its 2013 Ebitda, Time Inc. would then carry about $600 million in debt. To be prudent, it would still pay down principal each year to keep debt service at a constant portion of its Ebitda. But since both its interest and principal payments would be lower, Time Inc. would generate more cash each year.\n\nLayer on a second set of assumptions: Let\u2019s forecast that Time Inc. spins off with a 1-to-1 ratio and invests aggressively, and that those investments are successful. As a result, cash flows keep dropping in 2014 and 2015, then embark on modest growth of 3% a year through 2019. From then on, they simply rise with inflation at around 2%. In this projection, the cash flow available for investment would average about $320 million, almost 80% higher than under the $1.5 billion debt load scenario. The rising cash flows would create a virtuous cycle of ever lower debt and stable earnings.\n\nThat kind of turnaround will prove a tough challenge. But if Time Inc. can generate any kind of growth \u2014 and again, low leverage is key \u2014 its stock could actually be quite attractive to investors. Most analysts predict that after the spinoff Time Inc. will have an enterprise value \u2014 debt plus equity, minus cash \u2014 of around $4 billion. If that proves true and that the company takes on the more manageable $600 million debt load, Time Inc. will have an equity value of $3.8 billion. If Time Inc. can indeed restore growth by 2016, it could potentially boast a market cap of $6.3 billion by the end of 2019 \u2014 meaning annual returns of 9% for five years starting in 2014. That would be more than enough to turn a struggling magazine company into an unexpected Wall Street success story.\n\nThis story is from the April 08, 2013 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "A week ago, it seemed almost certain: The Federal Reserve would raise its key short-term interest rate next month after holding it near zero for close to seven years. Policy makers, over the past few months, had signaled as much as the US economy continued to grow steadily and the unemployment rate continued to fall.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s gyrations in global stock markets, largely tied to fears about China\u2019s slowing economy, the debate over whether the Fed should hike rates was renewed. Fed officials themselves seemed rattled and divided what to do.\n\nOn Monday, as stocks plunged around the world, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said he expected policy makers to stick to the tentative plan to raise rates in September. But a few days later, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, tried to reassure markets by saying the argument for raising rates had become \u201cless compelling.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee meet Sept. 16 and 17. Should they raise interest rates?\n\nThose who favor raising rates basically argue, \u201cEnough already.\u201d\n\nUnemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent and the US economy, according to the Commerce Department, grew at a healthy 3.7 percent pace in the second quarter. There\u2019s simply no need for the Fed to keep propping up the economy with such low rates.\n\n\u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t looking at reality,\u201d said Alex J. Pollock, a resident fellow specializing in financial affairs at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe rates should be raised.\u201d\n\nLike others who favor a Fed rate increase, Pollock said Fed policies \u2014 low interest rates and the earlier \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy by buying government and other securities \u2014 have created distortions in markets that have led to surging stock, bond, and real estate prices. Continuing easy money policies risks a new burst of inflation and creating the type of bubbles that led to the last recession.\n\n\u201cYou look around Boston and other cities, like New York and San Francisco, and you see the effects \u2014 all the commercial construction going on, being built with cheap money,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief executive and chief economist at Decision Economics Inc., a Boston consulting firm. \u201cUltimately, it leads to excesses and problems.\u201d\n\nSinai said he placed odds of a Fed rate hike at about 70 percent heading into last week. But he said it\u2019s \u201cnow a tossup\u201d what the Fed will do next month.\n\nBased on futures prices, investors see a 38 percent chance the Fed will move at the September meeting of the Open Market Committee and a 49 percent probability of a rate rise at the Oct. 27-28 meeting, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThose who oppose raising rates at this point say, yes, the US economy has improved, but it\u2019s still fragile and recent world events make it vulnerable to a possible slowdown \u2014 or worse. Wages are barely growing, they say, a sign that the labor market might not be as strong as the unemployment rate suggests.\n\nOpponents of a rate hike note that the Fed normally raises interest rates when it fears a sharp increase in inflation. But the inflation rate is now only running at about 0.3 percent a year, well below the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2 percent. Falling oil and commodity prices are easing price pressures further.\n\nInflation, they add, is so low that a shock that further weakens the economy could lead to deflation, the destructive cycle of falling prices and wages, and high unemployment. The Great Depression was an extreme example of deflation. More recently, Japan has struggled for the better part of the last two decades to break a cycle of deflation and anemic economic growth.\n\n\u201cInflation is simply not a threat right now,\u201d said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any pressing reasons why the Fed needs to raise rates now.\u201d\n\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Tufts University, said he worries that raising interest rates now might further strengthen the US dollar, making American-produced goods more expensive overseas and hurting export sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cThey should absolutely not raise rates,\u201d he said.",
        "generated": "The debate over raising interest rates is ongoing, as the US economy grows and unemployment falls.

        "text": "David Armstrong, who has died at age 60 from liver cancer, never achieved the kind of recognition afforded his best friend, Nan Goldin, but his influence was acknowledged of late by a younger generation of photographers, including Ryan McGinley. \u201cHe has a specific style and owns it,\u201d McGinley told the New York Times in 2011, when Armstrong\u2019s book, 615 Jefferson Avenue, was published. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Vermeer, using only sunlight to illuminate uni-directionally. His photographs are about desire and despair. These are qualities he looks for in the boys\u2019 eyes.\u201d\n\nThe boys in question were the male models that Armstrong had been photographing between 2001 and 2011, making the beautiful young men seem both timeless and out-of-time in his curiously classical and unapologetically romantic portraits. Armstrong had come to fashion photography relatively late, having been commissioned by the young designer Hedi Slimane to shoot backstage at a Dior catwalk show in 2001. Suddenly, in middle age, he was hip again and also ubiquitous, shooting editorials for the likes Vogue Homme and Purple magazine. It was an unexpected \u2013 and, one could say, unrepresentative \u2013 coda to a remarkable life lived, in the main, on the margins amid fellow freaks and outsiders.\n\nBorn in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1954, Armstrong befriended Nan Goldin when he was 14. He later said: \u201cAll the cool kids who met in the morning to eat hash brownies talked about this legend, Nan Goldin, who got kicked out of school the year before.\u201d He was the first person she photographed and they remained close throughout their teenage years and into their early twenties, both attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, where he studied painting before switching to photography. Alongside the likes of Jack Pierson, Philip-Lorca di Corcia and Mark Morrisroe, they became part of \u201cthe Boston School\u201d, unified by their shared approach to the making of arrestingly intimate images of their often dissolute everyday lives.\n\nIn Boston, and later in New York\u2019s Lower East Side, they both shot the same subjects \u2013 the drag queens and druggies that they hung out with. \u201cWe both delved in different ways with things available to us and didn\u2019t consider going outside our worlds,\u201d he told the New York Times.\n\nLike Goldin, Armstrong also became enmeshed in the hard drug culture he portrayed. His first boyfriend died of Aids in 1983 and, the following year, he went home to Boston to come off heroin. He stayed clean for 17 years, but began using again in 2002 describing himself wryly as \u201cfunctioning enough\u201d.\n\nIn 1994, Armstrong collaborated with Goldin on a photobook called A Double Life, which showed in their dramatically contrasting styles just how much their lives had intertwined. Armstrong\u2019s formally austere style and monochrome tones make his images seem, if anything more haunting than Goldin\u2019s. \u201cI used to think Nan and I were complete opposites and it was all about the complement,\u201d he noted at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from that. At the same time we\u2019re identical - like our pictures. At first they seem to come from different planets but finally they arrive at the same place.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Morel Books published Night and Day, a selection of Kodachromes from Armstrong\u2019s extensive New York archive from the late 1970s and early 1980s. A tale of drug-taking, partying and comedowns from an already long-lost time, it includes portraits of artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Di Corcia alongside shots of beautiful young people at play in the early hours.\n\n\u201cHe was such a cool cat \u2013 cultured in that old-school way,\u201d says Aron Morel, who got to know him over the past few years. \u201cHe reminded me a bit of Boris Mikhailov: two guys that worked because they loved it. Artists without the art market. The first time I met him, he sent me back to London with over 300 \u2018chromes\u2019 of the Night and Day series. Just like that \u2013 with complete trust. He was such a poetic guy. He had recently moved to a house in upstate New York and he said he was going to live his last days like Mrs Haversham in her mansion.\u201d Sadly, that was not to be.",

        "text": "For those of you just joining us at home, the other day shares of a company with the ticker symbol NEST soared 1,900 percent after Google announced the acquisition of Nest Labs. This was incredibly stupid because Nest Labs has nothing at all to do with NEST. It seems like a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSo the question Levine raised is whether trading in shares of NEST would be insider trading if you had advanced knowledge of the Google deal? Does the law prohibit you from using non-public information about a deal to profit off of people stupidly buying a different stock altogether?\n\nIn my earlier piece, I argued that insider trading law does say you can't do this. If you got the information because you were, say, a guy making deal toys for the people involved, you aren't allowed to take the information that you were entrusted with and that belongs to others, in this case Google and Nest, and use it to trade for yourself. And if you got the information from your buddy who was involved in the deal somehow, then you inherit his breach of fiduciary duty and so you're in trouble.\n\nNot so fast, says Levine. To give rise to insider trading liability, information must not only be non-public. It must also be \"material.\" And, to make a long Levine post short, since Nest Labs has no relationship to NEST, information about Nest Labs cannot be material to NEST.\n\nThat seems rather straight forward and smart. But it's wrong.\n\nHere's how the judge instructed the jury in the recent case against Mark Cuban:\n\n\"Materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information. Materiality is not judged in the abstract, but in light of the surrounding circumstances. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the information would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder.\"\n\nSo here's something both the federal courts and the SEC consider to be an important factor when considering materiality: The effect on the stock's price. As the Third Circuit put it in Oran v. Stafford, \"when a stock is traded in an efficient market, the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement, in the period immediately following disclosure, of the price of the firm's stock.\"\n\nThe price of NEST shares rose 1,900 percent when the deal was disclosed. That pretty much screams materiality.\n\nLevine says that the information isn't material because the connection just isn't \"reasonable.\" Or, rather, that no reasonable investor in NEST would care about the acquisition of Nest Labs. Sure the stock price moved, but that was unreasonable. And stupid. So it's not material.\n\nThe problem with this line of argument is that in Levine's scenario, the investor with inside information buys shares of NEST as part of a scheme to trade from a mistake he anticipates occurring when the deal is announced. And then that mistake happened. That may be stupid but it's not unreasonable\n\nLet's put it this way. Would knowledge of the Google deal have played a part in the decision of owners of NEST to sell their shares the day before the deal was announced? It may not have been decisive but surely it would have played some part. I mean, you own shares of worthless stock that could have value tomorrow based on investor error. Why not hold it an extra day?\n\nMore importantly, I think Levine is wrong about the touch point of materiality. He assume that the information needs to be material about the company in which the shares actually were traded. That's incorrect, in my opinion. Keep in mind that in a misappropriation case, the duty breached that gives rise to illegality is not owed to the person on the other side of the trade. It's owed to the person who is the source of the information. The line of materiality should also connect not to the investors in NEST but back to the investors in the source of the information, Google. And for Google investors, the multi-billion acquisition almost certainly was material.\n\nMisappropriation is about using the information that belongs to others for your own benefit, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality toward them. When judging materiality, it only makes sense that the correct place to look is to the owners of the information.",

Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express have \"zero liability\" policies, so you'll never lose a penny to credit card fraud.\n\n(Read more: 4 tips for avoiding holiday-related identity theft)\n\nWith debit cards, your maximum liability is $50, if you notify the bank within two days. After that it jumps to $500. You could lose all the money thatwas stolen from your checking account if you fail to report the fraud within 60 days of getting your bank statement.\n\nVisa and MasterCard promise \"zero liability\" on the debit card transactions they handle if the customer chooses to sign for the transaction rather than use a PIN. Even so, the missing money doesn't go back into your account instantaneously.\n\n\"Your money could be legally missing from your account for as much as two weeks while the bank investigates and decides whether to reimburse you,\" noted Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the advocacy group U.S. PIRG. \"During that time you may not be able to pay your rent or mortgage or buy anything with your debit card.\"\n\nSo why have a debit card? Some people don't qualify for a credit card. Others use them to stick to their budget, since you can't spend more than you have in your checking account.\n\n\"Debit cards are fine, right up to the point where they get stolen, and then they're no longer fine,\" Ulzheimer said. \"In my mind, if you qualify for a credit card and have the willpower not to run up a massive amount of credit card debt, then credit cards are a safer alternative.\"\n\nNote: After the Target breach, a few banks took the unprecedented step of limiting how much customers could spend at stores or withdraw from ATMs using their debit cards. No such restrictions were put on credit card customers.\n\n2. Free credit monitoring is nice, but it won't protect Target victims\n\nWe've come to expect free credit after a breach. It's a way for the company to show they care about us.\n\nCredit monitoring can be a useful fraud-fighting tool if someone steals your identifying information, such as date of birth, account passwords or Social Security numbers. That did not happen in this case.\n\n(Read more: Chart of the Day: Target's image takes a beating)\n\n\"To be honest with you, it's worthless in this situation,\" Pascual said. \"I think it created a false sense of security, which is unfair and probably wasn't the best way to go about helping people.\"\n\nThat's because the fraudulent use of your credit card does not trigger an alert on your credit report. And debit card transactions aren't even reported to the credit bureaus.\n\n3. A security freeze won't protect you in this sort of breach\n\nA lot of \"experts\" advised victims of the Target breach to put a security freeze on their credit report.\n\nWhen Social Security numbers are stolen, a credit freeze is the smart thing to do. It prevents an identity thief from opening new accounts in your name. But that did not happen in this case.\n\n\"A security freeze doesn't make any sense as a way to respond to this data breach,\" said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). \"That's something you typically do after you spot obvious signs of financial fraud.\"\n\nA freeze prevents lenders from accessing your credit report to process a new loan or credit card application. It does not prevent fraud on an existing account. It will not stop a crook from using a stolen account number to shop online or clone a new debit or credit card to use at the store.\n\nA credit freeze is a smart thing to do when Social Security numbers are stolen because it prevents a thief from opening new accounts in your name.\n\n4. Should you change the PIN number on your debit card?\n\nTarget confirmed Friday that encrypted PINs were stolen in the breach, though it said the \"key\" necessary to decrypt data is not within its system and could not have been taken during the breach.\n\nChanging your PIN will prevent a stolen debit card number from being used to withdraw cash at an ATM, but it won't stop a crook from using it to buy things. Debit cards can be used without a PIN at most stores.\n\nTo be completely safe, you'll need to ask the bank to issue you a new card number.\n\n5. Is it safer to choose \"credit\" over \"debit\" when you use a debit card?\n\nWhen you swipe your debit card, you're asked to choose \"debit\" or \"credit.\" I've heard it suggested that if you hit \"credit\" you are then making a credit card transaction. That's not true.\n\n\"There is nothing you can do to turn that debit card into a credit card, even if the card has the Visa or MasterCard logo on it,\" said Bill Hardekopf, CEO and founder of LowCards.com.\n\nWhat you are doing is choosing how that transaction is processed. Does it require a PIN or just a signature to pull that money out of your checking account?\n\n\"You're just as vulnerable to a hacker,\" said Brian Krebs, who broke the Target breach story on his KrebsOnSecurity blog. \"Nothing magically happens if you push credit instead of debit that makes it any harder for someone to steal your card information. It's all still ones and zeros on a magnetic strip.\"\n\nDebit cards are not going to go away. People like them. Banks encourage us to use them.\n\nConsumer groups want Congress to guarantee more fraud protection for debit cardholders.\n\n\"We would like to see the liability for debit cards capped at $50\u2014just like credit cards,\" said Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at the advocacy group Consumer Action. \"We'd like to see a higher standard of protection for debit cards enshrined in law, not just in the voluntary 'zero liability' programs offered by card issuers.\"\n\nThe nation's bankers oppose any change in the law. And quite frankly, it's unlikely Congress will do anything. That means you need to take steps to protect yourself.\n\nBest practices for anyone with a credit or debit card\n\nThe best way to take responsibility for your financial security is to go online a couple of times a month to check your credit card and checking account statement. Look for any unauthorized charges and report them right away. Don't wait for your end of the month statement.\n\nTake advantage of financial alerts, if available, on your accounts that can give you a heads-up to a possible problem.\n\n(Read more: Banks could sue over Target card data breach)\n\nIf you get a notification in the mail that your debit or credit card accounts have been breached, respond immediately, because the risk is real. Javelin's data show that people who were notified of a card breach this past year had a 28 percent chance of being the victim of card fraud.\n\nBeware of email alerts that ask you to provide your personal information. Target is not doing this, and no company would. These bogus alerts are from identity thieves.\n\n\"These attacks are affecting retailers of all sizes, and they are going to continue to happen,\" Pascual said. \"Consumers need to remain vigilant and take advantage of any opportunity they have to monitor their accounts and protect themselves.\"\n\n\u2014By CNBC contributor Herb Weisbaum.

It fuels the world\u2019s workforce, with more than 1.3bn cups consumed around the world every day according to coffee researchers Allegra Strategies.\n\nMore than 1.3bn cups are consumed around the world every day\n\nYet unlike wine sommeliers, the baristas making and serving your skinny, frothy, cappuccino or latte haven\u2019t always been taken seriously. Working in the coffee industry has been thought of as an in-between job, something you\u2019d do to get you through college or help bolster the sporadic income from an acting career. For decades, working in coffee was a stopgap on the way to another, more important career goal. Things however are changing.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge business - Allegra has calculated that cups drunk out of the home account for sales of around $60bn -$80bn per year globally and the coffee industry is now considered a viable career option in itself. Speciality coffee shops employ workers who are passionate about their trade and see it as an end in itself, not a route to their dream career. Poke your head into a fancy coffee joint in New York, Sydney or Singapore and the chances are you\u2019ll be served by someone who waxes lyrical about their latest beans in the same way as a craft brewer eulogises on a favourite ale.\n\nYou\u2019ll be served by someone who waxes lyrical about their latest beans\n\nYou won\u2019t be earning an investment banker\u2019s salary. In 2014 the Speciality Coffee Association of America found that, on average, baristas in speciality coffee shops in the US earned $22,000 a year basic salary. With an industry certification this salary rose to $24,500. Make the next step to become a roaster and you can expect on average $38,000, rising to nearly $40,000 with a certification. Baristas can also use their expertise to get a well-paid job in equipment sales and product sourcing.\n\nGlobally there are 40,000 professional baristas according to coffee research specialists, Allegra Strategies. Throw senior chain store baristas and senior brewers into the mix and the number swells to 200,000 in the US alone. Big chains such as Starbucks still account for the majority of coffee shops \u2013 a staggering 45,000 worldwide including 22,000 outlets but there are a sizeable number of independents; around 1,200 in the US and 450 in the UK.\n\nLondon, for its part, is an independent coffee shop hot spot. In the heart of Fitzrovia, a trendy, enclave north of the frenetic hub, Oxford Street is a plethora of high-end joints so certain of their value to espresso drinkers that the presence of coffee behemoths seemingly on every street corner, doesn\u2019t worry them.\n\n\u201cIf a rival opens five doors down, it makes us focus even more on what we offer,\u201d said Peter Dore-Smith, owner of coffee shop, Kaffeine. \u201cWe need to make sure our coffee, our food, our service, our atmosphere make our place somewhere people want to hang out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that go-getting attitude that marks out small independent outlets as the industry pioneers. Among the big drivers of the rise of \u2018barista craft\u2019 worldwide are international coffee competitions. In 2000 the inaugural World Barista Championships were held in Monte Carlo and since then it\u2019s spawned a host of other events globally.\n\nGareth Jones is the manager of the Fitzrovia branch of Workshop Coffee, a small chain. He takes his job and the chance to show off his skills in competitions, very seriously. But whilst winning is a bonus, the taking part is, in some ways, more important\n\n\u201cBaristas from around the world can get together, discuss ideas and move the industry forward. Competitions push you to improve, raise the quality and focus on the finer details.\u201d\n\nTaking the job seriously also brings financial rewards. Gareth earns around \u00a325,000 ($37,000) a year and down the road, Claire Brice manager of Kaffeine boasts a salary of \u00a332,000 ($48,000). Winning one of the big competitions can also mean thousands of dollars in equipment, trips abroad and of course the prestige of being the best.\n\nIt\u2019s this change in attitude and expectation which has helped elevate the barista trade from a fill-in job for college students to a caffeine-fuelled career.\n\nDo you have what it takes to be a coffee hot shot?

        "text": "To some, he is verging on a saint and martyr, singlehandedly standing against the forces of Chinese political repression. For others he is a canny manipulator, utterly in control of his reputation and place in the art world and market. For others still, he is all these things: an artist who outdoes even Andy Warhol in his ubiquity, his nimbleness at self-promotion and his use of every medium at his disposal to promulgate his work and his activism.\n\nWhatever your views on the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, one thing is clear: he is everywhere, from the Hampstead theatre in London, where Howard Brenton's play about the 81 days Ai spent in detention in 2011 is underway, to the web, where his the video for his heavy metal song Dumbass is circulating, to the Venice Biennale, where not one but three of his large-scale works are on display \u2013 perhaps the most exposure for any single artist at the international festival.\n\nOne of the works, Bang, a forest of hundreds of tangled wooden stools, is the most prominent piece in the German national pavilion. Then, in the Zuecca Project Space on the island of Giudecca, is his installation Straight: 150 tons of crushed rebar from schools flattened in the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, recovered by the artist and his team, who bought the crumpled steel rods as scrap before painstakingly straightening them and piling them up in a wave-like sculptural arrangement.\n\nBy far the most revealing about Ai's own experience, though, is the third piece, SACRED. Situated in the church of Sant'Antonin, it consists of six large iron boxes, into which visitors can peek to see sculptures recreating scenes from the artist's detention. Here is a miniature Ai being interrogated; here a miniature Ai showers or sits on the lavatory while two uniformed guards stand over him. Other scenes show him sleeping and eating \u2013 always in the same tiny space, always under double guard. (The music video refers to some of these scenes with a lightly satirical tone that is absent from the sculpture.)\n\nAccording to Greg Hilty of London's Lisson Gallery, under whose auspices SACRED is being shown, and who saw Ai in China a week ago, the work is a form of \"therapy or exorcism \u2013 it was something he had to get out. It is an experience that we might see as newsworthy, but for him, he was the one in it.\"\n\nThe uncanny hyperreality of the installation speaks of the fact that, according to the project's curator, Maurizio Bortolotti, \"the experience made him fix all the details like a nightmare\". For 81 days, said Hilty, he had nothing to do (aside from his periods being questioned) but memorise the minutest details of the tiny, featureless room in which he was kept. The outside of the metal boxes is entirely blank \u2013 Ai was brought there hooded. The only detail of the cell's exterior he observed was on his release, when he saw the number on the door: 1135.\n\nThe ecclesiastical setting, the title of the work, the appearance of the metal crates (which might resemble a reliquary or saint's coffin) suggest that Ai is positioning himself as a martyr. According to Hilty, however, \"He is not pretending to be a saint, but the setting does suggest things such as the stations of the cross, or the temptations of St Anthony, to whom the church is dedicated. But these are human, universal things that go beyond Ai Weiwei \u2026 he's not saying he's a saint, or that he is wholly right or good. He's just being honest.\n\n\"There is a reflex among artworld people that if he is strong as an activist you can't see him as an artist,\" Hilty added. \"But Ai shows a remarkable knack for working in different registers.\" The sculpture at the Venice Biennale should be seen as entirely different from the pop video, the blogging, the activism and the rest, Hilty suggested. \"He could be dismissed as a polemicist, an activist. But I hope people see these works and recognise that he can do all that and also step back and make art with profundity.\"",

A group of these vulnerable Democratic senators recently signed a letter to embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asking that the March 31st open enrollment deadline for Obamacare get pushed back.\n\nRepublicans in the House, meanwhile, may seek to increase the pressure this week by again voting to delay the mandate for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Calls for an individual mandate delay, fiercely opposed by the administration, will likely becoming overwhelming if the federal website is not functioning seamlessly by Dec. 1. Even if the mandate is delayed, the millions of young, healthy and currently uninsured people the law depends on to make the economics work could ultimately decide paying the penalty is better than buying insurance. That could spark a \"death spiral\" for the law, an outcome that would be devastating for the Obama presidency and Democrats hopes in 2014 and beyond.\n\nThe hearings begin on Tuesday but the main event comes Wednesday when Sebelius squares off against Republicans at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing.

The suspension also covers the postseason.\n\nRodriguez originally received a 211-game suspension from MLB in August due to his alleged ties to Biogenesis, an anti-aging clinic in South Florida which supplied performance-enhancing drugs. A number of high-profile players were suspended for their involvement in the scandal, including Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz, and Jhonny Peralta, but Rodriguez received the biggest penalty of them all, allegedly for interfering with MLB's investigation.\n\n(Read more: Elite athletes born all 'roided up: Data on books)\n\nWhile the other players connected to Biogenesis immediately accepted their suspensions, Rodriguez appealed and was able to finish out the season. Following a contentious arbitration process, Horowitz did not uphold the original ban, but this should be considered a major victory for MLB and commissioner Bud Selig. It is still the longest suspension under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention & Treatment Program. Guillermo Mota previously received a 100-game suspension in 2012.\n\nThe other big winner today, at least from a financial perspective, is the Yankees, who will no longer have Rodriguez's salary ($25 million) on the books for the 2014 season. They have a very good chance to keep their payroll under $189 million even if they sign Japanese right-hander Masahiro Tanaka.\n\n(Read more: Firms show off gadgets for drivers, parents, athletes)\n\nBelow is a statement from Alex Rodriguez, who intends to take his fight against MLB to federal court:\n\n\"The number of games sadly comes as no surprise, as the deck has been stacked against me from day one. This is one man's decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not involve me having failed a single drug test, is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the Joint Drug Agreement and the Basic Agreement, and relies on testimony and documents that would never have been allowed in any court in the United States because they are false and wholly unreliable. This injustice is MLB's first step toward abolishing guaranteed contracts in the 2016 bargaining round, instituting lifetime bans for single violations of drug policy, and further insulating its corrupt investigative program from any variety defense by accused players, or any variety of objective review.\n\nI have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I will take this fight to federal court. I am confident that when a Federal Judge reviews the entirety of the record, the hearsay testimony of a criminal whose own records demonstrate that he dealt drugs to minors, and the lack of credible evidence put forth by MLB, that the judge will find that the panel blatantly disregarded the law and facts, and will overturn the suspension. No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with, and I am exhausting all options to ensure not only that I get justice, but that players' contracts and rights are protected through the next round of bargaining, and that the MLB investigation and arbitration process cannot be used against others in the future the way it is currently being used to unjustly punish me.",

        "text": "The historical stereotype of prosthetic limbs is of military men - or pirates - stomping along on a peg leg or threatening people with a hook where their hand used to be. But prosthetics have a venerable history going back thousands of years \u2013 and the two earliest examples involved women.\n\nThe first record of a prosthetic limb is in a Sanskrit holy book from India written sometime between 3500 and 1800 BC, which relates how the warrior Queen Vishpla was fitted with an iron leg to replace one lost in battle. While Vishpla's leg has never been found, alas, archaeologists digging in Egypt in 2000 unearthed an artificial big toe estimated to be 3000 years old, attached to the mummy of a woman. The prosthetic toe showed a remarkable degree of sophistication, with three bendable joints. Wear and tear showed it had been used extensively during the woman's lifetime.\n\nIt wasn't until the 16th century that further major advances were made, when French surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 created prosthetics including mechanical hinged hands and locking knee joints which could be used to at least partially aid ordinary daily activities. But even though demand for prosthetics rose \u2013 generally driven by war - not much changed greatly in general appearance or function until after WW2.\n\nThe use of new materials such as plastic has today been superseded by prosthetics with a far more naturalistic appearance. \u201cCustomised silicone covers are available that match the amputee\u2019s sound limb in size, colour, shape and texture. This includes freckles, hairs and even creases in the joints,\u201d says Abdo Haidar, director at The London Prosthetic Centre.\n\nThe advent of computer aided design and better production processes has also made prosthetic limbs far more functional. Motorisation has also developed significantly. In 2007, UK researchers created a highly flexible motorised ankle which combined sensors to detect minute movements with micro-motors to adjust the ankle in response to uneven surfaces. This provided users with far more normal gait and greater stability.\n\nAbdo Haidar sees developments in the next decade focusing on the increasing blending of human and machine to boost senses of feeling plus mind control. \u201cMicroprocessors will improve at a much faster rate, while another advancing technology is osseointegration, which involves inserting an implant - accepted by the body as part of the bone - that allows artificial limbs and body parts to be permanently attached to it.\u201d\n\nBoosting sensations is a key area. In 2015, for example, Austrian scientists created an artificial leg which allowed the amputee to feel lifelike sensations from their prosthetic foot via sensors which measured pressures at the heel, toes and sole. Signals were relayed through the limb to sensors connected to the base of the stump, stimulating the nerve endings to relay signals to the brain.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago has been a pioneer of such 'bionic' prosthetics, including legs able to climb stairs with the minimum of fuss - not so easy for an artificial limb. Sensors detect speed changes, orientation and weight, feeding the data to built-in computer chips that guide the leg to respond to differences in terrain. The sensors in the prosthetic limb 'talk' to the patient's body via links to nerves in their thigh.\n\nLast year, meanwhile, engineers at John Hopkins University unveiled a robotic arm with 26 joints, capable of curling up to 45 pounds - and a modular construction allowing it to be taken apart and adapted in myriad ways to suit the needs of different people.\n\nThis Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) is also controlled by the user's mind via connections between over 100 sensors in the limb to nerves in the stump. Talking to the New York Times last year, chief engineer Mike McLoughlin revealed that as the remapped nerves grew through use, users were able to feel increasing sensation in the limb - to the point of detecting differences in texture.\n\nBritish researchers have led the way in bionic hands, beginning in the early 1960s with efforts at Edinburgh's Princess Margaret Rose Hospital to find prosthetic solutions for children affected by birth deformities caused by the drug Thalidomide. The hospital's Bioengineering Centre has became a global leader, with successes including the world's first electrically-powered shoulder in 1998.\n\nMaking high-tech prosthetics accessible... and affordable\n\nOlder readers may recall a 1970s series called The Six Million Dollar Man, where hero Steve Austin was 'rebuilt' into a bionic dude who used his super-charged skills at running or fighting to deal with bad folk every week. Putting a figure in the title flags up the very real issue of cost when it comes to bionic advances.\n\nTake the John Hopkins modular arm, which presently comes in at a whopping $500,000 each \u2013 a figure even its maker admits he would like to see come down to a tenth of that amount at least. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed a Maserati here, but what most people will want is a good Toyota,\u201d Mike McLoughlin told the New York Times last year.\n\n3-D printing may be one way to slash costs for basic prosthetic limbs. A basic arm with very minimal functions can already be printed for around $50, for example \u2013 albeit more for appearance than key day-to-day use. However, exiii Inc. is a recently-founded Japanese robotics company specializing in bionic arms, coming up with a 3-D printed limb called the handiii that comes in at under $5000.\n\nIts greatest success has arguably been the i-limb (nothing at all to do with Apple!). Brought to the market in 2007 via a company called Touch Bionics, the i-limb is a hand with five highly flexible digits, plus lifelike artificial skin. Refined over the years, the latest version \u2013 the i-limb quantum \u2013 includes customisable grips, a slim anatomically-correct design and a robust aluminium structure.\n\nIt also features a high level of digital control using software dubbed a biosim, allowing wearers to control hand movements via Bluetooth. More intuitive apps were added last year, while the hand itself was given 30% greater digit speed and strength. Over 200 people now have i-limb hands.\n\nAn artificial hand developed at John Hopkins, meanwhile, uses pressure sensors in the fingers wired to nerves in the upper arm to allows users to 'feel' the shape of objects, and also if they are hard or soft. Such improved sensory feedback offers more than a psychological boost. Users have found they can use the new sensations to greatly improve their control of the prosthetic hand - to the point of being able to pick the stem off a cherry!\n\nThe process by which prosthetics get 'thought control' is fairly straightforward in concept \u2013 but requires delicate surgery. Todd Kuiken at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago pioneered a key process a decade ago, called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR).\n\nThis uses the residual nerves from the amputated limb and transfers their links to alternative muscle groups. Computer chips inside the prosthetic are then connected to sensors that pick up motor signals from nerves in a patient's stump that formerly commanded limb movements, such as a hand opening or a knee bending. Because muscles are electrically active, they act as amplifiers for the nerve signals, strengthening them enough for the prosthetic sensors to pick them up and send them to motors that move the relevant bits of the artificial limb.\n\n\u201cAll of the direct neural-machine interfaces that connect to the peripheral nerves - outside of the brain and spinal cord - require surgical intervention,\u201d says Paul Marasco, a neuroscientist at the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute and leading prosthetics researcher. \u201cThese include placing different types of electrodes on or in the nerves, such as electrodes that are threaded in with a needle along the length of a nerve. The end-goals are to build a way to communicate with the nerve signals and the brain through normal channels. We can get people to view the limb as if it actually belongs to them.\u201d\n\nInitially, these signals could only be interpreted one at a time e.g. turn wrist, then open hand \u2013 resulting in motions that appeared robotic compared with the natural fluidity of the normal motion. However, more refined computer algorithms in the sensors now allow them to recognise patterns of movement to make things flow more naturally.\n\n\u201cThe long-term goal for all of this work is to have non-invasive ways to control a dexterous robotic device - no extra surgeries, no extra implants, said Robert Armiger, project manager for amputee research at the Johns Hopkins lab, speaking to the New York Times last year. His vision for the future is for limb users to be able to slip on a cap with sensors that would beam information from the brain to the prosthetic limb.\n\nToday's researchers have their hands \u2013 natural and bionic - full just getting prosthetics to mimic everyday activities. \u201cWe are still working on the basic processes of walking on inclines or stairs, and dressing, eating, and hygiene,\u201d admits Paul Marasco.\n\nThere are some more futuristic developments in the pipeline, however. The company Second Sight are behind one of the most exciting. Their Argus II is a visual prosthetic device that sits on top of the retina and links wirelessly to special glasses that can bypass damaged parts of the eye and send visual signals straight to the brain. The promise here is the ability to restore sight to a blind person in a similar way to the visors worn by the Jordy character in Star Trek: Next Generation. And that is a wonderful vision.",

Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat advice would you give your 22-year-old self today?\u201d is written by Michael Leabman, founder and CTO of Energous.\n\nLet me start out by saying I have a lot of advice for my 22-year-old self. But the most important parts are actually the same pieces of advice that I would give to anyone starting out\u2013whether that\u2019s a young entrepreneur or my own kids. For me, these life lessons translated into the achievement of a dream\u2013cheesy, but true: the creation of my own company. Here\u2019s to hoping they are valuable to others as well.\n\nMake your parents nervous It\u2019s never too early to follow your dreams. Over the years, I realized that my biggest mistakes were the result of not following my instincts or taking enough risks. It wasn\u2019t until I turned 30 that I started pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and consciously taking more chances. Early on, one of the biggest deliberate risks was trading in a stable position for a $0 salary. I wish I could say that everyone was supportive, and while my parents were, others said it would be impossible. In the end, following my gut led me to where I am today.\n\nSurround yourself with smart people You don\u2019t need to have all the answers to accomplish your end goal\u2013all you need to have is the vision and the passion to seek out the unknown. Whether it\u2019s family, friends, a business partner, or mentor (both personal and professional), surround yourself with people who can act as a sounding board or share valuable insights into challenging areas that you might not have expertise in. These people can help guide your ideas and provide support at various levels, which can prove tremendously valuable.\n\nKnow when to stop listening and follow your heart While it\u2019s helpful, and even critical, to subject yourself and your idea to the opinions and recommendations of other smart people, it\u2019s important to take all advice with a grain of salt. Consider, for example, if the person is truly staying within the bounds of their expertise, or if they have perhaps tried and failed at your vision using another approach. Challenges will happen frequently and you will cross paths with people who are non-believers, but doing something that you are passionate about makes it much easier to overcome obstacles you encounter along the way. For me, this advantage naturally pushes me towards solving a problem, as opposed to letting it upset me. I am thankful that I wake up every day and work on my dream.\n\nLearn from your experiences Last but not least, and one of the most valuable pieces of advice I can give is to realize that your first endeavor might not be successful\u2013and accept that from the beginning. Deliberately choosing to take more risks means you are also acknowledging that failure is a possibility, but realizing that without taking the risk you won\u2019t reap the benefits. The trick is to also commit to learning from your mistakes. For me, each career move is a stepping stone to something better. From your first job to your dream job and everything in between, there\u2019s value to be gained at every level, so embrace the small things and don\u2019t be afraid to push yourself outside of your comfort zone. You have everything to gain.",

        "text": "There is no question the United States has achieved a moral victory by finding and killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. More practically, the implications relating to geopolitical risk are much less certain. While some would argue that killing the head of al Qaeda is a positive development, there is also a credible case to be made that this action could potentially accelerate terrorist activity if bin Laden is perceived as a martyr by his brethren.\n\nIn assessing the impact of the death of bin Laden, it is important to note that he has been on the run from U.S. Special Forces for almost a decade. While figuratively bin Laden remained the head of al Qaeda, there is no doubt that being on the run reduced his effectiveness from an operational leadership perspective. With the entire CIA looking for him and a massive award on his head, bin Laden realistically didn\u2019t have the capability to micro manage al Qaeda operations. Therefore it is unlikely that the killing of bin Laden will dramatically reduce the threat from al Qaeda in the short term.\n\nStepping back for a moment, it is also important to note that the very nature and organization of al Qaeda remains very much in question. There are some analysts that question whether al Qaeda is as organized as is often portrayed by the press. In fact, as Marc Sagemen, a former CIA agent based in Islamabad, and author of Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, wrote:\n\n\u201cThere is no umbrella organization. We like to create a mythical entity called al-Qaeda in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with.\u201d\n\nThis is a controversial position and is widely disputed, but the reality is that al Qaeda is most certainly not organized akin to a Western criminal organization with specific command and control functions.\n\nTo this point, as of 2004, it was estimated that almost two-thirds of the senior leadership of al Qaeda had either been captured or killed. If this were a typical American crime family, it would be safe to assume the family would be out of business. This has not been the case for al Qeada. In fact, the July 2005 London bombings purportedly occurred without specific leadership from abroad. Conversely, the 2009 plot by three Londoners to detonate seven bombs on airliners bound for North America was tied directly to al Qaeda. These actions suggest that al Qaeda is alive and well despite this loss of \u201cleadership.\u201d\n\nWhile al Qaeda, as led by bin Laden, may have once provided funding or training for some of these groups, currently many them, as characterized by the 2005 London bombings, likely work largely independently. In fact, while bin Laden had at one time bankrolled al Qaeda, his ability over the past decade to do so was limited by the fact that he was cut off from the family fortune; and even if he still had some independent wealth, moving those funds would have likely given U.S. operatives information as to his whereabouts.\n\nConceptually, bin Laden\u2019s key role over the past decade seemed to have been to fan the flames of discord against the United States, and the Western world generally. In this effort, he was certainly successful and the al Qaeda network will likely need to fill this vacuum.\n\nUltimately, the real legacy of bin Laden is the hundreds of thousands of operatives that have been trained in al Qaeda terrorist camps. In fact, Gary Bernsten, a former senior ranking CIA official, and author of Jawbreaker, has estimated this number to be as high as 800,000. Despite the death of bin Laden, this large group of like-minded Islamic terrorists continues to exist.\n\nIt is also important to note that, based on the evidence, al Qaeda activities are typically planned years in advance of when they are actually intended to occur. Therefore, even if bin Laden were more directly involved in orchestrating broader terrorist activities of the al Qaeda network than we believe he was, it is still not likely that any potential attacks currently in the pipeline would necessarily be thrown off course. The primary example of this process is the September 11th attacks in the United States. According to reports, the idea for these attacks was germinated in 1996 and planning began in 1998, which was a full three years before they occurred.\n\nNot surprisingly, equity markets, as a proxy of investors\u2019 propensity to accept more risk, have completely shaken off any potential positive impact of bin Laden\u2019s death. This is partially because of the points outlined above, which suggest that killing bin Laden likely won\u2019t halt terrorist activity in the intermediate term, but also because there is real potential that bin Laden\u2019s death accelerates terrorist activity on the basis of avenging bin Laden. In fact, Hamas started stirring such emotions by stating the following in a press release:\n\n\u201cWe condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior. We ask God to offer him mercy with the true believers and the martyrs.\u201d\n\nWe certainly won\u2019t suggest that the world is not a better place with the death of bin Laden, but it is not quite clear that is a safer place, or that geopolitical risk premiums should be reset lower as a result. While the head of the serpent has been cut off, the snake is still very much alive.",

Power\u2019s latest North America Airline Satisfaction study.\n\nOverall passenger satisfaction with major airlines increased to 717 out of a possible score of 1000 in 2015, up from 712 a year ago, according to J.D. Power\u2019s study.\n\nHere are some of the major findings:\n\nThe study gauged passenger satisfaction among both business and leisure passengers in several key areas, including costs, fees, in-flight services, onboard experience and reservations. It was conducted between April 2014 and March 2015. J.D. Power distinguishes between \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201clow-cost\u201d carriers in its ranking, but Fortune combined them for this report.\n\nThe findings reflect another recent study on airline service, which also suggested airline service was trending higher.\n\nTo put these scores into a little perspective, the top-ranked airline would receive an equivalent letter grade of \u201cB-.\u201d The highest-scoring legacy carrier, Delta Air Lines, would get a \u201cC-.\u201d The lowest-ranked carriers receive a grade of \u201cD,\u201d according to its customers.\n\nAirlines still rank below banks and mortgage lenders, two other industries covered by J.D. Power. \u201cAirline customer service experience is low,\u201d says Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nWhat the findings mean for customers\n\nJ.D. Power says the findings show that customer service matters, perhaps now more than ever. In its view, the airline industry is evolving from a commoditized transportation business into a business focused on hospitality and services.\n\n\u201cThe carriers most focused on providing a pleasant experience are being rewarded with higher customer satisfaction and loyalty,\u201d says Garlick.\n\nHe says the study suggests that when passengers make the decision to fly an airline based on the services or experience the airline provides, rather than price, convenient routes and scheduling, satisfaction is higher and passengers are more likely to return to the airline brand and to recommend it to others.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason for the uptick in scores, and they have nothing to do with better service.\n\n\u201cPeople have adapted to the airline fees that use to upset them,\u201d adds Garlick. \u201cSo it might be more accurate to say people are less dissatisfied.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the J.D. Power numbers shows how various airlines succeeded \u2014 and failed.\n\nAmerican and Delta surged ahead by investing in their customer service infrastructure and training, with an emphasis on high-revenue business travelers. Alaska\u2019s downward swing can be explained by some of its growing pains, as it expands to new cities where passengers are less familiar with the brand. And the failure of airlines such as United and Frontier? Garlick says those airlines have focused on low fares and high fees, to the detriment of customer service.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants low-cost travel,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s a price to be paid for it. The low-ranked carriers are running their companies so frugally that not even their core customers are satisfied. They\u2019re willing to pay for a better experience.\u201d\n\nA long way to go\n\nCritics agree that airline service still has a way to go before it can be considered good. \u201cAs the airlines have been complaining that customers are treating their seats like commodities, the airlines themselves are treating their passengers \u2014 except frequent flier elites and first class \u2014 like self-loading cargo,\u201d says Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy organization for air travelers. \u201cOnboard services have been ratcheted back, extra and exorbitant fees are being loaded on passengers, and legroom and seat sizes continue to shrink.\u201d\n\nLeocha says investing in customer service doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. A simple smile from flight attendants or gate agents, waiving a standby fee to get on an earlier flight with empty seats, allowing families to sit together without paying more, all make the travel experience far more pleasant.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he adds, \u201cthese amenities still seem to be in short supply.\u201d",

According to data by Jefferies, the outstanding shares held by short sellers on Noble Group increased from 50 million shares in April to around 400 million now.\n\n\"[Despite the third buyback,] we continue to see the possibility of a dead cat bounce in Noble's shares. Near-term oscillators continue to point to the bearish side, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) still capped below 50 and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) line remaining under the signal and zero line,\" IG's market strategist Bernard Aw wrote in a note released Tuesday, adding that the 50-day moving average at S$0.828 will act as a \"formidable barrier\" for the stock.\n\nA dead cat bounce is a short-lived rally, often caused by short-covering, in a stock suffering from a prolonged decline.\n\nMost importantly, Aw said that weak underlying fundamentals remained the key obstacles for a recovery in the battered stock.\n\n\"The reality is that Noble is under pressure from several fronts, including a falling profit margin, a slowdown in commodity trading as well as issues relating to corporate governance and transparency. Piecemeal measures such as share buybacks are unlikely to relieve the downward pressure as long as the backdrop does not improve substantially,\" Aw said.\n\nFor CMC Markets' Nicholas Teo, the sustainability of the rebound depends on how aggressive Noble Group is with their share purchases.\n\n\"The rebound is relative on how much more the company wants to buy since they have in their authority to buy up to 673 million shares based on their filing. The shares they have bought thus far, with no pun intended, is only the tip of the iceberg,\" the Singapore-based analyst told CNBC by phone. Noble Group now holds more than 62 million shares by way of market acquisition.\n\n\"The aggressive buying has shown a floor in the share price and markets recognize that, regardless of whether the rebound is sustainable or not, so short sellers may not be so keen now. But the rebound above S$0.70 may also allow short sellers to have the opportunity to have another kick in the can,\" Teo added.\n\nShares of Noble Group have lost about 40 percent since February when anonymous group Iceberg Research released a series of critical reports on the Hong Kong trader's accounting practices. U.S. short seller Muddy Waters dealt another blow to the company in April after saying it had taken a short position on the stock.\n\nLast week, S&P downgraded the company's rating outlook to negative from stable, citing that the higher risk nature of Noble's trading positions could result in more volatile earnings and profitability for the company.",

        "text": "Stock markets are falling fast. After a dismal performance last week, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is struggling to climb back from a sharp early Monday drop, while markets all around the world have endured big losses.\n\nWhat\u2019s shaking investor confidence? In a word, China, where weak economic numbers and some increasingly desperate interventions by the state have awakened investors to the possibility of a painful slowdown.\n\nAdd in concerns about how malaise in China could hurt other developing countries, plus fears that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has lost its patience for necessary stimulus, and you have all the ingredients for a global sell-off.\n\nFor decades now, economic growth in China has been fiery, often reaching rates above 10 percent.\n\nBut those heady days of consistent, high-octane growth seem to be over. In the first half of 2015, China\u2019s growth rate was 7 percent, and that\u2019s if you believe the official numbers (for comparison, a recent independent analysis found that the true unemployment rate in China may be nearly three times the official rate).\n\nThe slump is part of a global wave of selling triggered by increased signs of an economic slowdown in China.\n\nFears were stoked earlier this month when China removed some of the limits on currency trading and the value of the yuan fell substantially. Even though the Chinese government was probably hoping for the yuan to lose some value, investors interpreted the drop as a sign of weakness.\n\nThat\u2019s because China was supposed to be moving past the export-first phase of its development \u2014 no longer just a place for companies to make cheap products, but a mature consumer market where companies from around the world can sell their goods to the growing Chinese middle class.\n\nAlso disconcerting was the way the Chinese government handled its July stock market collapse, where it intervened aggressively to prop up stock prices, suggesting that it isn\u2019t ready to let markets operate on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to exaggerate the connection between market fluctuations and events around the world. There\u2019s a lot of unpredictability in market movements, and it\u2019s often impossible to tease out the deeper forces driving markets.\n\nBut here\u2019s how the slowdown in China might be feeding the current troubles.\n\nThe most basic reason stock prices fall is because investors start to think \u2014 or fear \u2014 that companies are going to perform worse than previously anticipated. And if China is facing a severe economic slowdown \u2014 one that could hamper the development of a robust Chinese consumer class \u2014 some companies would indeed have a smaller market for their goods. That means lower profits, less money to share with investors, and lower stock prices.\n\nChina is far from the only thing weighing down markets. Other concerns include:\n\n\u25a0 Contagion: If China\u2019s economy really is slowing, lots of other countries will suffer alongside. As an example, a slowing China would probably need less oil, driving down oil prices and hurting oil-dependent economies like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u25a0 Rising interest rates: For months the Federal Reserve has been preparing investors for a hike in interest rates. But the point of raising rates is to keep the US economy from overheating. And with China\u2019s slowdown threatening the US economy, the big challenge may be to heat the economy back up, not cool it down.\n\n\u25a0 An overdue correction: The stock market has been outperforming the US economy ever since the Great Recession. There\u2019s some good reason for that, including the fact that corporate profits have been particularly strong. But the market can only run so far ahead of the real economy before some kind of correction sets in. And that may be what we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nSometimes a sharp downturn in the markets is followed by an equally sharp recovery. Other times, there\u2019s no such rapid rebound. After the black Monday sell-off in 1987, it took more than a year for the S&P 500 to recoup its losses. After the tech bubble burst in 2000, it took about six years.\n\nOne hopeful precedent is the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which swept through much of southeast Asia and initially sent the US stock market tumbling. Within a few months, all those losses had been recouped.\n\nThen again, in 1997 China was largely insulated from Asia\u2019s economic troubles. That\u2019s not true this time around, and it could mean a wider fallout, a slower recovery, and possibly some spillover from a stock market crisis into a full-on economic downturn.",

And, with house building falling to an 87-year low, just three housing schemes were granted awards.\n\nMany of the country's leading designers, including Zaha Hadid, David Chipperfield and Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, won accolades for buildings elsewhere in the EU rather than at home.

Far from being a size prize, the RIBA awards are for buildings that offer value to people's lives.\"\n\nThe memorial in Hyde Park to the victims of the 7 July 2005 bomb attacks on the London transport network, by Carmody Groarke, also won and is considered by some as a possible contender for the shortlist for the \u00a320,000 Stirling prize for building of the year, which is drawn from the RIBA award winners.\n\nEllis Woodman, architecture critic at the newspaper Building Design, said that other strong Stirling prize contenders included the Nottingham contemporary arts centre, the new British embassy in Warsaw, the Neues Museum in Berlin, Christ's College school in Guildford and Hadid's MAXXI museum.\n\nThe Oregon-born architect Rick Mather won most awards, gaining four.

Martin Clayton, curator of the exhibition \u2013 which will open in the Queen's Gallery at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh to coincide with the Edinburgh festival, and run on until mid-November \u2013 believes his work on anatomy could have transformed medical knowledge, but the results remained in his own notebooks until his death in 1519. He had intended to publish a major treatise but, like so much of his work, it was never completed as he was constantly distracted by new projects.\n\nAll the drawings had been imported into England by the 17th century, bound into an album which was probably bought by Charles II, and have been in the Royal Collection since at least 1690.\n\nSome of the anatomical drawings were exhibited in the Queen's Gallery in London last year, but the Edinburgh show will be the first to compare Leonardo's results with scalpel and pen with the best results of modern technology.\n\nClayton said: \"For the first time we will be displaying the artist's works alongside stunning examples of medical imaging, showing how the concerns and methods of the world's leading anatomists have changed little in 500 years, and how truly groundbreaking Leonardo's work was.\n\nThe exhibition will show how close Leonardo got in some of his last medical experiments to discovering the role of the beating heart in the circulation of the blood, a century before William Harvey worked it out.\n\nIn 1508 he dissected a 100-year-old man, and recorded accurately for the first time cirrhosis of the liver, and narrowing of the arteries. In the winter of 1510-11 he worked with the professor of anatomy dissecting 20 corpses in the medical school of Pavia, and covered his sheets of paper with multi-layered drawings from different angles of almost every bone in the human body including the first accurate depiction of the spine, and many of the major muscle groups.\n\nOne of the more famous drawings in the collection, of a baby in the womb \u2013 partly based on his dissection of a pregnant cow \u2013 will be displayed beside a 3D ultrasound scan of a foetus.\n\nHis drawings of a hand, beginning with the bones, adding the deep muscles of the palm and then the layers of tendons, will be displayed beside a film of a dissected hand in high definition 3D. His studies of the muscles of the shoulder and arm will also be compared with an animation of the same sequence, and a 3D film of a dissected shoulder which confirms the startling accuracy he achieved.\n\n\u2022 Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man, Queen's Gallery Holyroodhouse, 2 August \u2013 10 November 2013",

        "text": "The cellist Charlotte Moorman (1933-1991) was an intrepid performer who was central to avant-garde culture in New York during the 1960s and \u201970s\u2014the \u201cJeanne d\u2019Arc of New Music,\u201d the composer Edgard Var\u00e8se dubbed her\u2014even if many weren\u2019t sure how to evaluate her talents.\n\nWas she advancing the cause of free expression when she played on stage in the nude or wore a bra of televisions or was attached to a flight of balloons or let herself be covered in 20 pounds of chocolate fudge?\n\nOr did some of her antics become an excuse for men to ogle her and for the public to dismiss all unconventional art as a put-on? Was she, as well as being collaborator and muse for Nam June Paik in his revolutionary mixed-media pieces, also his stooge?\n\nThese questions were debated in New York\u2019s downtown artistic circles (especially by feminists) when she was alive. And they are quietly raised again in the celebratory exhibition and catalog \u201cA Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant-Garde, 1960s-1980s\u201d at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University, as well as in Joan Rothfuss \u2019s entertaining new biography, \u201cTopless Cellist: The Improbable Life of Charlotte Moorman.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Rothfuss\u2019s research, Moorman could have enjoyed a normal middle-class American life. Growing up in Little Rock, Ark., an only child who studied music and won the \u201cMiss City Beautiful\u201d contest at age 19, she was not a born rebel. Even after her move in 1957 to New York, where she attended the Juilliard School for a year and married a double-bassist, she envisioned herself playing cello in an orchestra or string ensemble.\n\nBut performing the classics, Moorman decided, was a bore compared to the offerings in New York\u2019s experimental music and art scene during the \u201960s. Her marriage annulled, she took up with a series of male mentors. (She ended up happily paired with the visual artist Frank Pileggi. )\n\nAn eccentric who never threw anything away, Moorman has left the show\u2019s six curators\u2014one of whom is Ms. Rothfuss\u2014with almost too much material to sift in presenting her flamboyant life. (Northwestern bought the artist\u2019s archive and has been organizing it since 2001.)\n\nIn addition to photographs of her in many productions, the exhibition has museum loans of Paik\u2019s video sculptures and a program of films and videos that shows her playing works by Paik (\u201cSonata for Adults Only\u201d) and others. There are cellos that Moorman fashioned, in neon or from syringes (used for her cancer treatments), as well as the felt-covered instrument that Joseph Beuys made for her to use in one of his works.\n\nAnnotated scores of music she performed by New York\u2019s avant-garde ( John Cage, Ornette Coleman, Paik) are here, along with her copy of Karlheinz Stockhausen \u2019s \u201cOriginale (Originals),\u201d a piece from 1964 in which she played the part of the \u201cString Player,\u201d wearing only gauze. Moorman was a key figure in helping these composers to introduce unpredictability, spectacle, danger and humor into the rarefied air of the classical music concert.\n\nOne way to liberate the audience, Paik believed, was to add nudity. In 1967 Moorman performed half-naked in his \u201cOpera Sextronique\u201d at a theater near Times Square. Arrested for indecent exposure, she spent the night in jail. The tabloid reporting on her trial, which resulted in a suspended sentence, defined her ever after in the public\u2019s mind as the \u201cTopless Cellist,\u201d a label she resented when she wasn\u2019t capitalizing on it.\n\nMoorman\u2019s packrat habits have proved invaluable in reconstructing a less well-documented phase of her career: her role as an impresario.\n\nIn 1963 she founded an annual Festival of the Avant Garde in New York. With almost no resources except her own vivaciousness, she produced it for 15 years, moving it around the city into nontraditional arenas for art and music\u2014Grand Central Terminal, Shea Stadium, Floyd Bennett Field, and the World Trade Center.\n\nThe walls and cases in the exhibition\u2019s second half are papered with her ads and programs for the festivals, supplemented by the photographs of Peter Moore, one of the few who attended all of these ephemeral events. Dozens of composers (Var\u00e8se, Cage, Morton Feldman, Luciano Berio ), filmmakers ( Bruce Conner, Jack Smith ), performance artists and dancers ( Allan Kaprow, Yoko Ono, Dick Higgins, Lucinda Childs ) participated because Moorman cajoled them.\n\nShe had \u201ca flair for getting EVERYBODY involved, including the more sophisticated who think Charlotte is silly; and she always somehow pulled it off,\u201d wrote the critic Jill Johnston in the Village Voice after one of these festivals.\n\nSome feminist artists in the \u201960s and \u201970s were wary of Moorman. Carolee Schneemann thought her a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d and the roster of her festivals was overwhelmingly male.\n\nThe public was more flummoxed. In a clip here from the Merv Griffin TV show, the studio audience laughs nervously as she holds a string down the back of Jerry Lewis and uses him to perform Paik\u2019s \u201cHuman Cello.\u201d\n\nA comedian in her own right, whose friendly smile and Southern accent could disarm most hostile crowds, Moorman knew that just because you weren\u2019t afraid to look ridiculous didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t serious.\n\nMr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.",

Although the rain has tapered off in some areas, floodwaters are still climbing up over scores of river banks. Traffic in the French capital was snarled as flooding choked roads, and several Paris railway stations were shut.\n\nWhile the Louvre's most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" was safe on an upper floor, officials said about 250,000 artworks were located in flood-risk areas, mostly in basement storerooms. The art was hastily being moved upstairs -- a move officials described as precautionary.\n\nThe Orsay museum, on the left bank of the Seine, was also closed Friday to prepare for possible flooding.\n\nA spokeswoman at the Louvre said museum had not taken such precautions in its modern history - since its 1993 renovation at the very least. She spoke on condition of anonymity in line with the museum's policy.\n\nAt the Louvre, disappointed tourists were being turned away.\n\n\"I am really sorry, but we're closed today,\" one staffer told visitors. \"We have to evacuate masterpieces from the basement.\"\n\nElsewhere in Europe, authorities were counting the cost of the floods as they waded through muddy streets and waterlogged homes.\n\nGerman authorities said the body of a 65-year-old man was found overnight in the town of Simbach am Inn, bringing the country's death toll to 10. France's Interior Ministry also reported the death of a 74-year-old man who fell from his horse and drowned in a river in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris, the second death in France.\n\nIn eastern Romania, two people died and 200 people were evacuated from their homes as floods swept the area, including one man who was ripped from his bicycle by a torrent of water in the eastern village of Ruginesti.\n\nSeveral other people in Europe were missing Friday, including a Belgian beekeeper who was swept away by the current while trying to save his hives from rising waters in the eastern village of Harsin.\n\nThe foul weather has compounded the travel disruptions in France, which is already dealing with the fallout from weeks of strikes and other industrial actions by workers upset over the government's proposed labor reforms. French rail company SNCF said the strikes had led to the cancellation of some 40 percent of the country's high-speed trains.\n\nIn addition, French energy company Enedis says that more than 20,000 customers are without power to the east and south of Paris.\n\nOutside the Louvre, tourists expressed understanding over the museum's closure.\n\n\"It's good that they are evacuating the paintings. It's a shame that we couldn't see them today, but it's right that they do these things,\" said Carlos Santiago, who was visiting from Mexico.",

Here is what\u2019s at stake for the Republicans and the Democrats:\n\nIt has been said before, but this time it may really be true \u2014 this is the last chance for Donald Trump\u2019s foes to stop him from winning the nomination. Trump currently has 996 delegates. He needs a total of 1,237 to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot at the party\u2019s convention in July \u2014 which would likely be his only chance at the nod, as it is thought that in an open convention Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or perhaps even another candidate like Mitt Romney would be nominated.\n\nCruz has no path to the nomination on the first ballot, but he could theoretically stop Trump from getting to 1,237 delegates. But several remaining states \u2014 including California and New Jersey \u2014 are likely to break for Trump. So if Cruz doesn\u2019t take the majority of the delegates in Indiana on Tuesday evening, his plan to Trump may die. The polls currently don\u2019t look good for Cruz, with Trump ahead in Indiana by an average of 10 points.\n\nHillary Clinton has stemmed Bernie Sanders\u2019 rising tide, posting a big win in New York last month and winning another handful of primaries a week later. Still, Sanders is vowing to stay in the race until the party\u2019s convention and fight for superdelegates along the way. If Sanders wins in Indiana, his plan may gain some degree of legitimacy. Sanders is currently trailing in the polls, but by just around 6%. The Vermont senator has outperformed his polling in the region before, so it is possible he\u2019ll do better than expected.",

        "text": "Choosing which 1040 tax form you need to file your return on can be a lot harder to figure out than you'd think, but answering just a few basic questions will lead you to the right version.\n\nFirst of all, if you use tax software to prepare your return, then it will generally take the decision of which tax form to file out of your hands. Instead, the software will evaluate the answers you provide to its list of questions and then select the most appropriate form for your needs.\n\nFor those who prepare their own returns, though, the basic Internal Revenue Service rule is that the best form to file is the simplest one that addresses all of your needs. The 1040EZ is the easiest form to fill out, with the 1040A being more complicated but still less difficult than the full 1040 form.\n\nForm 1040EZ is designed for the simplest returns. In order to use it, you have to meet several requirements.\n\nFirst of all, Form 1040EZ is only available for filing status of single or married filing jointly, and those who have dependents to claim can't use the form. Taxpayers have to be under age 65 and ineligible for higher standard deductions for the blind.\n\nIn addition, there are income-related restrictions. You can't have more than $100,000 in taxable income, and in general, it can only come from wages, salaries, tips, unemployment compensation and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Some taxable interest is allowed, but only if it's less than $1,500 for the year. Alaska residents are also allowed to use 1040EZ even if they receive Permanent Fund dividends from the state.\n\nFinally, the only credit you can claim on the 1040EZ is the Earned Income Credit, and you can't itemize deductions or make any other adjustments to income. Those who received advance payments of premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act aren't eligible to file Form 1040EZ. Those who hire household employees like babysitters or nannies for whom they have to pay employment taxes also can't file 1040EZ, as well as those who are debtors in bankruptcy filings after Oct. 16, 2005.\n\nForm 1040A has some of the same restrictions as 1040EZ. Income has to be less than $100,000, and you still can't itemize deductions. But it's more flexible in other areas. For instance, heads of household, qualifying widows and widowers, and married people filing separately can use Form 1040A.\n\nForm 1040A allows you to include more types of income. In addition to those allowed on 1040EZ, you can have ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions from mutual funds, pension and annuity income, IRA distributions, and taxable Social Security benefits and still file a 1040A. You can also claim deductions for IRA contributions, student loan interest, tuition and fee payments, and expenses that educators pay for supplies for their own classrooms.\n\nYou can also claim more credits on a 1040A. Those seeking credits for child and dependent care expenses, education expenses, and retirement savings contributions can use the form, as can those claiming credits for the elderly or disabled. Both the child tax credit and the additional child tax credit are available to 1040A filers.\n\nLastly, you can handle a limited number of special situations on 1040A. Those receiving dependent care benefits from work can use the form, as can those who have to pay taxes due to having past educational credits recaptured. Even some people who owe alternative minimum taxes can use Form 1040A.\n\nIf you don't qualify for 1040EZ or 1040A treatment, then your only choice is the long Form 1040. Most notably, that includes taxpayers who want to itemize deductions.\n\nFor those who want it, the IRS has developed a tool to help you figure out which form is the simplest available for your needs. You can access it at\n\n, and it will take information from the tax forms you've received from your employer, financial institutions, and other sources to make a recommendation.\n\nFiling your taxes can seem complicated. But by starting with the right form, you'll be able to keep things as simple as possible and avoid biting off more than you need to chew at tax time.",

        "text": "Taking Cuba off the list of nations that sponsor terrorism is the latest development that will attract foreign companies to the island. So who wants in? These five stats explain which industries present the most opportunities as Cuba opens for business.\n\nOne of the immediate benefits of renewed relations with Cuba is the increase in permitted remittance flows. The most recent figures put annual cash remittances to Cuba at approximately $5.1 billion, a level greater than the four fastest growing sectors of the Cuban economy combined. Now, permitted remittance levels from the U.S. will be raised fourfold, from $2,000 to $8,000 per year. This will help drive an increase in spending power in Cuba, which is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 4.6% through this decade. For global companies seeking a foothold anywhere they can, more money in the pockets of Cubans means more fuel for expansion. Take Coca-Cola. With an open Cuba, Coke could be legally be sold in every country in the world save one: North Korea.\n\n(Fortune, The White House, Euromonitor, Wall Street Journal)\n\n2. A lot more visitors\n\nJust 110 miles off the coast of Florida, Cuba should be a natural magnet for American travelers. Despite needing to meet special criteria to receive a visa from the State Department\u2014allowable categories include educational and journalistic activities\u2014170,000 Americans visited the country last year. As the restrictions slacken, the sky is literally the limit. JetBlue already charters flights to Cuba from the U.S., but the budget airline wants to start running regular commercial flights. American Airlines Group now flies to Cuba 20 times per week, a 33% increase in flights compared to just a year ago. More flights\u2014and more competition\u2014will make airfare more affordable, driving additional tourist traffic.\n\n(Travel Pulse, CNN Money, Wall Street Journal)\n\nOnly one in ten Cubans regularly use mobile phones and only one in twenty have uncensored access to the Internet. Even state-restricted Internet penetration currently stands at just 23.2%. The telecom infrastructure is so underdeveloped that an hour of regulated Internet connectivity can cost up to 20% of the average Cuban\u2019s monthly salary. There\u2019s serious demand for the major infrastructure investments needed to improve these numbers. Some start-ups are making waves in spite of shoddy internet. Airbnb, a website that lets people rent out lodging, announced that it has started booking rooms in Cuba with over 1,000 hosts. It gets around the lack of Internet by teaming with middlemen who have long worked to link tourists with bed and breakfasts.\n\n(Wharton, Freedom House, Fast Company)\n\n4. A cure for Cuba\n\nCuba has the third highest number of physicians per capita, behind only Monaco and Qatar. They\u2019re even used as an export: Venezuela pays $5.5 billion a year for the almost 40,000 Cuban medical professionals who now make up half of its health-care personnel. Cuban doctors lack access to most American pharmaceutical products and, importantly, to third-generation antibiotics. For its part, Cuba\u2019s surprisingly robust biotech industry makes a number of vaccines not currently available in the U.S. With the normalization of relations, Cuba can look to fully capitalize on its medical strengths.\n\n(Bloomberg, World Health Organization, Modern Healthcare, Brookings)\n\nCuba currently attracts around $500 million in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014good for just 1% of GDP. Given its tumultuous political history and underdeveloped economy, it is difficult to accurately predict how quickly investors will flock once the embargo has been lifted. But a good comparison might be the Dominican Republic, another Caribbean nation with roughly the same size population as Cuba. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that Cuba could potentially attract as much foreign capital as the Dominican Republic, which currently receives $17 billion in FDI ($2 billion from the U.S). But this won\u2019t happen overnight\u2014in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom, Cuba ranks 177th out of 178, ahead only of North Korea.\n\n(Wharton, ASCE, Peterson Institute, Heritage Foundation)",

Nothing I could do about it but watch storm footage on CNN International while drinking non-alcoholic Budweiser (no booze in the kingdom) and listening to the sounds of the muzzein calling Muslims to worship at the mosque behind the Marriott.\n\nThat was the same month that the financial crisis hit, and on the day of Lehman Brothers' ( LEHMQ - news - people ) collapse I spent the evening with billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal at his camp in the desert outside of Riyadh. We sat in the open air, under a starry sky, on an expanse of Persian rugs that must have taken up a quarter-acre. He was attended by a cadre of Bedouin servants who wore little pistols in their belts and continually refilled our little china cups with strong yellow Arabian coffee. A news junkie, the prince had three mega-screen TVs set up across the island of rugs from us. The biggest one in the middle was tuned to CNBC. The others showed pilgrims in Mecca walking around the Kaaba. It was the holy month of Ramadan. As we watched coverage of the financial collapse, Al-Waleed had the awesome idea of text-messaging CNBC's Maria Bartaromo his thoughts on Lehman. I think he was doing it mostly to show off that he had Maria's number in his phone, and I was impressed when she responded to his text 10 minutes later and asked him to be on her show the next day.\n\nLater in the evening I watched in disbelief as a line of about 500 Saudi men formed in the darkness, and one by one the men came forward to pay homage to the prince and ask him for some form of charity (money for a car, tuition, dowry, debts, etc). Several young men recited poems to the prince, who all the while continued to watch TV or check his phone. He holds court like this every week, giving away millions in patronage each year. The prince spends a lot of time in the desert and says he doesn't go to sleep until he sees the sky begin to brighten with dawn.\n\nA couple days later I found myself in the desert again, this time in the white-leather backseat of a 10-year-old Crown Victoria being driven the four hours from Riyadh to Damman, where I was to tour the headquarters of oil company Saudi Aramco. During Ramadan Saudis are barred from eating or drinking anything from sunup to sundown. But there was no prohibition on rock and roll; the driver, without comment, popped a cassette tape of Aerosmith's greatest hits into the stereo, and we screamed over the pristine blacktop at 90 miles an hour. Finally, when the red ball dipped under the desert horizon, my driver pulled into a truckstop (which, other than oilfield flares and a few camels, was the only sign of life in the desert) and bought us some snacks and water. I had been abstaining from food during the day as well, in part to see how the Saudis did it, and also because there was none for sale until nightfall. A few minutes later the driver pulled off the road to pray. I sat in the parked car and ate the most delicious bag of chips ever, all the while marveling that Aerosmith's \"Crazy\" was a much better song than I ever remembered. The full moon rose orange.\n\nRead more \"glimpses\" in our On The Road special report.",

It is totally unacceptable for anyone to tarnish its reputation by using old Mexican small-town vote-rigging tactics either to get back at Mrs Josefina Vazquez\u00b4s use of The Economist at the first televised presidential debate against Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or as a propaganda tool in the next debate.\n\nLet\u00b4s see the numbers.For those unfamiliar with Mexico\u00b4s presidential election to be held July 1, 2012,there are four candidates.One of them, from the teacher\u00b4s union, has never polled above 5%.The ones with real chances are Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto from PRI, who polled formerly as high as 42% and now in the low 30s; Mrs.Josefina Vazquez, from the ruling center-right PAN,now in third and formerly in second place, polling in the high 20s, and Mr. AMLO from the center-left PRD, now in second place, polling in the low 30s but behind Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Some polls speak of a four point spread between the two, others point to a ten point spread.\n\nBut the essence of the matter is that all parties as well as the voters they represent are united in this: they are all against PRI and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto ever claiming back the presidency they lost in the year 2000.Thus if Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto has 34% or 42 % of the votes, by definition that means that either 66% or 58% of all voters are opposed to the proposition that \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your poll shows 30% of the people opposing your motion instead of the 60-70% indicated by all polls conducted in Mexico is a first sign of trouble.Only the staff at The Economist knows how many votes have originated outside Mexico.If the numbers do not change much once these non-Mexico originated votes have been removed, the idea of vote manipulation gathers strength.\n\nNow, the people most likely to read this newspaper in Mexico, and thus vote in your debate, are naturally highly educated professionals.But you see, the latest poll gruporeforma.blogs.com/encuestas confirms the well-known fact that this demographic is overwhelmingly against the PRI, and has been so for at least 20 years, if not more.The affluent and well-educated are mostly PRD and to a certain extend PAN.In Mexico City, for example, PRD has a twenty-point lead.The actual numbers nationwide are:For voters with only primary education PRI 41%,PRD 30%, PAN 25%.For voters with college education:PRI 28%, PRD 43%, PAN 21%.Therefore, among the people most likely to read TE less than 30% would agree with your proposition, yet your numbers show just the opposite result.\n\nOr do they? Well, actually the opinions stated in your 116 Opening Comments,50 Rebuttal Comments, 541 Opening Recommendations and 286 Rebuttal Recommendations if carefully tabulated and analyzed are totally supportive of those rough numbers of 70% of voter\u00b4s negating PRI\u00b4s returning to the Presidency and below 30% believing \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your comments are in statistical agreement with the numbers we would expect from a multitude of polls, while your poll debate numbers are so divergent as to be mirror images of the former is a clear indication of voter fraud.\n\nIf we read carefully the 116 Opening Comments we see only 105 are real comments, since people sometimes mistakenly click on to post before they have actually written any comment.About 10% of these 105 indicate no decision on the debate\u00b4s proposition, but rather speak of various tangential matters such as the convenience for non-Mexicans to abstain from voting(the opinion of that gentleman who wisely retired to sunny Portugal,SaintMartinian),or to buy beach-front property(YukonDave),teachers saying they will use the debate in their classroom...and a funny Mexican who thinks his country would be better served if it were a colony of Sweden or The Netherlands(recommended by 3)...or another one who says Mexico would have been better off if it had not declared independence from Spain.",

They were organised into a cohesive force by Castao in 1997. It exists outside the law but often coordinates its actions with the Colombian military, in a way similar to the relationship of the Lebanese Phalange to the Israeli army throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAccording to a 1989 Colombian Secret Police intelligence report, apart from training Carlos Castao in 1983, Israeli trainers arrived in Colombia in 1987 to train him and other paramilitaries who would later make up the AUC.\n\nFifty of the paramilitaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest\u00e2\u0080\u009d students were then sent on scholarships to Israel for further training according to a Colombian police intelligence report, and the AUC became the most prominent paramilitary force in the hemisphere, with some 10,000-12,000 men in arms.\n\nThe Colombian AUC paramilitaries are always in need of arms, and it should come as no surprise that some of their major suppliers are Israeli. Israeli arms dealers have long had a presence in next-door Panama and especially in Guatemala.\n\nIn May of last year, GIRSA, an Israeli company associated with the Israeli Defence Forces and based in Guatemala was able to buy 3000 Kalashnikov assault rifles and 2.5 million rounds of ammunition that were then handed over to AUC paramilitaries in Colombia.\n\nIsrael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military relations with right-wing groups and regimes spans Latin America from Mexico to the southernmost tip of Chile, starting just a few years after the Israeli state came into existence.\n\nSince then, the list of countries Israel has supplied, trained and advised includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela.\n\nBut it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only the sales of planes, guns and weapons system deals that characterises the Israeli presence in Latin America.\n\nWhere Israel has excelled is in advising, training and running intelligence and counter-insurgency operations in the Latin American \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty war\u00e2\u0080\u009d civil conflicts of Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and now Colombia.\n\nIn the case of the Salvadoran conflict - a civil war between the right-wing landowning class supported by a particularly violent military pitted against left-wing popular organisations - the Israelis were present from the beginning. Besides arms sales, they helped train ANSESAL, the secret police who were later to form the framework of the infamous death squads that would kill tens of thousands of mostly civilian activists.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, 83% of El Salvador's military imports came from Israel, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. By 1981, many of those in the civilian popular political movements who had survived the death squads headed for the hills to become guerrillas.\n\nBy 1981 there was an open civil war in El Salvador which took over a decade to resolve through negotiations.\n\nEven though the US was openly backing the Salvadoran Army by 1981, as late as November 1983 it was asking for more Israeli \u00e2\u0080\u009cpractical assistance\u00e2\u0080\u009d there, according to a declassified secret document obtained recently by Aljazeera.\n\nAmong the assistance asked for were helicopters, trucks, rifles, ammunition, and combat infantry advisors to work at both the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompany and battalion level of the Salvadoran Army\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nOne notable Salvadoran officer trained by the Israelis was Major Roberto D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubuisson, who always held a high opinion of the Israelis. It was Major D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubuisson who ordered the assassination of El Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s archbishop amongst thousands of other murders.\n\nLater he would organise the right-wing National Republican Alliance Party (ARENA) and send his son to study abroad in the relative safety of Israel.\n\nAmazingly, while the Israelis were training the El Salvadoran death squads they were also supporting the anti-semitic Argentine military government of the late 1970s and early 1980s - at a time when that government was involvedin another \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty war\u00e2\u0080\u009d of death squads and disappearances.\n\nIn 1978, Nicaragua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dictator Somoza was making his last stand against a general uprising of the Sandinista-led population who were sick of his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynasty which had ruled and monopolised the county for half a century. The Israelis and the US had been supplying Somoza with weapons for years. But when President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1976 he ordered a cessation of all US military assistance to Nicaragua.\n\nIsrael utilised Carter's humanrights policy to its advantage\n\nFilling the void, the Israelis immediately increased their weapons supplies to Somoza until he fled the country when the Sandinistas took power.\n\nIsraeli operatives then helped train right-wing Nicaraguan Contras in Honduran and Costa Rican camps to fight the Sandinista government, according to Colombian police intelligence reports Aljazeerahas obtained.\n\nAt least some of the same Israeli operatives had also previously trained the nucleus of the paramilitary organisations that would become the AUC in Colombia.\n\nBut by far the bloodiest case of Israeli involvement in Latin America was its involvement in Guatemala from the 1970s to the 1990s. As in El Salvador, a civil war pitted a populist but, in this case, mainly Indian left against a mainly European oligarchy protected by a brutal Mestizo Army.\n\nAs Guatemalan President Carlos Arana said in 1971, \"If it is necessary to turn the country into a cemetery in order to pacify it, I will not hesitate to do so.\"\n\nThe Israelis supplied Guatemala with Galil rifles, and built an ammunition factory for them, as well as supplying armoured personnel carriers and Arava planes. Behind the scenes, they were actively involved in the bloodiest counter-insurgency campaign the hemisphere has known since the European conquest, in which at least 200,000 (mostly Indians) were killed.\n\nLike Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original occupation of Palestine, several entire Guatemalan Indian villages were razed and a million people displaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe guerrilla is the fish. The people are the sea. If you cannot catch the fish, you have to drain the sea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Guatemalan President Rios Montt in 1982.\n\nIsraeli arms and training fuelledGuatemalan unrest\n\nGuatemalan army officers credit Israeli support with turning the tide against the uprising, not only in the countryside where Israeli counter-insurgency techniques and assistance set up strategic-hamlet-like \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevelopment poles\u00e2\u0080\u009d along the lines of the Israeli kibbutz, but also in the cities where \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsraeli communication technicians and instructors\u00e2\u0080\u009d working through then-sophisticated computers were able to locate and then decimate guerrillas and their supporters in Guatemala City in 1981.\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the 1990s, the US could not overtly support the Guatemalan army because of its horrendous human rights record (although there was some covert support), but many in the US government, especially in the CIA, supported Israel in taking up the slack.\n\nBut the US grew to regret its actions. On 10 March 1999, US President Bill Clinton issued an apology for US involvement in the war: The \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnited States... support for military forces or intelligence units which engaged in violent and widespread repression...was wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No similar statement has ever been forthcoming from the Israelis.\n\nAt the present time, the only major insurgency war in Latin America is in Colombia, where Israel has an overt involvement.\n\nBesides the dozen or so Kfir IAI C-7 jet fighters they have sold the Colombian government, and the Galil rifles produced in Bogota under licence, most of the Israeli ties to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counter-insurgency war are closely-guarded secrets.\n\nAljazeera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to obtain clarification on these and other issues for this story were stonewalled by the Israeli embassy in Washington.\n\nWhy does Israel continue to provide arms and expertise to the pariahs of the world? Clearly, part of the reason is the revenues produced by arms sales, and part of it has do with keeping up with trends in counter-insurgent war across the globe.\n\nBut another factor is what is demanded of Israel by the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only superpower, the US, in partial exchange for the superpower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued support for Israeli dominance in the Middle East.\n\nThis relationship can be best illustrated by recently declassified 1983 US government documents obtained by the Washington, DC-based National Security Archives through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nOne such declassified document is a 1983 memo from the notorious Colonel Oliver North of the Reagan Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Council and reads: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs discussed with you yesterday, I asked CIA, Defense, and State to suggest practical assistance which the Israelis might offer in Guatemala and El Salvador.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother document, this time a 1983 cable from the US Ambassador in Guatemala to Washington Frederic Chapin shows the money trail.\n\nHe says that at a time when the US did not want to be seen directly assisting Guatemala, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have reason to believe that our good friends the Israelis are prepared, or already have, offered substantial amounts of military equipment to the GOG (Government of Guatemala) on credit terms up to 20 years...(I pass over the importance of making huge concessionary loans to Israel so that it can make term loans in our own backyard).\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn other words, during civil wars in which the US does not want to be seen getting its hands dirty in Latin America, the superpower loans Israel money at a very good rate, and then Israel uses these funds to do the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty work\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

        "text": "A detail from Saying Farewell at Xunyang, by Qiu Ying, c1500-50 Photograph: John Lamberton/Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art\n\nOn 5 August 1473, a young artist drew the first ever landscape. The date is known precisely because Leonardo da Vinci wrote it on the sheet of paper, as if aware of the revolutionary nature of what he was doing. To look at mountains and trees just for themselves was unprecedented.\n\nOr was it? The invention of landscape painting is one of the great moments of European art. Painting nature is a way to get inside yourself. To this day, people enjoy doing watercolours in the outdoors as a form of meditation. Leonardo's discovery of the mystery of nature \u2013 which you see in all his paintings, with their dreamy rocks and pools \u2013 is the invention of a new kind of inner life.\n\nYet it is a lot less original than we might like to think. There is an uncanny likeness between Leonardo's rocks, trees and rivers and the rocks, trees and rivers that Chinese artists were painting centuries before he was born. It is bizarre: that 1473 drawing actually looks like a reworking of classic Chinese paintings such as Li Gongnian's Winter Evening Landscape. When was that painted? I look at the label in the V&A's new exhibition Masterpieces of Chinese Painting. It says 1120. That's 353 years before the very similar sketch by Leonardo.\n\nIt is conventional, nowadays, to pay lip service to the fact that many versions of art exist, that beautiful art comes from all over the world and every way of life. Yet the story of art that most of us absorb \u2013 as told in The Story of Art by EH Gombrich, first published in 1950 and still the definitive account of art's progress \u2013 puts European innovation at the centre of the action. All peoples make art, but the west takes it forward.\n\nMasterpieces of Chinese Painting is the most devastating refutation of such assumptions I have ever seen. It shows that during the Song dynasty, at a time when Europeans were fighting barbaric crusades and had long forgotten the creativity that flourished in ancient Greece, artists in China were taking painting to heights of sensitivity and poetry that would not be attained elsewhere until the ages of Leonardo \u2013 or for that matter, when you look at the most radical Chinese touches, Van Gogh.\n\nI'd go further. Looking at this show being installed and talking to its curator Zhang Hongxing, I can't resist airing the theory that Leonardo stole the idea of landscape painting from China. Could he somehow have seen Chinese paintings? Might something have reached the west along the Silk Road? Excitedly, I get Leonardo's 1473 drawing up on my iPad and hold it among the 12th-century Chinese landscapes for comparison. The shapes of the hills and trees in Leonardo's sketch perfectly mirror the sugar-loaf peaks and willowy trees in 900-year-old Chinese paintings.\n\nZhang's well aware of this idea: it was raised very seriously in the 1950s, he says, but there is no proof. It's a mystery. Nor is Leonardo the only European pioneer of landscape who looks \"Chinese\". Zhang points out that Pieter Bruegel the Elder is also very \"Chinese\" looking. This is true. Bruegel's much-loved Hunters in the Snow has all the elements that delighted medieval Chinese landscape painters, including all that snow.\n\nBut why did China invent landscape art in the first place? Why did artists begin to depict, not gods and battles as elsewhere, but the grandeur of nature? It has something to do with Buddhism, which spread to China before AD1,000 and inspired a culture of contemplation. It also has to do with the technical achievements of the Song era. The scientific mind that perfected porcelain also looked at nature with a new clarity.\n\nOne of the first things you see in the show was actually painted by a Song emperor \u2013 though it comes with a warning to rulers, for Emperor Huizong's dreamy fascination with art helped to lose him his throne. Indeed, as the curator explains, painting in China has always been associated with retreat and escapism. Not all the works in this exhibition are landscapes. There are pictures of courtesans and the tremendous Nine Dragons, a dazzling mythic vision painted by Chen Rong in 1244. Yet for me, the escapist pursuit of pastoral in China's pioneering landscapes is utterly beguiling. After the Mongols conquered China there was a clear association of art with the rejection of power. Turning their backs on the court, intellectuals created gardens, wrote poetry and painted expressive scenes of wintry trees. They rendered nature in a free, subjective style that anticipated \u2013 and of course, influenced \u2013 Van Gogh.\n\nPersonally, I am convinced that Leonardo must have got access to the art of China. He was fascinated by the east and once applied for a job in Istanbul, offering to serve the Ottoman empire and praising Allah in a letter that survives. Did all this interest in Asia lead him to some hushed library where he unrolled a silk scroll and saw mountains, cherry blossoms and water?\n\nOne thing is certain. Zhang's great exhibition turns the story of art upside down.",

        "text": "When the dust settles on this year of spectacle and recession-proof Olympic construction, of teetering steel pointing to the sky, of swinging cranes, mayoral openings and breathless press releases, of the mighty Shard and the risible Orbit, one of the most memorable works will turn out to be something invisible above ground, and largely the creation of little-known 1950s engineers. This is the conversion of the oil tanks of the former Bankside power station in London \u2013 a clover of three buried concrete cylinders \u2013 into new spaces for performance and exhibition for Tate Modern, which is what the power station became in 2000.\n\nThis project is by the Basel-based firm of Herzog & de Meuron, architects of that icon of icons, the stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics \u2013 or Bird's Nest, as the architects don't like it to be called. The stadium set out to be a modern Eiffel Tower and succeeded, impressing its image on global television audiences of billions: of all the attention-seeking buildings of recent years, it commanded as much attention as any.\n\nThe Tanks at Tate Modern are a work of uncovering as much as addition, and finding rather than making, and there is not much chance that they will imprint their image on the world's imagination. You may indeed not be overwhelmingly excited by the photographs on this page, as the Tanks are hard to capture with a lens. They are voids rather than objects, things to be experienced rather than seen.\n\nThey are not, however, exactly modest. Each has a height of 7 metres and a diameter of 30 metres. Built to hold the fuel that powered the turbines that generated electricity for a large chunk of the capital, and to withstand the risk of explosion, they are thick-walled and capacious, a trefoil of inside-out towers, or a castle in negative.\n\nThey have the confident geometry of things made not for appearance but for a substantial practical use, and their concrete surfaces have a raw force. They are impressive just for being there, and the architects' approach has been largely to let their size and mass speak for themselves.\n\nOne cylinder has been made into a performance space, another into a room for temporary installations with a preference for those using moving images. The third tank has been subdivided into the functions, such as dressing rooms, needed to serve the other two. Floors, ceiling and lighting have been added as necessary to fulfil their new tasks. On the approach to the Tanks you see an archaeology of patches and slatherings of concrete, marks of the changes and repairs made to the structure over the years.\n\nUnless you are a connoisseur of concrete techniques during the second Elizabethan era, you don't greatly distinguish between the changes made this year and those of a half-century ago. As in Astley Castle in Warwickshire, you're presented with a composite of past and present, where the joins between the two are not strongly marked. For an architect on such projects, according to Pierre de Meuron, \"it is mostly good advice to disappear, as you leave your traces anyway. It looks as if it has been so forever but it was actually different before.\" The urge to dramatise what is already impressive has been avoided.\n\nRooflights could have been added, such that daylight could have gushed into the Tanks and made them into romantic Piranesian ruins, but Jacques Herzog says this \"would have been a trap \u2013 it becomes kitsch if you make too much of it\". The way that he and de Meuron have designed it is to stress that \"it is really an underground space\". Each tank has \"a door and that's it. It's just very straightforward.\"\n\nThe effect of this approach is to flatten the experience of the Tanks, such that their scale grows on you rather than amazes you all at once.\n\nIt also allows them to function as background to the performances and installations they will hold, rather than be the star turn in themselves. They will only be completed by the things that will happen in them, which is as it should be. And if you want drama there is no shortage of it in the Turbine Hall next door, or in a multi-storey twisted brick pyramid that is about to rise over the Tanks.\n\nIt's tempting to see the fondness of digging and revealing as a sign of our less shiny times, and it can also be seen in the same architects' Serpentine Pavilion, and their plans for renovating the giant Park Avenue Armory in New York, but as the Tanks and the pyramid together will cost \u00a3215m, this new modesty would have to be taken at a purely symbolic level. It would be more accurate to see it as a continuation of the original idea of 1994, when it was first decided to make an old power station into the Tate's new gallery of modern art.\n\nThe plan was derided at the time, as a backward-looking, heritage-obsessed failure to take the opportunity to commission proud new buildings, but the success of the Turbine Hall showed that it can be as powerful to use and modify found spaces as make new ones. The Tanks, meanwhile, remained a great secret place, buried beneath the grass behind Tate Modern. It was a particular obsession of Tate's director Nick Serota (who liked, evidently, to park his tanks under the lawn) to bring them into use.\n\n\"I want those oil tanks,\" he told his architects, \"even if I don't know how to use them,\" and eventually art based on performance and moving images provided the reason, and Tate's genius for fundraising came up with the cash. And so an intriguing new republic has been added to Tate's imperium, or a new district to its city of art. Visitors will now have a reason to turn right after passing through Tate Modern's main entrance, where at the moment all the interest is on the left.\n\nThere is an obvious danger in pursuing space for its own sake, which is that whatever goes in it feels like a pretext, a token gesture embarrassed by its setting. There is also a danger that Tate's relentless expansion will bloat it, and make it in the end an exhausting barrage of over-spectacular presentations. With an exhibition area of 1,800 sq metres, the Tanks are more than half as big as the not-small Turbine Hall, and exceed the display space of entire regional galleries, such as the Turner Contemporary in Margate.\n\nBut at this point, not yet tested by use, the Tanks feel credible.\n\nThere seems to be a purpose to their intended programming with film and performance, and they are distinctive enough \u2013 exceptionally so \u2013 to be rather more than another dollop of space in the Tate's halls. In the end, these underground chambers are simply extraordinary places, of a kind that would not now be invented from scratch. It would have been a shocking not to make use of them.\n\nThe Tanks at Tate Modern, London SE1 open on 18 July with Art in Action, a 15-week festival of performance and installation art",

It\u2019s soon clear why they\u2019re both off their dating game: Lauren has a couple of unruly boys and a smugly useless ex (Joel McHale), while widowed Jim tries hard with his three girls, but is better at teaching them basketball than at helping them navigate puberty.\n\nA contrived coincidence involving Lauren\u2019s brassy friend (Wendi McLendon-Covey) gives both Jim and Lauren the opportunity to jump on a family trip to Africa for cheap. The two are irked to meet again, but gradually, each fills a void in the other\u2019s brood. Lauren is great with lullabies, and rightly points out that Jim\u2019s oldest daughter (Bella Thorne) might prefer something girlier than the barbershop haircuts he gets her. (Uncomfortable tomboy jokes are only made odder by Thorne\u2019s resemblance to Keira Knightley.) Jim, meanwhile, knows just what Lauren\u2019s younger boy (Kyle Red Silverstein) needs: a father figure who actually cares. Enough, even, to join him in cartoonish craziness like ostrich riding.\n\n\u201cYou gotta show up for your kids,\u201d Jim tells Lauren in a likably sentimental bit of parental philosophizing. Of course, this being an Adam Sandler movie, he and director pal Frank Coraci (\u201cWedding Singer,\u201d \u201cClick\u201d) hedge their narrative bets by glopping on the anything-goes humor that fans expect.\n\nSome of it works. Sandler and Barrymore have some great interaction with Alyvia Alyn Lind, who plays Jim\u2019s youngest daughter with a very funny mouths-of-babes streak. But while a Greek chorus styled like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and led by preening Terry Crews is gleefully wacky, don\u2019t be surprised if the caricatured African setting draws some complaints. The location feels more like a random choice than a thematically relevant one, and at times it plays like an ad for South Africa\u2019s infamously segregated Sun City resort.\n\nFunny thing, though: The sunnier that Barrymore gets in her scenes with Sandler, the more the iffy elements and leaden bits seem to just melt away. Blend in more of that spirit, and their latest pairing might rate better.",

In those days intelligence tests, developed during World War I, were accepted as an infallible means of identifying the \u201chighly intelligent.\u201d\n\nHe called attention to the problem by denouncing higher education as more devastating to the human race than war.\n\nIn 1929 he said that the fu\u00adture would see a larger pro\u00adportion of Negroes in the North than in the South, a forecast that anticipated the movement of the Negro north but exag\u00adgerated its scope. He advanced evidence that Southern Negroes were able to adapt to the more rigorous climate of the north.\n\nMost of Dr. Holmes's chal\u00adlenging statements reflected the position of some of the pioneers of eugenics, who were unaware that large gaps existed in their knowledge.\n\nIn 1939, as president of the Western division of the Ameri\u00adcan Association for the Ad\u00advancement of Science, he urged the substitution of a Darwinian code of morals for the ancient Hebraic and Christian codes.\n\nThe Darwinian code, present\u00aded as an outgrowth of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, accepts cruelty, lust, deceit, cowardice and selfishness as in\u00adtrinsic \u201cvirtues\u201d but disapproves their abuse, he said.\n\nThis idea, not original withDr. Holmes, was developed into a social philosophy called \u201cso\u00adcial Darwinism,\u201d which had a certain vogue in Nazi Germany and other countries but which later fell into disrepute.\n\nThis public image tended to obscure the fact that he was one of the world's foremost au\u00adthorities on zoology and genetics, internationally known for his studies of animal hered\u00adity and behavior. He was one of the first scientists to recognize that radiation could create monsters.\n\nDr. Holmes was born in Henry, Ill. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in science at the University of California and his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Chicago in 1897. After a year of teaching in the public schools of California, Dr. Holmes was an instructor in zoology for six years at the University of Mich\u00adigan.\n\nHe then transferred to the University of Wisconsin, where he remained until 1912, when he went to California as an asso\u00adciate professor. He became pro\u00adfessor in 1917. Dr. Holmes taught at California, and also at the Marine Biological Labor\u00adatory at Wood's Hole, until his retirement in 1939.\n\nHe married Cecelia WarfieldSkinner in 1909. They had five children, Samuel J., Marion V., Avis C., John W. and Joseph E. Holmes.\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form.

Faces light up, figuratively and literally, when the oval begins to glow \u2014 first blue, then varying shades of purple-pink \u2014 as a sitter swings to and fro.\n\n\u201cSwing Time,\u201d which in its finished form consists of 20 glowing oval swings in three different sizes, is the first interactive art piece to be added to the Lawn on D. Commissioned by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, the glowing swing set contains LED lights that activate based on the swings\u2019 movement. An internal accelerometer measures speeds, which signal the color changes.\n\nThe swing set is part of the MCCA\u2019s initiative to create the first interactive public space in Boston. \u201cWe wanted to have a piece that would entice anyone to use it, not just stop and stare,\u201d said Jim Rooney, executive director of the MCCA.\n\nPart playground implement, part art installation, \u201cSwing Time\u201d was designed by Eric Howeler and Meejin Yoon of the Boston firm Howeler and Yoon Architecture. The husband-and-wife team has designed several art pieces meant to activate public spaces, including the award-winning \u201cWhite Noise/White Light\u201d field at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.\n\nHoweler, also an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said he wanted to blend the ideas of a responsive environment and a play space to \u201cSwing Time,\u201d in order to entice park goers to physically interact with it.\n\n\u201cThe stuff between buildings is often left to happenstance, and one of the best ways to bring life to the public realm is through art pieces like this one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stop playing at a certain age. And we were tasked with figuring out how to get everyone, including adults, to play.\u201d\n\nThe swing set joins several activities already dispersed across the 2.7-acre green space. The WiFi-equipped park offers bocce ball, corn hole, and other yard games, as well as an open-air bar Thursday through Sunday. The space hosts music events, and serves as a reception area for events at the BCEC.\n\nRooney hopes that the many organizations and visitors who make their way to the waterfront for conventions, family outings, and the like will take advantage of the Lawn, designated as an experimental event space. \u201cWe want the space to be reflective of the innovative people who live and visit Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd especially this new community that the park resides in\u201d \u2014 Boston\u2019s new innovation district.\n\nJustin Saglio for The Boston Globe\n\nAnna Kaertner at \u201cSwing Time.\u201d\n\nHoweler said he is happy that the MCCA sought to unite Boston\u2019s creative and technology cultures. \u201cBoston has the (Institute of Contemporary Art) and MIT and so many other institutions that are really shaping the world and the space within it in creative new ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such a historic city, but it also has this techy-geeky side that could visually shine through.\u201d\n\nBlending the Lawn\u2019s landscape and atmosphere into \u201cSwing Time\u201d was a pivotal design component, Howeler said. Planning and constructing the piece was a robust process, requiring input from structural engineers, electrical engineers, and computer programmers to prepare it for installation.\n\n\u201cWe bring the whimsical aspect with the technological components of the piece, but that was also the work that was truly meticulous and important to get right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to help create a community here, so those details are the ones that need to shine through.\u201d And in the case of \u201cSwing Time,\u201d those details emit a purple glow.",

        "text": "You\u2019re one of the last charter Team Obama guys still on the job. What\u2019s keeping you around?\n\nI never set out to work in the White House. What drew me to the campaign was really the opportunity to work for Barack Obama. I don\u2019t necessarily see this as a situation where I\u2019m going to be going through the revolving door, in and out of administrations. I happen to have found somebody who I really love to work for, who I have a really good relationship with, and it\u2019s hard to walk away from that.\n\nDo you ever feel envious of friends you started with, who\u2019re out now and setting their hours?\n\nAnybody who leaves here, you see them a couple months later and they look a lot better. They look 20 pounds lighter and five years younger. So it does give you some envy, because you see the physical toll the job takes on you. You see everybody moving, some in Washington, some out to California, and you realize there are many green pastures out there. I still come to work in a windowless office in the basement of the White House. But the other side of the coin is that there\u2019s no other job like this. When you walk out that door for the last time here, you realize your ability to be at the center of events and decision-making on momentous things that are changing the course of history, that goes away. It cuts both ways.\n\nYou had a choice when you entered public life between this and pursuing a career as an author. Is that still the plan when you leave?\n\nI had originally been looking at writing, including fiction. When I leave here, I would certainly want to do my own writing, but more in the non-fiction realm \u2014 books, long-form journalism, and related opportunities. So I haven\u2019t given it much thought beyond that. But after writing for somebody else for so many years, it will be interesting to pivot back to doing things in my own voice.\n\nWhat advice would you give to somebody who wants to follow your path, about the most relevant experience you had to land you this job?\n\nPeople make a mistake when they think that if you just accumulate a set number of things on your resume, it\u2019s going to lead you to a particular place \u2014 the pattern of essentially compiling credentials to climb your way up a ladder. That may work, but that\u2019s not at all what happened to me. I found people I really wanted to work for; I made myself available to do whatever I could with the skills I had; I took some risk, packing up and moving to Chicago; and I looked for the opportunities that fit for me. So I think the biggest advice is to find people you love to work for who you\u2019re going to learn from.\n\nYou and the President obviously spend a lot of time together. Do you have any travel rituals? What do you do on the plane?\n\nHe\u2019s a card player, I\u2019m not. But I\u2019ve gone on all of his foreign trips. We\u2019ll have very intense schedules. One ritual is he likes to find little pockets of down time in the day to just unwind, talk about other things, to be relaxed. But the one ritual that\u2019s always the case is that on speeches, he works very late, so he\u2019ll constantly be making line edits and fiddling with text up until the last minute. So you get a lot of late nights, especially on the big speeches. So you have to kind of pace yourself with the expectation you\u2019re not going to get a lot of sleep, that you\u2019ve got to find ways to relax over the course of the day and that you need to have a reserve of mental energy that you can draw from. That\u2019s the rhythm that you get into on these foreign trips that can be quite a grind.\n\nWhen you\u2019re actually in the White House, how long is your typical day? Can you characterize it?\n\nI\u2019ll get in around 8 and get an intelligence briefing at the beginning of the day, and then go into a series of morning meetings that are about figuring out what we need in place for that day. The afternoons tend to be meetings or work on what policies are running through a process, what are the next big things we\u2019re getting ready for, the next big trip, the next big speech, the next big rollout of a policy. And I\u2019ll tend to be at work from 8 to 8. But the thing about this job, it\u2019s not so much the hours in the office\u2014it\u2019s that you\u2019re always on call. So you\u2019ll end up having to answer email and do things up until you go to bed at 12 or 1 in the morning. So even when you\u2019re home, you\u2019re still working. That\u2019s particularly true in foreign policy. The other day, when we launched airstrikes in Syria, we obviously knew that was going to happen, but that happens overnight, so you basically end up being up all night. You don\u2019t get to control the timing of when things happen in foreign policy like you do in other areas. If something happens in North Korea, or the Middle East or Ukraine, you have to respond to it no matter what time of day it is. So it ends up making you essentially on call 24 hours a day.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important speech you\u2019ve worked on so far? I\u2019m wondering where the UN speech ranks.\n\nThe UN speech is definitely one of the most important, because it\u2019s intended to set the tone for the next year or so going forward, here in the United States but also globally. It\u2019s the roadmap for we\u2019re doing, where we\u2019re trying to go, what we expect of others. There have been a handful of speeches like that. The Cairo speech in 2009, in some ways the Nobel speech he gave, which in some ways was a window into his view of the world that endures well. They break through in a way because they\u2019re bigger than the precise moment we\u2019re in. They\u2019re about laying down markers for what\u2019s going to define the U.S. role in the world for a period of time to come.\n\nBen Rhodes, left with President Obama and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough on Air Force OnePhoto: Pete Souza\u2014The White House/Getty Images\n\nDid you revisit the Cairo and Nobel speeches in writing this one? How\u2019d they inform it?\n\nI actually find the two things I always try to do before working on a big speech are to go back and read relevant speeches by President Obama and by other presidents. It\u2019s interesting to see how other presidents deal with similar moments in time. How did other Presidents speak at the UN at times of significant international turmoil or the beginning of a military action? For President Obama, I often try to go back and look at the foundational speeches. So, what did we say at the UN in previous years? What\u2019s in Cairo speech, what\u2019s in the Nobel speech, even going back to the campaign. And you try to find a thread you can pull forward and update. Even sometimes there\u2019s specific language that you seek to use again to make sure there\u2019s a thread of consistency to the message.\n\nAre there speeches by other presidents you referenced specifically for his latest UN address?\n\nI looked at the 1961 speech to the General Assembly by John F. Kennedy, and I actually ended up putting a quote from that speech in this one. There, too, the theme was essentially a world at a crossroads and having to make a choice between different paths. And so that ended up impacting how we framed this speech. We looked at others, too, and it\u2019s interesting to see how different presidents make use of that particular world stage.\n\nLooking past the current military campaign, how hopeful are you about a lasting peace, in whatever way you want to define that, presiding in the Middle East in the mid- to long-term? Some people are seeing nothing less than a civilizational collapse that\u2019s not fixable in our lifetimes.\n\nThe reason I have to optimistic is that it\u2019s the one thing everybody in the region seems to agree on\u2013that this is such a shocking organization that it\u2019s stirred people out of complacency and opened the doors to alliances that weren\u2019t previously possible. We had the Iraqi prime minister in a meeting with the five Arab nations in our coalition, who have Sunni-led governments. That would not have been thinkable even six months ago. If everybody maintains the current sense of urgency, you can see a pathway for this group to be steadily eroded, but also something better taking its place in terms of a new approach to regional stability. And the other thing I\u2019d say is we can fall into a trap of making these groups and threats out to be more resilient than they really are. With Al Qaeda, we\u2019ve shown that if we just keep the pressure on and have a consensus against an organization, the organization in Afghanistan and Pakistan for intents and purposes is at best a shadow of its former self. The challenge is now doing that in the heart of the Middle East with this group and other extremist satellite. But part of the reason the President gave the speech that he gave is to make clear this can\u2019t just be us launching a bunch of airstrikes. This has to be a much broader effort.\n\nMost of our readers would agree with the assessment behind the rebalance to Asia, that economically the center of gravity in the world is shifting there. It also seems unavoidable with ISIS, and Israel, and Ukraine, and Ebola, that your focus is directed elsewhere right now. How do you deal with that?\n\nYou have to be very disciplined to make sure that even as you\u2019re working the urgent issues, you\u2019re not neglecting what I\u2019d say are the opportunity pieces of your agenda. And the rebalance to Asia is certainly part of that. So for instance, when I went up to the UN with the President, even as we had to work on the speech and all the elements of the coalition building, I carved out two hours for a meeting with the presidential advisor from Burma to talk about the President\u2019s upcoming trip there. It would have been easier to just scrap something like that and focus on ISIL. But you have to be disciplined and remember that you have to focus on the opportunities in the world and not just the threats. The fact is in the long run those may end up making a bigger difference, because there you can make progress and you can build new ways of doing things. The key to it is looking at your schedule at the beginning of the week, and saying to yourself, As easy as it would be to only do the Middle East this week, I have to set aside some time for Africa, for Asia, for Latin America\u2014which we generally define as the opportunity regions\u2014and be sure we\u2019re hitting our marks on them.\n\nYou\u2019re part of the first brother team to make this list. What was your dynamic with [older brother David, president of CBS News] growing up? Did you argue politics over the dinner table?\n\nWe always got along very well. We definitely had different political perspectives. But in my family we were encouraged to argue about everything over the dinner table. And I think since then, we\u2019ve never been competitive, in part because we\u2019re in different fields. He\u2019s in media, I\u2019m in politics and foreign policy and that makes it easier for us to root for each other without competing in the same territory.\n\nDoes knowing him make you more or less cynical about media?\n\nSeeing his perspective about what people are interested in over the years definitely helped me understand that the media is in a high pressure business of their own and they have to find ways in a crowded information environment to report the news in a way that gets peoples attention. It gives me an understanding of the dynamic on the other end of the phone when I\u2019m talking to a reporter, which I have to do a fair amount of.\n\nThis story is from the October 27, 2014 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 In August 2013, transgender television personality B. Scott filed a suit against Black Entertainment Television and its parent company Viacom Inc., claiming that the network had discriminated against him based on his gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from Scott\u2019s appearance as a style correspondent at the 2013 BET awards preshow. After his first segment of the night, in which he appeared with heavy makeup and heels, the network told him to tone down his look and change into masculine clothing that was \u201cdifferent from the androgynous style he\u2019s used to \u2026 and comfortable with,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nA Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided the case Wednesday, and it came down to the First Amendment; not Scott\u2019s freedom to speech and expression, but Viacom\u2019s VIA . The court found that BET\u2019s decision as to how Scott would appear on camera was part of the network\u2019s creative process of developing and broadcasting the show, which is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nMORE: Americans have fallen in love with real estate once again\n\nThe case is by no means the first in which a media company has used the First Amendment as a defense against lawsuits alleging discrimination. The order on Thursday cites several other instances.\n\nThere was the racial discrimination case against ABC for its failure to feature non-white contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. A federal district court in Tennessee dismissed the matter after finding that \u201ccasting decisions are a necessary component of any entertainment show\u2019s creative content.\u201d The court said that \u201cthe plaintiffs seek to drive an artificial wedge between casting decisions and the end product, which itself is indisputably protected as speech by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nAnd there was the lawsuit filed against Warner Bros. by a former writers\u2019 assistant for the television show Friends who asserted that the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language and conduct by the show\u2019s writers constituted sexual harassment. The Supreme Court of California in that case held that \u201cthe First Amendment protects creativity.\u201d\n\nThe case that held greatest precedent is a matter in which a group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual Irish Americans sought to participate in Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. The U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately heard the case, ruled that it would be a violation of the First Amendment for Massachusetts to require private citizens \u201cwho organize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey.\u201d\n\nThe defendants in these cases argued that they didn\u2019t care what their employees or participants are in reality \u2014 gay, straight, male, female \u2014 but rather how they appear. \u201cThey say, \u2018We are entitled to create a program that looks the way we want it to look,\u2019\u201d says Eugene Volokh, a professor at UCLA School of Law. And the courts have agreed with them.\n\nMORE: The market for marketing software is accelerating rapidly\n\nReporting the news and creating a television show both qualify as exercises of free speech, according to Thursday\u2019s ruling in the Scott case. Outside those realms, however, the First Amendment defense against discrimination claims doesn\u2019t work as well. Abercrombie & Fitch anf , for instance, lost a bias suit filed by a Muslim employee that it fired because she refused to remove her head scarf. Abercrombie had argued that any deviation from its dress code threatened the company\u2019s success and that the lawsuit violated its First Amendment right to commercial free speech. A federal judge in California disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment line is really drawn at news and entertainment,\u201d Volokh says. The Supreme Court has found that \u201cpeople who make visual imagery are allowed to control what\u2019s in it.\u201d",

        "text": "Six Egyptians \u2013 possibly attendants of the Victorian photographer Francis Bedford and his companions \u2013 are arranged in a receding zigzag across the rough, uneven floor, dwarfed by walls, pillars and doorjambs in an austere, finely detailed 1862 image of the Ptolemaic Temple of Horus. Bedford must have insisted on between 10 and 12 seconds of complete stillness from the human figures in this majestic work, fully consonant with the 19th-century vogue for the timeless, immovable east \u2013 except for one deliberate anachronism. Between two of the pillars stands a white canvas hut. Here is Bedford\u2019s portable darkroom, scene of minute struggles with the collodion process for making glass negatives. Thus an art form barely 20 years old breaks the repose of Ozymandias.\n\nThe photograph is one of around 190 that Bedford took when he accompanied the 20-year-old Prince of Wales, Albert Edward (\u201cBertie\u201d), on a four-month tour of the Middle East in 1862, and which entered the Royal Collection after his return. They are currently on display at the Queen\u2019s Gallery in London, in a handsome exhibition that does not, however, fully explore all the possibilities of its subject.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, as we are not told in the Queen\u2019s Gallery, was under a cloud. The previous summer he had been initiated into the pleasures of the flesh by an Irish girl named Nellie, and it was from such beginnings that his scandalised father, Prince Albert, hit on the idea of an improving tour of the Ottoman dominions, focusing on the Holy Lands. But Albert had since died, his decline accelerated by his son\u2019s \u201cfall\u201d, and this made Bertie doubly odious to the grief-stricken Queen, who insisted that the trip go ahead while she plotted to marry him off. The prince, enjoying a gentle degree at Cambridge, and evincing no wanderlust, was powerless to resist.\n\nSetting off from Venice in February 1862, the smallish royal party (the principals consisted of Bertie, his governor, General Robert Bruce, and a handful of other, carefully selected, male companions) steamed down the Dalmatian coast and crossed the Mediterranean to Alexandria. From Egypt they went on to explore Palestine and Syria, living in tents and escorted by Ottoman cavalrymen, before sailing back to Europe via Constantinople. The trip took four and a half months, with Bedford as official photographer. His task was to immortalise scenes that were, as the Photographic News put it, \u201cfraught with historic and sacred associations\u201d.\n\nBedford was an experienced architectural and topographical photographer, with royal commissions already behind him, and he fulfilled his brief brilliantly. His harmonious, granular studies of the Egyptian temples and the Roman ruins at Baalbek, in Lebanon, accentuate the neglected, yet romantic, character of these places, with locals used for scale or foreground interest but offering no serious counterweight to the ruins among which they graze their goats or (in the case of Coptic Christians, appropriating part of a Pharoanic complex) come to pray.\n\nThe biblical sites as depicted by Bedford seem virtually unchanged since the Saviour\u2019s time. His Sea of Galilee, for instance, shimmers softly in a landscape that is empty but for the ruins of Tiberias \u2013 where the royal party took Easter communion. And there is little in his image of Jerusalem from Mount of Olives to suggest that these are not the very trees among which Jesus wept the night before his crucifixion.\n\nIt would have been helpful, in the sumptuously illustrated catalogue by Sophie Gordon, to have learned more about the religious importance of these places, which is so vividly evoked in contemporary pilgrims\u2019 accounts. Among these accounts are the entertaining letters of the liberal churchman Arthur Stanley, who was on the tour as Bertie\u2019s spiritual chaperone.\n\nArtists and even photographers had trodden the same paths before (the Englishman Francis Frith as recently as 1860), but each year, as the photo-historian Badr El Hage notes in his useful catalogue essay, brought more pilgrims, scholars and diplomats to a region that had seen few westerners since the Crusades. Passenger steamships (P&O began plying the eastern Mediterranean in 1835), guidebooks and the first Thomas Cook package tour gave notice of a harder, more permanent intrusion, with western museums filling up with Mediterranean fragments, the great powers using their concern for the Holy Places and religious minorities as a pretext for elbowing into Ottoman affairs, and, already, those mellow voids inspiring thoughts of a Jewish state.\n\nThe Tsar\u2019s brother had made his tearful pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre three years before, the Russian foreign ministry minuting that \u201cJerusalem is the centre of the world and our mission must be there\u201d. The British and French felt the same.\n\nOf the historical aspects of the itinerary, the Prince of Wales was indefatigably ignorant \u2013 as we know from Arthur Stanley, who felt affection for his boyish, good-humoured charge, but there was no denying that the young man was less moved by the scene of Elijah\u2019s sacrifice on Mount Carmel than the prospect of shooting quail on the same slopes, and if he wasn\u2019t complaining about all the \u201ctumbledown\u201d temples, he spent his time testing his travel companions on the plot of a recent potboiler.\n\nBertie was a keen souvenir hunter, acquiring, among other things, a mummy whose excavation he had witnessed, a papyrus funerary text and a beautiful scarab made of glazed, blue-green soapstone, which he had mounted on tiny gold python heads, as a brooch. (Except for the mummy, which has disappeared, these objects have been included in the exhibition.)\n\nFor the more thoughtful members of the party, there were considerable advantages to be gained from travelling with the heir to a quarter of the globe, not least permissions to visit the sepulchre of the Patriarchs at Hebron, hitherto inaccessible to Christians, and Jerusalem\u2019s Dome of the Rock, whose dilapidated dignity (it has since been lavishly restored) Bedford was one of the earliest photographers to record. \u201cThe prince entered the mosque,\u201d crowed the Illustrated London News, \u201cstanding where no infidel has stood since the Crusades.\u201d In Jerusalem, Bertie was tattooed with the Crusaders\u2019 Jerusalem Cross on his forearm.\n\nAlong with the great Umayyad Mosque at Damascus, also somewhat shabby through Bedford\u2019s lens, the Dome of the Rock is one of the few subjects that look better now than a century and a half ago. The pyramids have been all but consumed by Cairo\u2019s sprawl, and the then-sleepy Lebanese port of Tripoli, also photographed by Bedford, by Sunni-Shia conflict.\n\nReligious bloodshed was indeed a theme of the later stages of the tour, from visits to Crusader castles to the aftermath of a rankling three-way enmity between Christians, Sunnis and Druze. In 1860, Druze bands had laid waste to hundreds of Christian settlements in Lebanon \u2013 including the village of Hasbiya, which Bedford photographed. Most affecting, however, are his images of Christian Damascus, annihilated in the same year, with the buildings reduced to carcasses and not a soul in sight. Also in Damascus, Bedford made a rare portrait of an exiled Algerian nationalist leader who had given Christians sanctuary in his home.\n\nNowadays it is tempting to see communal conflict as endemic in the Levant and Mesopotamia, but the pogroms, whose effects the royal party witnessed had been notably rare until the 1840s. Bertie waxed indignant at Ottoman misrule, but Europe\u2019s sponsorship of local clients (for years Britain had supported the Druze, while the French backed the Maronites) had helped upset the old religious balances in the first place, foreshowing the cataclysmic communal violence of the final decades of the Ottoman empire.\n\nEven the cheapness of English cloth had sharpened resentments between the various groups, enriching the Christian agents of the Manchester houses and impoverishing Muslim weavers \u2013 unintended consequences of the Industrial Revolution and globalisation.\n\nIn June 1862, the tourists went their separate ways \u2013 Stanley nursing a mix of pilgrim\u2019s joy and filial sadness, for his mother had died in his absence, and Bruce a violent fever that would quickly kill him. Bedford got to work printing and exhibiting; his technique was commended by the cognoscenti and his images snapped up by the pious. As Gordon\u2019s biographical essay tells us, he went on to become a much-respected (and wealthy) photographer, and left \u201can extraordinary photographic legacy, much of which remains to be discovered\u201d.\n\nQueen Victoria found Bertie \u201cmuch improved\u201d by his travels, and \u201cready to do everything as I wish\u201d. Stanley was less sanguine, writing of \u201cthe difficulty of producing any impression on a mind with no previous knowledge or interest to be awakened\u201d. For all that, seven years later the prince would be drawn back to the Holy Land, this time in the company of his wife, the former Princess Alexandra of Denmark \u2013 and the recipient, as it turned out, of that beautiful, blue-green, python-mounted scarab.\n\n\u2022 Cairo to Constantinople: Early Photographs of the Middle East is at the Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London SW1A, until 22 February",

        "text": "October 11 is National Coming Out Day in the United States, and it's widely celebrated in America's LGBTQ community as an opportunity to share individual coming-out stories as well as to reflect on social gains.\n\nBut in more than 70 countries around the world, coming out isn't always worth celebrating (yet). In the nations that criminalize LGBTQ people, coming out\u2014or being forcibly outed\u2014can result in banishment, jail or even death. T\u00e9a Braun, Legal Director at the Human Dignity Trust, said Coming Out Day stands as a reminder that there's still a long way to go.\n\n\"Coming out is still a life and death question in many places around the world,\" Braun told NBC OUT. \"LGBT people continue to be arrested, prosecuted, lashed, raped, forced or coerced into straight marriages, assaulted and murdered if their identity is known or suspected.\"\n\nAfter the 2015 Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S. and a string of federal policy changes that have made schools and healthcare providers more LGBTQ-inclusive, some Americans may feel as if the battle has been won. But in countries like Uganda, the past few years\u2014with increasing LGBTQ visibility and trends toward acceptance worldwide\u2014have been worse than ever.\n\nAn April 2016 report published by Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) showed that violent crimes and police and government harassment against the LGBTQ community increased after the country passed a vicious Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2014. The law has since been overturned by a court, but its intended consequences (life imprisonment for gay sex) have increased stigmatization of Uganda's LGBTQ community.\n\nBraun said that international policy is trending toward LGBTQ equality, with Belize, Seychelles, Mozambique, Nauru and Palau recently decriminalizing homosexuality. But as a smattering of nations slowly drop laws that send LGBTQ people to jail or death row, the situation remains dire for many elsewhere.\n\nComing out is particularly risky in Islamic nations in the Middle East, where the majority of countries either have laws on the books that punish homosexuality with the death penalty (whether or not the penalty is enforced), or where executions frequently occur despite no specific law mandating them. According to the International Lesbian and Gay Association's (ILGA) 2016 report State-Sponsored Homophobia, those nations include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Daesh/the Islamic State (which is not recognized as a country).\n\nThere's a certain Catch-22, though, to visibility and coming out in countries that criminalize LGBTQ populations.\n\n\"Visibility is key for the advancement of LGBTI human rights,\" ILGA Executive Director Renato Sabbadini told NBC OUT via email. \"Most people are more likely to understand the discrimination LGBTI people face and empathise with them if they realize that the LGBTI acronym is used not to refer to an empty abstraction\u2014but to identify a set of real people, including their children, relatives, friends or colleagues.\"\n\nSabbadini was referring specifically to the findings of ILGA's Global Attitudes Survey on LGBTI People, conducted in partnership with the television network LOGO. The 2016 survey found that 34 percent of respondents had become more accepting of LGBTQ people in the past five years, reporting that their favorable attitude shifts were a direct result of knowing an LGBTQ person. The numbers show that just by being out, an LGBTQ person can instigate social change starting with their own communities.\n\nBut even when being LGBTQ isn't punishable by death or life imprisonment at the hands of your government, it's not always safe to be out. Stan Ibrahim is a Kuwaiti transgender man who publishes the world's only Arabic-language transgender magazine. He shared his own coming-out story with NBC OUT, explaining that while being LGBTQ can get you sent to jail in Kuwait, \"at least you won't be killed or beheaded.\"\n\n\"I thought that being a transsexual is to have a mental illness that will go away after going to a psychologist,\" Ibrahim wrote in English in a direct Twitter message on Tuesday. He said he started to come out as transgender at age 14, and his parents were shocked\u2014insisting that it is a phase that will end by the time he graduates college later this year.\n\nIn the U.S., the transgender community struggled for years to not be seen as mentally ill. The removal of Gender Identity Disorder from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 was celebrated as a step toward destigmatizing the community. But in Kuwait, as in many Middle Eastern countries, transgender people are struggling to have gender difference accepted as a mental health status\u2014because then, at least, it might be treated as a fixed human condition rather than as a depraved choice.\n\nKuwait currently criminalizes transgender people under a 2007 law that bans \"imitating the opposite sex.\" Ironically, the law makes no provision for Gender Identity Disorder\u2014a medical condition recognized by the country's Ministry of Health. As a result, according to Human Rights Watch, transgender women in particular are arrested and abused by police on a regular basis.\n\nApart from the frequent arrests, Ibrahim said that being LGBTQ in Kuwait is marked by constant bullying, harassment, and mockery from family and peers.\n\n\"[My father is] driving me to college every day, and every day he mocks my hair and my dress,\" Ibrahim said. \"So he is my number one bully.\"\n\n\"Religious families take their LGBT children to a cleric or sheikh. And of course they'll be punished, they'll face a lot of physical violence,\" Ibrahim explained. \"Parents won't let their daughters and sons become your friend. And if anyone saw you hanging out as queer or LGBT, they have the right to litigate you. And the law stands by them.\"\n\nDespite the hardships, though, Ibrahim told NBC OUT he's glad he came out\u2014even if it meant potentially risking his family, friends and even his life.\n\n\"Staying closeted is worse,\" Ibrahim said. \"You'll hate yourself and you'll be ashamed of who you are. I don't accept being marginalized.\"\n\nFollow NBC OUT on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.",

They\u2019ve spent the last decade in court trying to get it back.\n\nThe Bakers built the voice recognition software company Dragon Systems from scratch and eventually sold it for $580 million to a Dutch company, Lernout & Hauspie, in 2000. Just two months later, news accounts detailed bogus international sales that had boosted the buyer\u2019s financial statements. Soon, the entire business collapsed in a bankrupt heap.\n\nThe Bakers, who took their $300 million share of proceeds entirely in Lernout & Hauspie stock, lost everything when the company failed.\n\nEver since, the couple and others have sued everyone in sight: accountants, commercial bankers who did business with Lernout & Hauspie and the Dutch company\u2019s investment banker. They\u2019ve recovered about $70 million settling those lawsuits.\n\nNow a jury is about to hear the Bakers\u2019 last big case \u2014 perhaps their biggest \u2014 against the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Jury selection is scheduled to start Monday in US District Court in Boston for a trial expected to last about five weeks.\n\nThe complaint in a nutshell: You should have figured out those guys were crooks.\n\nGoldman acted as the adviser to Dragon Systems in its merger negotiations and \u2014 by the Bakers\u2019 account \u2014 did a stunningly bad job. Alan Cotler, a Philadelphia lawyer representing the Bakers, says the couple \u2014 true pioneers in voice recognition technology \u2014 lost more than just money.\n\n\u201cJim and Janet Baker spent about 25 years of their lives creating Dragon to realize their dream of having millions of people use computers and other devices that understand human speech,\u201d says Cotler, who was in Boston Thursday preparing for the trial.\n\n\u201cGoldman Sachs played a fundamental role in the Bakers losing all that,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, speech recognition is being used throughout the world, and its best and most productive applications are still to come.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs you would expect, the investment bank doesn\u2019t see it that way. Goldman says it \u201cperformed its assignment satisfactorily in all respects.\u201d It said the Baker claims \u201care completely without merit.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know who has the better legal case, and the Bakers certainly made some odd, regrettable decisions along the way. But their Wall Street advisers fell far short in advising Dragon Systems on a sale to a buyer that newspaper reports uncovered as a fraud just months after closing (The Wall Street Journal simply called purported L&H customers and discovered they weren\u2019t doing business with the company).\n\nSurely no one familiar with Dragon Systems in its earliest days could have ever imagined how the story would unfold.\n\nThe Bakers were serious technology professionals who became bootstrap entrepreneurs in the 1980s, building a company around their voice recognition technology without the help of venture capitalists. Later, when they needed money to grow a successful business, they sold stock to disk drive maker Seagate Technology.\n\nIn fact, voice recognition was starting to attract the attention of much bigger technology companies. As the 1990s came to an end, conversation at Dragon Systems shifted from selling shares to selling the company.\n\nThe company hired Goldman in December of 1999 as an adviser. The transaction was small potatoes for Goldman, worth $5 million in fees. But it was the deal of a lifetime for the Bakers, and it went south in a hurry.\n\nI don\u2019t know why Dragon Systems\u2019 directors didn\u2019t get a formal fairness opinion about the sale proposal from Goldman \u2014 a point the investment bankers raise in their legal defense. I also don\u2019t know if it would have mattered.\n\nHanded a pile of stock, I can\u2019t explain why the sellers didn\u2019t use common financial strategies to hedge some of the risk. The Bakers still would have lost control of their technology, but much or all of their fortune might have been preserved.\n\nThe voice recognition technology acquired by Lernout & Hauspie was sold with other \u00adassets in bankruptcy. Today, it is owned by Nuance Communications Inc. of Burlington, which sells a line of software products bearing the Dragon name.\n\nIt took Dragon Systems years to get its groundbreaking technology to market. It\u2019s taking almost as long to sort out responsibility for the company\u2019s disastrous end.",

        "text": "Zsuzsi Roboz, who has died aged 82, was an artist with a gift for portraiture. Though she never regarded herself as being primarily a portrait painter, posterity will undoubtedly be grateful to her for her interest in portraying leading creative personalities of her time. These included figures from the worlds of dance, theatre, literature and music \u2013 she made a striking likeness of the conductor Sir Georg Solti, though she complained that he never took his nose out of a score that he was reading in preparation for an upcoming performance.\n\nHer 2011 series, Face to Face, was devoted to notable British and Irish writers, among them personalities as different from one another as Anita Brookner, Tom Stoppard, Seamus Heaney and PD James. She always tried to give these likenesses something that went further than simple realism. Essentially she was a symbolist artist \u2013 she wanted to catch the creative aura of those she portrayed, many of whom have not otherwise been the subjects of penetrating works of art of this sort.\n\nZsuzsi's beginnings were prosperous. She was born in Budapest, where her father, Imre Roboz, was the manager of the V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z theatre, which specialised in operetta in a city that particularly relished this form of entertainment. Her mother was a society hostess. Budapest was largely unscathed during the early years of the second world war, when Hungary had prudently, if reluctantly, taken the side of the Axis.\n\nFor most of the war years, the Roboz family lived a relatively unthreatened existence. But as the Russian army approached, Germany staged a coup and replaced the Hungarian government, and things then changed drastically. Budapest was besieged and Zsuzsi's father disappeared, killed, as her family later discovered, by the invading Russians.\n\nZsuzsi, her mother and a French lodger were sheltered by neighbours and eventually made a dramatic escape under gunfire across the melting ice of the Danube, and found their way to the safety of the allies.\n\nAfter a brief period in France, Zsuzsi was sent to secretarial school in London. There she soon made her way into the employ of the Hungarian film mogul Alexander Korda, who had been a friend of her father's at school. The real turning point in her life, however, came when she met the Italian painter Pietro Annigoni at one of his exhibitions in London. He was attracted by her charmingly gamine appearance, and she, no doubt, by the force of his personality. In 1954 she moved to Italy and spent a year in his studio class, returning to London equipped with skills as a draughtswoman.\n\nOne of her first commissions was to make drawings of what went on behind the scenes at the Windmill theatre, then in its last days of presenting nude revues. Throughout her career she was interested in portraying musicians and dancers, often in moments when they were at their most relaxed, and least conscious of the presence of a spectator.\n\nShe was part of a lively London bohemian scene. She made a brief marriage, in 1953, to an illustrator, Ley Kenyon, who made the mistake of thinking that she would be entirely obedient to his wishes. He discovered his mistake, as she later gleefully recalled, one night when he came home late from the pub. He went to the bathroom, and Zsuzsi, who had already packed her bags, locked him in and departed. They divorced, but in later years remained on reasonably friendly terms. Kenyon later became Jacques Cousteau's assistant.\n\nHer second marriage, in 1964, to the property developer Teddy Smith was a different matter. He admired what she did and was eager to encourage her talent. The fact that he was a patron of the recently founded Chichester Festival theatre gave her access to luminaries of the British stage. In 1972 she was commissioned to make a series of portraits celebrating 10 years of the enterprise. Her portrait drawing of Leslie Evershed-Martin, who founded the theatre, is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, as is her likeness of Dame Ninette de Valois, evidence of her continuing interest in the world of dance and dancers.\n\nAfter Smith's death, Zsuzsi lived quietly in Mayfair. She also had a small studio in Pimlico. Her chief way of entertaining was through a half-share in a grand-tier box at the Royal Albert Hall, which she used chiefly for the Proms. She particularly loved the late Romantic composers, such as Mahler. She also loved Bart\u00f3k, who was part of a Hungarian identity that Zsuzsi never completely abandoned. Her British friends used to joke that it was fatal to go with her to any gathering where there were Hungarian-speakers, as she immediately lapsed into that difficult but fascinating language, and left her companion stranded.\n\nShe is survived by Anthony, a stepson from her second marriage.\n\n\u2022 Zsuzsi (Suzanne) Roboz, artist, born 15 August 1929; died 9 July 2012",

        "text": "photos by Josh Reynolds for The Boston Globe\n\nChris Carrabba (left) of Dashboard Confessional and Third Eye Blind lead singer Stephan Jenkins at Blue Hills Bank Pavilion Thursday.\n\nNear the end of his band Dashboard Confessional\u2019s set at the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion on Thursday, singer-guitarist Chris Carrabba explained why his recently reborn anthemic-emo act decided to tour with Third Eye Blind. \u201cWhat do our fans have in common?\u201d he asked. \u201cAll our fans can sing.\u201d (He used a glowing yet unpublishable descriptor to drive the point home.)\n\nThursday\u2019s audience more than proved up to the challenge during the dual-headliner show. But the two bands share much more than chorale-ready devotees. Their hooky pop-rock crunch inspires lighter-raising and high fives; they showcase rapid-fire, brutally frank lyrics that detail the inner workings of the male mind; and most crucially, they share charismatic lead singers, men who know how to work a room even when they\u2019re baring their most brutal emotions.\n\nDashboard Confessional began as a stripped-down side project for Carrabba, who had fronted louder yet still feelings-forward acts like Further Seems Forever. It eventually came to the forefront for him, though, and as the band\u2019s popularity grew with songs like the gasping \u201cScreaming Infidelities\u201d and the intricate \u201cVindicated\u201d (which appeared on the \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d soundtrack), so did its sound, until it broke up in 2010.\n\nThe band\u2019s reunion earlier this year doubled as an opportunity for it to revisit its vast back catalog; Carrabba\u2019s potent voice served as a beacon, while his bandmates turned diaristic bedroom pop into roof-raising anthems. Carrabba was grateful and winking by turns, thanking the audience for sticking by him over the years and tossing off the occasional joke.\n\nThe San Francisco act Third Eye Blind is probably best known for \u201cSemi-Charmed Life,\u201d one of the \u201990s most potent tracks \u2014 thanks to its indelible hook (\u201cdoo doo do, doo da-doo doo\u201d), the existentially hedonistic track will rightfully be enshrined in that decade\u2019s pop time capsule alongside Smash Mouth\u2019s \u201cAll Star\u201d and the Rembrandts\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll Be There for You.\u201d\n\nBut the band\u2019s appeal reaches wider, as evidenced by Thursday night\u2019s throng. Lead singer Stephan Jenkins has a two-by-four voice, a preacher\u2019s charisma, and a startling willingness to lyrically reveal his worst traits; his band\u2019s omnivorous take on pop-rock helps the sourness go down a bit easier. The high-energy set, which included hits like the bubblegummy \u201cNever Let You Go\u201d alongside tracks from a just-released fifth album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d was supposed to end with \u201cLife.\u201d But Jenkins noticed a sign near the front asking for the straightforward album track \u201cGod of Wine,\u201d and he complied. The audience did, too.",

Amazing, eh?\n\nBut the average after-market return (after the first day) has been a DECLINE of 11.3 percent.\n\nTake Castlight Health (CSLT),which went public on March 13. It provides software that helps self-insured employers control healthcare costs. The original price talk was $9-$11, it priced at $16, and the first day closed over $40, up 148 percent. Wow!\n\nIt is now at $13.80, 13 percent below its IPO price.\n\nHuh? The stock is UP 148 percent on its first day, and is now 13 percent below its IPO price?\n\nTake a look at the prices of a few other tech or tech-like companies after their first day of trading:\n\nWhat happened? Two things happened: 1) the overall market uptrend broke in the beginning of April, and 2) the appetite for high-risk/high-growth waned.\n\nIn the case of Castlight, this was one of those cloud companies with no earnings, a subscription model.\n\nHere's another example: Varonis (VRNS), which provides software that manages data security and other data, went public February 27 at $22. It closed over $40 on the first day, up 100 percent.\n\nOK, you say, it's still above its initial price. But, I ask you: if you were an average investor who bought this stock for $40 on the first day, how would you feel about buying more IPOs after seeing this one trading at $26 six weeks later?\n\nAt least there's no tech IPOs coming next week. There's Papa Murphy's (FRSH), a pizza company, but the biggest deal is Ares Asset Management (ARES), an \"alternative\" asset management company. The word \"alternative\" is a phrase meaning \"anything but stocks.\"\n\nSo what's next? Oddly, nothing has jumped on to the calendar recently. The deal calendar is very low. There is silence.\n\nThat's a sign the market is under stress.\n\nHere's how it works: A company announces it has filed to go public. Right now, there are 118 IPOs that have filed to go public, trying to raise $25 billion, according to Renaissance.\n\nThey include companies like Box, Synchrony Financial (consumer lending arm of GE), and JD.com (Chinese online sales platform).\n\nAnd that's just those that are public; there are probably 100 that are in \"confidential\" filings with the SEC that have not been publicly announced yet.\n\nBut there's a big gap between ANNOUNCING you are going public and GOING public.\n\nSome time after announcing it's going public, the company will set terms by announcing a price range for the IPO, then will begin a road show. It tells you it is actively marketing. Then it goes public.\n\nThe time between setting terms and going public is usually about two weeks.\n\nBut suddenly, we don't hear anything from the hot space: Technology.\n\nNot a single tech company has filed for terms since Sabre (SABR) last week.\n\nThat means no tech companies are beginning road shows. Why not? Because they are afraid.\n\nOf course, IPO issuers are still talking up the business. They say, \"Look how many IPOs have been done, you can go too!\"\n\nBut that's a bad way to look at it. When you price below the price talk, or the low end of the price talk, that's a disappointment.\n\nWhen you have the kind of declines we have seen from the first day pops, that's a disappointment.\n\nThis is a good turn of events. We did have froth. This is now taking froth out.\n\nIt will set up for the next round. Some companies may not make it, but most will go public. But they will come at lower prices. Good for investors.\n\nWhat needs to happen? First, we need the stock market to stabilize. Then, we need more stability in the IPO market.\n\nWatch the Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of over 60 IPOs, which is now down 2.8 percent this year, versus a decline of 0.7 percent for the S&P 500. It's down 12 percent since hitting its high in early March. That's where to look for stability.\n\nAnd watch to see if any tech companies announce price terms next week and begin a road show. If we hear nothing\u2014silence\u2014that will be the biggest indicator of all the IPO boom has withered. For the moment.",

        "text": "It begins with a photograph. In 1934 a struggling Hungarian photographer, Andr\u00e9 Friedmann, living in exile in Paris, is commissioned to take publicity pictures for a Swiss life insurance company's advertising brochure. On the lookout for potential models, he approaches a young Swiss refugee, Ruth Cerf, in a caf\u00e9 on the Left Bank and convinces her to pose for him in a Montparnasse park.\n\nBecause she does not entirely trust the scruffy young charmer, Ruth brings along her friend Gerta Pohorylle, a petite redhead with a winning smile and a confident manner. So begins the most iconic relationship in the history of photography, and an intertwined and complex story of radical politics, bohemianism and bravery that, in the intervening years, has taken on the shadings of a modern myth.\n\nTogether, Andr\u00e9 Friedmann and Gerta Pohorylle would change their names and their destiny, becoming Robert Capa and Gerda Taro, the most celebrated visual chroniclers of the Spanish civil war. Together, too, they would change the nature of war photography, reinventing the form in a way that resonates to this day. Capa went on to become the most famous of the two, and arguably the most famous war photographer of the 20th century due to his visceral images of the D-day landings on Omaha Beach in Normandy. His most famous quote would become a dictum by which ensuing generations of war photographers worked: \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\"\n\nThis brave, but cavalier, approach to getting pictures of the action from within the action would cost both Gerda Taro and Robert Capa their lives \u2013 the former killed on the frontline of the Spanish civil war in 1937; the latter blown up by a land mine in Indochina in 1954. The myth of Robert Capa and Gerda Taro continues apace today with the British publication of a novel called Waiting for Robert Capa by Susana Fortes, a Spanish novelist and teacher. The book won the coveted Premio Fernando Lara in Spain on its initial publication in 2009 and has since been translated into 20 languages; the film rights have been bought by Michael Mann, the award-winning director of Heat (1995), The Insider (1999) and Public Enemies (2009). Fortes's short novel is essentially a historical romance that concentrates on the relationship between Capa and Taro. While the historical settings are accurate, Fortes literally puts words into each of their mouths, imagining conversations, thoughts and debates as well as accentuating both the doomed romance and the reckless bohemianism of the times.\n\nWith the Spanish civil war as its main backdrop, the narrative is an uneasy, sometimes awkward, merging of fact and fiction, and will almost certainly offend the many guardians of both Capa and Taro's reputations just as it will no doubt entrance the mainstream cinema-going audience should it be made into a Hollywood film. \"I tried to be very respectful of the facts \u2013 the biographical data, the locations etc,\" says Fortes when I contact her in Spain, where she is on a book publicity tour. \"I went through everything I could find: letters, memories, biographies\u2026 But for a novel to breathe, you have to build souls for your characters. This is reflected in the dialogue, the literary tension, the humour, the fights, the passion, the sex, the mixed feelings. In other words, life. That's part of the novelist's job. One always writes with one foot on the ground and the other in the air. It is the only way to walk the path.\"\n\nHowever, when I mention the book to Jimmy Fox \u2013 veteran photographic historian and erstwhile director of the famous Magnum agency, which Capa co-founded with Henri Cartier-Bresson \u2013 he says: \"I was dismayed by the novel. It was so fluttery and sugary. I think it is wrong to elevate the romance in that way. Capa was a flamboyant guy, a great drinker and a womaniser who had so many lovers, including Ingrid Bergman. Taro found the love of her life in Ted Allan, the man who was with her when she was fatally wounded. But of course that does not fit the big simplified romantic version so neatly.\"\n\nThe independent filmmaker Trisha Ziff, who directed The Mexican Suitcase (2010) about the discovery of a hoard of unseen negatives by Capa, Taro and David \"Chim\" Seymour, concurs. \"Waiting for Robert Capa is a fiction based on a romance, but it is also a romance based on a fiction. If it becomes a Hollywood film, the myth will no doubt take over.\"\n\nIf there is one thing all the experts agree on, it is that nothing was straightforward about Robert Capa and Gerda Taro's relationship. Shortly after their first meeting, the young Andr\u00e9 Friedmann was sent to Spain on an assignment for a Berlin-based photo magazine. He subsequently photographed the Holy Week procession in Seville and described the festivities to Gerta Pohorylle in a letter that also mentioned how much he was thinking about her. On his return, he spent the summer holidaying in the south of France with Gerta and her friends. According to Ruth Cerf, quoted in Alex Kershaw's book Blood and Champagne: The Life and Times of Robert Capa, the pair \"fell in love in the south of France\" despite her suspicion that he was \"a rogue and a womaniser\". If the young Gerta was fascinated by his waywardness, he in turn was taken by her independent spirit. \"Here was a woman,\" writes Kershaw, \"who didn't suffocate him with affection, and who was as unashamed by her sexuality as she was conscious of her outsider status in Paris as a German Jew.\" This gets to the heart of the couple's mutual attraction: their shared radicalism and acute sense of exile. Friedmann had departed his native Hungary for Berlin in 1931 soon after his arrest by the secret police for leftist student activism. In February 1933, aged 19, he had fled Berlin when Hitler assumed power, travelling to Vienna, then back home to Budapest, before departing Hungary for good in September to live in penury in Paris, where he met Pohorylle on that fateful day in 1934.\n\nBy then, she too had experienced radical politics, arrest and flight. Born to bourgeois parents in Stuttgart in 1910, Pohorylle joined a young communist organisation and, around the time Friedmann was fleeing Berlin, was distributing anti-Nazi leaflets and putting up communist propaganda posters on walls under cover of darkness. She was arrested by the Nazis on 19 March 1933 and interrogated about a supposed Bolshevik plot to overthrow Hitler.\n\nOn her release, she used a fake passport to travel overland to Paris, where she was looked after by a communist network. Both Andr\u00e9 Friedmann and Gerta Pohorylle, though still young, were already seasoned activists and exiles when they met, intent on forging new lives for themselves while also staying loyal to their radical leftist roots.\n\nThough Friedmann could seldom afford to buy film and often had to pawn his camera to survive in Paris, he schooled Pohorylle in the rudiments of photography and found her a job in the newly formed Alliance Photo picture agency. And she, it seemed, anchored him \u2013 at least for a while. \"Without Gerta, Andr\u00e9 would not have made it,\" the late Eva Besny\u00f6, another Hungarian photographer who mixed in the same bohemian circles in Berlin, told Kershaw. \"She picked him up, gave him direction. He had never wanted an ordinary life, and so when things didn't go well, he drank and gambled. He was in a bad way when they met, and maybe without her it would have been the end for him.\"\n\nAs Friedmann's photographic career tentatively took off in Paris, his younger brother Cornell joined him, developing the photographs taken by Andr\u00e9 as well as those of his friends, Henri Cartier-Bresson and David \"Chim\" Seymour, in a darkened bathroom in a hotel that overlooked the famous Caf\u00e9 du D\u00f4me. It was there that the three photographers mingled with philosophers, writers and artists, drinking and dreaming of better times. It was around this time also that Andr\u00e9 Friedmann and Gerta Pohorylle became Robert Capa and Gerda Taro in a shared act of self-reinvention that still seems daring today.\n\nThe first anyone else heard of Robert Capa was when the couple turned up at the offices of Alliance Photo and announced they had discovered a famous American photographer of that name. The pair soon found they could sell photographs attributed to the fictitious Capa to French photographic agencies for three times the price of Friedmann's, such was the status accorded visiting American photographers. Their joint ruse was soon discovered, but the pseudonyms remained in place. In her essay for the exhibition catalogue Gerda Taro: Archive, published in 2007, Irme Schaber notes: \"Taro and Capa were not merely reacting to their precarious economic situation. They were responding as well to the antisemitism of Germany and the increasing antipathy towards foreigners in France. And to elude the stigma attached to being refugees, they spurned every ethnic or religious label.\"\n\nIf their joint self-reinvention was the first significant factor in the dramatic trajectory of Robert Capa and Gerda Taro, the second was their decision to go together to Spain in 1936 to cover the republican resistance to Franco's fascist rebels. Like many writers and artists, including George Orwell and Andr\u00e9 Malraux, they went there out of political conviction and scorned any notion of journalistic detachment. The fight against fascism was, in a very real and personal way, their fight, given their history as exiles and refugees, and the Spanish civil war was the literal and metaphorical frontline of that battle.\n\nIt was an adventure, though, that almost ended as soon as it had begun, when the plane hired by the French magazine Vu to take them to Barcelona crash-landed in a field on the outskirts of the city. The pair limped into Barcelona to find scenes of ferment and disorder as anarchist forces took over the city. There, they photographed young republicans leaving Barcelona for the frontlines. Then in September they travelled together to the front themselves, arriving in the village of Cerro Muriano near C\u00f3rdoba, where they found, and photographed, crowds of villagers fleeing their homes as the fascists rained shells down on the village. In one famous series of pictures, Capa captured Taro crouched, camera in hand, behind a wall beside a republican soldier. In another even more famous picture, perhaps the most well-known war photograph ever, Capa caught a militiaman at the very moment of his death from a sniper's bullet.\n\nIn that split second, the legend of Robert Capa, war photographer, was born, and decades later that same image would become the centre of a debate that still simmers over the ethics and veracity of war photography. In Waiting for Robert Capa, Fortes writes: \"Death of a Loyalist Militiaman contained all the drama of Goya's Third of May 1808 painting, all the rage that Guernica would later show\u2026 Its strength, like all symbols, didn't lie in just the image, but in what it was representing.\" Fortes also imagines Taro gently probing Capa for the story of what really happened that day, and him replying: \"We were just fooling around, that's all. Perhaps I complained that everything was far too calm and that there wasn't anything interesting to photograph. Then some of the men started to run down the slope and I joined in as well. We went up and down the hill several times. We were all feeling good. Laughing. They shot in the air. I took several photographs\u2026\"\n\nThough the context of the photograph is still contested, the imagined conversation does describe what probably happened that day just before a Francoist sniper returned fire from across the hills, killing the militiaman who was running down the hill for Capa's camera. \"People want the truth from war photography more than they do from any other kind of photography,\" says Jimmy Fox, the Magnum picture editor who has worked with the likes of Don McCullin and Philip Jones Griffiths, \"but a flat surface of an image is not the reality and never can be.\"\n\nIn Spain, Capa soon developed a reputation for taking photographs whatever the risk, setting the tone for war reportage as we now know it. Taro, too, was often seen running across the battle lines with her camera, her bravery matched by her recklessness. She travelled back and forth to the frontlines, shooting what she saw, often driven by a mixture of humanity, political commitment and a shrewd understanding of the power of the photograph to shape public opinion.\n\nThroughout 1937, Taro visited several frontlines, either with Capa or on her own. They managed to return to Paris for a short vacation in July that year, celebrating Bastille Day by dancing in the streets below Sacre Coeur and, according to Schaber, hatching \"great plans for the future\". Taro then returned to Spain alone, despite the growing concerns of her friends who, having seen her recent photographs of the fighting, feared for her safety.\n\nDefying a ban on journalists travelling to the front, she once again made her way to Brunete with the Canadian journalist Ted Allan, her close friend, travelling companion and soon-to-be lover. According to Allan's diaries, written later, they spent \"mornings afternoons and evenings together chasing stories... For three or four weeks we were constant companions. And finally, one afternoon, we ended up in her hotel room.\" She told Allan: \"Capa is my friend, my copain,\" and said she might be travelling to China with him. \"Nothing was settled,\" wrote Allan. \"Everything was possible.\"\n\nOn Sunday 25July, the pair found themselves trapped in a foxhole near Brunete as bombs fell around them relentlessly. Taro kept on photographing, often holding her camera high above her head to capture the carnage. Allan protected her with a film camera as shrapnel and rocks fell around them. Then, as republican troops began pulling out of the area, Taro and Allan ran out of the foxhole and hitched a ride on the running board of a car while the planes continued to strafe the retreating convoy. In the chaos, the car was then rammed by an out-of-control republican tank and the couple were thrown into the dirt. Transported to a nearby field hospital, Taro died from her injuries in the early hours of the following morning. She was 26. The injured Allan did not get to see her again. According to Irene Golden, the nurse who was on duty, her last words were: \"Did they take care of my camera?\"\n\nGerda Taro's funeral in Paris was attended by tens of thousands of mourners, including Capa, Chim and Ted Allan. Orchestrated by the French communist party, which claimed her as one of its own, it became, as Schaber puts it, \"a spectacular manifestation of international solidarity with the Spanish republic\". In death, Gerda Taro became a hero. Robert Capa went on to become the most celebrated and mythologised war photographer of the century until he, too, died in action in Indochina in 1954 at the age of 40. \"He never talked about her,\" says the photographer Ata Kand\u00f3 in The Mexican Suitcase.\n\nGerda Taro has now fully emerged from the shadow of Capa as an important photographer in her own right. Many photographs attributed to him \u2013 they initially shared the byline CAPA \u2013 have now been identified as hers. \"She was a pioneering woman both as a photographer and a political activist,\" says Ziff. \"She was very liberated for her time, putting her work before any more traditional female role. She had reinvented herself \u2013 but the Capa myth was so strong that, even when she died, some newspapers described her as Robert Capa's wife. Their lives were entwined, but she was very much her own woman, and he knew that. They both believed that their photographs could change the world and change the way people think. And their photographs did.\"\n\nFor details of The Mexican Suitcase, go to themexicansuitcase.com.

        "text": "In most major department stores, you have to hunt for the plus-size section, which is often tucked away in a far-flung corner. And, even when you find it, you\u2019re likely to encounter a slim, less-than-fashionable selection.\n\nBut go home, open up your computer and search for plus-size clothes online and you\u2019ll find a slew of websites selling stylish, high-quality garments.\n\nThe plus-size industry is growing. Sales climbed by 5% last year and the industry is now valued at $17.5 billion, according to Bloomberg. But the sector has been slow to move from online to brick-and-mortar stores. Now, that\u2019s beginning to change.\n\nAfter spending time modeling and blogging, Aimee Cheshire launched HeyGorgeous.com in 2014. Her goal was to provide plus-size women with an online retailer that stocked clothes with same style and quality as those sold by any trendy \u201cstraight-size\u201d company.\n\nBut a year after launching the online business, Cheshire realized there was more for HeyGorgeous to offer.\n\n\u201cWe take for granted the ease of going online and forget that human touch and interacting\u2014creating relationships\u2014is so important,\u201d Cheshire said. \u201cI forgot how much I enjoy being with my customers, and talking to them on a one-on-one basis and just touching, feeling, talking about the clothes.\u201d\n\nSo HeyGorgeous opened a showroom at the company\u2019s midtown Manhattan office. Clients can reserve a time, pick their clothing preferences and show up to a glamorous, personalized fitting.\n\n\u201cIf they come to the showroom and have a great experience and sip champagne and are chatting, they feel a little more comfortable trying on clothes that may be sleeveless or try a higher price-point that they\u2019re used to,\u201d Cheshire says.\n\nCheshire says she wanted to bring the human experience back to shopping for plus-size clothing. Many of her customers are used going into a store with straight-size friends and knowing that they won\u2019t be able to wear the clothes, she said. But the HeyGorgeous showroom changes that.\n\n\u201cYou want to experience the fun of shopping with your friends,\u201d Cheshire says. \u201cI want to give that opportunity to women who never had that before. It\u2019s quite exciting when you\u2019re finding clothes that your [non-plus-size] friends can\u2019t fit into or doesn\u2019t come in their size. I think there\u2019s something to be said for that experience.\u201d\n\nHeyGorgeous isn\u2019t the only plus-size ecommerce player exploring brick-and-mortar outposts. Online retailer ModCloth, which sells clothing from sizes XS to 4X, has been experimenting with in-person shops. In April, ModCloth decided to open a Los Angeles pop-up shop, called ModCloth IRL (in real life).\n\n\u201cMost of the folks at ModCloth had never interacted with the customer,\u201dsays CEO Matt Kaness. So they decided to do ModCloth IRL to allow the actual buyers and design team to work with customers by taking measurements, helping shoppers with fit and giving styling advice.\n\nWhen the pop-up was a hit, ModCloth opened a temporary fit shop in San Francisco with the intent of staying open for three weeks. Kaness says the shop has done so well that company has renewed the lease twice and now plans to remain open until early January.\n\nKaness, too, says he\u2019s witnessed the power of giving plus-size women a place to shop in the real world. He recounts a story told to him by Christine Shoptaw de Chavez, ModCloth\u2019s tech design manager. According to Kaness, Shoptaw de Chavez was helping one of the pop-up customers, when the shopper apologized for her body shape.\n\n\u201cChristine said, \u2018You\u2019re exactly the size that you should be. Don\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s our job to make you feel beautiful,\u2019 And the woman started crying,\u201d says Kaness.\n\nFor Kaness, that fit shops are a way to create that type of relationship between ModCloth and more of the company\u2019s customers.\n\n\u201cAs we thought about the future for ModCloth offline, it was that experience in a fitting room that one customer had that I think inspired all of us to want to recreate that,\u201d says Kaness.\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.",

Sometimes the scandal is not what law was broken, but what the law allows.\u201d\n\nThroughout 2015 the Australian parliament enacted a series of controversial laws that curbed privacy and freedom of expression rights.\n\nGeoffrey King, director of the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Technology Program, said the AFP\u2019s actions were \u201cobviously outrageous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis should not be happening. But it is the inevitable result of mandatory data retention and mass surveillance, which is neither necessary nor proportional to any threat,\u201d King said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the values that we all adhere to, to good counter-terrorism strategy, and it certainly doesn\u2019t line up with a free and open society where journalists can do their jobs.\u201d\n\nIn March 2015 the Australian Senate passed legislation requiring internet and mobile phone companies to retain customer metadata for 24 months. The bill was vehemently opposed by the Australian Greens, whose communications spokesman, Senator Scott Ludlam, called its new provisions a \u201cform of mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nAlthough a last-minute amendment obliged security agencies to get a warrant before accessing a journalist\u2019s metadata, the law essentially expands the Australian government\u2019s ability to conduct dragnet surveillance.\n\nAustralia, along with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, is part of the Five Eyes signals-intelligence sharing network.\n\nDocuments leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that Australian spying authorities had offered to share bulk metadata of ordinary Australian citizens with their partners in the Five Eyes network. Other documents Snowden leaked revealed Australian spies had attempted to listen in to the phone calls of former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, causing an extended diplomatic rift between the two countries.\n\nThe investigation into Farrell\u2019s sources, for a story relating to the activities of an Australian customs vessel and a controversial operation to turn back a boat carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia, was conducted in 2014, before the amendment passed parliament. Law enforcement did not need a warrant for accessing the information at the time.\n\nThe case marks the first time the AFP has confirmed seeking access to a journalist\u2019s metadata in a specific case, although the agency has admitted to investigating several journalists reporting on Australian immigration.\n\nThe acknowledgement that authorities had sought access to Farrell\u2019s records was only divulged after the reporter lodged a complaint with Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner under the country\u2019s Privacy Act.\n\nRelated: The AFP and me: how one of my asylum stories sparked a 200-page police investigation\n\nIn July 2015, the Australian government passed the Border Force Act, which criminalises whistleblowing from within Australia\u2019s hardline immigration detention network, making it an offense punishable with up to two years in prison.\n\nThe country\u2019s \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders\u201d, a harsh, military-led crackdown on asylum seekers who attempt to enter Australia by boat, includes a policy of turning back boats carrying migrants and deporting every arrival including children to harsh, offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific island state of Nauru, for permanent resettlement.",

The concept of binge watching had yet to be invented, so we consumed the show in small bites\u2014two each week\u2014and in a haphazard order (I calculated which season it was based on haircuts). If I wanted to know why Ross and Rachel were together one episode and apart the next, I had to go buy another set of DVDs or beg my friends to re-enact episodes.\n\nBut now that Friends is hitting Netflix on Jan. 1, no child will ever have to wonder whether Ross and Rachel really were \u201con a break.\u201d\n\nAnyone with the time should watch every episode of this show. Even if the laugh track feels dated and the jokes a little less edgy than Seinfeld, Friends is worth revisiting as a cultural artifact: Its final episode in 2004 was watched by 52.5 million people, a number that has yet to be topped by any show since. But for those who don\u2019t have the time to watch 10 whole seasons and just want to skim, here are the character backgrounds and the episodes you ought to watch.\n\nWho Are the Eponymous \u201cFriends?\u201d\n\nMonica Geller (Courtney Cox): Ross\u2019 sister, Phoebe\u2019s old roommate, Chandler and Monica\u2019s neighbor and Rachel\u2019s best friend from high school, Monica was conceived as the lynchpin of the group. Though she\u2019s a neat freak and a bit bossy, she acts as the de facto mom to the rest of the friends. At the beginning of the show, she takes Rachel in as her new roommate.\n\nRachel Green (Jennifer Aniston): At the beginning of the show, Rachel runs away from her wedding in order to try to forge a life of her own. A bit of a spoiled brat, she moves in with Monica and takes a job as a waitress at Central Perk (the coffee shop where the group spends most of its time) though she aspires to work in fashion. Rachel dates Ross on-again and off-again throughout the entire series.\n\nPhoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow): The oddball of the group, Phoebe is a professional masseuse and amateur musician. (Her claim to fame is the song \u201cSmelly Cat.\u201d) Though she has a bleak past\u2014Phoebe was homeless after her father abandoned the family and her mother committed suicide\u2014she is relentlessly optimistic. Phoebe and Monica used to live together, but Phoebe has moved out by the time the show starts.\n\nChandler Bing (Matthew Perry): Chandler first met Ross in college when the two were roommates. When he moved to New York, he became roommates with Joey across the hall from Monica and Phoebe. None of the friends know what Chandler does for a living\u2014something with numbers, maybe? Scarred by his parents\u2019 divorce, Chandler has major commitment issues. The self-described \u201cfunny one,\u201d he cracks jokes and makes sarcastic observations whenever the friends are hanging out.\n\nJoey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc): Though Joey isn\u2019t the smartest of the gang\u2014in fact, he\u2019s incredibly dumb\u2014he does do well with the ladies, wooing a new woman almost every episode. An aspiring actor, he relies on best friend and roommate Chandler financially until he gets his big break on a soap opera.\n\nRoss Geller (David Schwimmer): Ross is probably the nerdiest of the group. A paleontologist, he obsesses over dinosaurs, grammar and documentaries. Yet since high school, Ross has had a crush on the popular Rachel (his sister\u2019s best friend). But when Rachel reunites with the friends in the first episode, Ross\u2019 life is a bit complicated: His pregnant wife has just left him for a woman. Ross and Rachel\u2019s \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d chemistry drives much of the show.\n\nWho Are the Recurring Characters?\n\nGunther: Gunther works at Central Perk and has a not-so-secret crush on Rachel.\n\nRichard: Dr. Richard Burke is a friend of Monica and Ross\u2019 parents. He and Monica date seriously on-and-off throughout the series. Eventually their age difference causes problems in the relationship.\n\nJanice: The friends are always running into Chandler\u2019s ex with an unbearable voice and a penchant for yelling, \u201cOh. My. Gawd\u201d\n\nMike: In the later seasons, Phoebe meets and dates Mike (played by Paul Rudd!), a corporate lawyer-turned-musician who falls for her quirks\n\nUrsula: Ursula is Phoebe\u2019s twin sister (also played by Kudrow) who may be even crazier than Phoebe. The two have a rocky relationship.\n\nCarol: Carol is Ross\u2019 lesbian ex-wife and the father of his child, Ben.

Neither PwC, Deloitte, EY, nor Bain and Co. reveal their diversity numbers in this level of detail. What\u2019s more, IBM, another major Accenture competitor, is one of the few tech giants that still refuses to release its stats.\n\n\u201cWe already spend a lot of time and money and focus [on increasing diversity], and yet we\u2019re not making the progress that we want to, so we feel like we need to be disruptive,\u201d says Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, North America, on the company\u2019s decision to publish the data.\n\nThe release reveals that women account for about 36% of the company\u2019s total U.S. workforce.\n\nAccenture, which is No. 98 on Fortune\u2018s 100 Best Companies to Work For list, is roughly half white and a third Asian. Black employees make up 7.4% of the company\u2019s workforce, while Hispanic or Latino employees hold 6.3% of jobs.\n\nWomen lose some ground at the company\u2019s upper level, accounting for 31% of executives.\n\nThe executive ranks are also notably less diverse, with black and Hispanic employees accounting for just 4.4% and 3.7% of top jobs, respectively.\n\nIn addition, Accenture revealed that it currently employs 1,450 people who self-identify as persons with disabilities and 1,000 veterans. (The company has pledged to hire an additional 5,000 vets or spouses of vets by 2020.)\n\nAccenture has committed to releasing updated diversity numbers each year. Although it did not lay out specific goals for 2016, Sweet is clear that she expects the company to make gains over last year\u2019s stats: \u201cWe think we can do more.\u201d\n\nMaking the numbers public will hold the company accountable for showing improvement, she says. What\u2019s more, Sweet hopes that this new level of transparency will allow Accenture to have more explicit, productive discussions about race and gender internally.\n\nTo help speed the pace of change, the company also announced that it is starting a new referral program that will reward employees who refer women, black, Hispanic, and veteran candidates who end up getting hired. This comes on the heels of a slate of new parent-friendly policies announced last year, including 16 paid weeks of maternity leave and an option for new parents to work locally for one year after the birth of their child.\n\n\u201cWhen I took my new role as chief executive of North America, I had this realization that with 48,000 and a $14 billion business I had a real opportunity to make change \u2014 and I feel a deep sense of responsibility,\u201d Sweet says. \u201cI personally feel I will have failed if I do not make progress toward making us the most inclusive and diverse workforce in the U.S.\u201d",

A few steps away, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, construction has just begun, its bottom floors being measured with a ruler. And downstairs, the Roosevelt Island tram is slowly making its way through a test run.\n\nHalfway across the globe, workers in Beijing are creating another Great Wall of China, and in Buenos Aires, work is underway on the new Panama Canal.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of Gulliver\u2019s Gate, a miniature world that is being created by seven design teams in workshops around the world and will be brought together in a 49,000-square-foot exhibit space in Times Square. It is scheduled to open in April.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making something enormous, even though we\u2019re dealing with miniatures,\u201d Eiran Gazit, the chief executive of the project, said as he led a tour of the empty second floor of the building on West 44th Street (the old New York Times building), where the 1:87 scale models will be moved this fall. He pointed to pieces of green tape placed on the bare concrete floor. \u201cThis area here is Russia. You\u2019re actually standing on Siberia,\u201d he said. \u201cTowards that corner is the Middle East. Mecca. Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nMr. Gazit, who spent 14 years in the Israeli military, retired as a major. His second act was to build a 14-acre miniature version of Israel back in 1994 at 1:25 scale. It opened in 2003 near Latrun, in the Ayalon Valley of Israel. \u201cWhatever field I chose after the military, it had to be one without secrets,\u201d he said.\n\nHis miniatures are utopian. Gulliver\u2019s Gate will have a working airport, without terrorists. Model trains will run on time. There are no wars, no protests, no refugee camps \u2014 only tiny people going about their business amid landmarks of the world. Most of the 300 miniature models will represent the present. Some places will be re-creations of the past \u2014 like Chinatown and Little Italy, at the turn of the century. And some will envision the future. The model is not an exact replica of the world, just highlights.\n\nIn Hoboken, N.J., Washington is being built, without the bipartisan rancor. A mini-New York City, which is rising at Brooklyn Model Works, will include all the major tourist sites \u2014 the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the New York Public Library.\n\nThe builders hope to draw not only tourists to the $40 million project, but New Yorkers as well. \u201cWe want to give New Yorkers a good reason to go to Times Square,\u201d Mr. Gazit said.\n\nEach day, Mr. Gazit watches the progress of the work around the globe via a live stream, but he is leaving the design up to the different teams. \u201cI am not going to tell them what to show about their own places,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know much better than I do. I don\u2019t want an American interpretation of what life is like in Buenos Aires, for instance.\u201d\n\nMr. Gazit has 15 people on staff full time, and about 20 to 30 artists and designers working on each of the seven world sites. He began the project with $20,000 from a Kickstarter campaign in May 2014, but the primary backers are Irving and Michael Langer of the Brooklyn property management firm E&M Associates.\n\nMost of the buildings are designed first on the computer. Some are being made from parts from 3D printers and laser cutters, others from basic model kits that are then customized with local detail. The low-scale Greenwich Village buildings, for instance, include tarpaper roofs and distressed bricks.\n\n\u201cThe closer you look, the more you\u2019ll see,\u201d said Tim Gilman, the artistic director. \u201cWe want people to discover things on their own as they move through.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll move through New York at a magic hour: The lighting for the 44 miniature blocks has been designed to evoke dusk, when the whole city takes on a golden glow.\n\nProject Gulliver\u2019s Gate, a 1:87 scale model of world sights\n\nSite 216 West 44th Street, near Times Square\n\nDriving Force Eiran Gazit, a former officer in the Israeli military and creator of Mini Israel\n\nIn the Works Since 2014\n\nBiggest Obstacle Finding a landlord in the area willing to lease to an unknown brand.

At the other end of the age range, teenagers have climbed Everest and sailed around the world suggesting that, these days, you can\u2019t be too young either. Meanwhile, some of the most inspiring endeavours were achieved by the disabled.\n\nEven celebrities have got in on the act. Their high-profile endeavours have included David Walliams swimming the channel, Cheryl Cole climbing Kilimanjaro and Eddie Izzard running the length of Britain.\n\nAs the decade closes with fears of retreating glaciers and melting icecaps, old-school explorers seeking scientific knowledge have found themselves suddenly relevant again. What clearer way to prove that there is still very much a point to exploration in the 21st century.\n\nOn this page and overleaf, we look back and celebrate the best action-packed adventures of the decade, from the bold and brave, to the frankly crazy, but courageous.\n\nWho better to kick-start the decade than Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who came back from personal and physical misfortune to make the decade his own?\n\nHe began the new millennium by attempting to become the first person to ski unsupported and alone to the North Pole. It ended in disaster when, just days into the journey, his 300lb sledge fell through the ice and he put his left hand in the water to retrieve it. The subsequent frostbite ended his polar ambitions and he later famously sawed the blackened fingertips off himself. The incident could have finished the explorer\u2019s career. Instead he took up climbing, proving that they just don\u2019t make people like that anymore.\n\nExcept perhaps in the case of Jason Lewis. During the summer of 2000, the army officer\u2019s son became the first person to pedal across the Pacific Ocean as part of his epic circumnavigation of the globe. During the 178-day journey he developed septicaemia, nearly went mad and had to fight off a huge saltwater crocodile before he could beach safely in Australia.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only circumnavigator. On September 6, 60-year-old grandmother Jennifer Murray flew around the world, solo, in a helicopter. The 25,000-mile journey lasted 99 days.\n\nCircumnavigations were still the big theme for 2001. In August, 24-year-old Alastair Humphreys set out on his bicycle from his home in Yorkshire, on what Fiennes called \u201cthe first great adventure of the 21st century\u201d. Humphreys pedalled south across Europe and had reached Egypt by the year\u2019s end. He would eventually return four years later having cycled around the world via Africa and the Americas.\n\nIn the mountains, the climbing community was set abuzz by the stunning ascent of Ama Dablam\u2019s north-west ridge by two young British alpinists, Rich Cross and the late Jules Cartwright. In a 10-day epic, they made the first ascent of this coveted line up the 6,812m mountain without oxygen or Sherpa support. The ascent involved more than 5,000m of climbing that had previously defeated 11 teams.\n\nNearby, a guided American schoolteacher called Eric Weihenmeyer climbed Mt Everest. Nothing extraordinary about that \u2013 except that Weihenmeyer was blind.\n\nOn the oceans, the most spectacular feat was the first crossing of the 3,000-mile Atlantic by kayak. The man who achieved it was Welshman and former SAS soldier Peter Bray. He arrived on Ireland\u2019s west coast on September 5, after a journey of 75 days.\n\nThe winter of 2002 will not be forgotten easily by Ann Daniels, Caroline Hamilton and Pom Oliver. During their attempt to ski to the North Pole, they were hit by a three-day storm. Unable to put up their tent, all they could do was huddle under a tarpaulin as temperatures dipped below -58F (-50C). The team suffered frostbite, back problems and carbon monoxide poisoning. After 47 days Oliver was evacuated with wet gangrene, leaving Hamilton and Daniels to battle the remaining 300 miles to the Pole, which they reached on June 1.\n\nConditions were similarly uncomfortable for the alpinists Paul Ramsden and Mick Fowler who, in April, made the first ascent of Siguniang\u2019s north face in China. The 1,500m ascent, much of it on vertical ice and at altitude, took seven days to climb and two to descend.\n\nBad weather put paid to another climbing adventure in the autumn. French \u201cSpiderman\u201d Alain Robert attempted to climb Canary Wharf in East London but was thwarted by the notorious British drizzle.\n\nBut the weather wasn\u2019t all bad. In the tropical paradise of the Turks and Caicos islands, freediver Tanya Streeter plunged to a depth of 161m on a weighted sled to break the outright \u201cno limits\u201d record.\n\nThis was the year one of the last great polar firsts fell \u2014 the goal to reach the North Pole solo and unsupported from Canada. Pen Hadow, 41, had failed twice, but he\u2019d made a vow on his father\u2019s deathbed and wasn\u2019t going to give up easily. He set off on the 500-mile journey on March 17. Despite losing a ski one month in, he reached the Pole on May 19.\n\nIt was another first for Devonian explorers when Hadow\u2019s Dartmoor neighbour Simon Chalk rowed the Indian Ocean solo. He covered the distance of 4,027 miles in\n\nThis was also a year in which Exmoor\u2019s resident explorer, Sir Ranulph, hit the headlines again. First he suffered a massive heart attack that nearly killed him, then he ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents as if nothing had happened.\n\nHis exploits prompted the London Marathon\u2019s medical director to warn cardiac patients: \u201cRunning a marathon causes much greater stress to a normal mortal than to Sir Ranulph.\u201d\n\nOn November 6, British alpinists Ian Parnell, Kenton Cool and American John Varco completed the first ascent of the south-west ridge of Annapurna III - 7,555m in a 10-day push. Two years later, Cool would be the man charged with teaching Sir Ranulph to climb.\n\nThis year saw adventurers push the frontier across oceans, mountains, the atmosphere and on two wheels. In April, Ewan McGregor and sidekick Charley Boorman set off to motorcycle the \u201cLong Way Round\u201d the world.\n\nEarlier, Jamie Andrew, who lost both hands and feet to frostbite, was part of an all-disabled ascent of Kilimanjaro, Africa\u2019s highest mountain, together with Paul Pritchard, who suffers from severe paralysis, and two others.\n\nIn the Arctic, 26-year-old Ben Saunders became the third person to trek solo to the North Pole. At 640 miles, it was the longest solo Arctic journey yet undertaken by a Briton.\n\nMeanwhile, in May, British climber Paul Deegan was breathing heavily on the final summit slopes of Mt Everest when something caught his disbelieving eye \u2013 a microlight buzzing overhead. Its pilot was Richard Meredith-Hardy on his way to becoming the first \u2013 and only \u2013 person to fly an open cockpit, soft-winged plane over the mountain. Considering the cold, lack of oxygen and winds that exceeded his airspeed, it was a phenomenal feat.\n\nThe year closed with another aviation record falling. The prolific adventurer David Hempleman-Adams set a world altitude record for an open basket hot-air balloon, flying to 21,830ft.\n\nIn February, adventurer Tom Avery set off to \u201cput right one of the great injustices in polar history\u201d by retracing Admiral Peary\u2019s disputed 1909 journey to the North Pole. Using dogs and replica sledges, the team, led by a Canadian guide, raced the 500 miles to the Pole in a record 37 days. But far from settling the dispute, the polar establishment claimed it didn\u2019t prove anything.\n\nOn May 30, after a brutally exhausting 18-hour slog through avalanche-prone fresh snow, Alan Hinkes stood on the summit of Kanchenjunga, at 8,586m. For the 51-year-old Yorkshireman, it was the end of an 18-year odyssey to climb all 14 of the world\u2019s highest mountains over 8,000m. \u201cThe final summit push was without a doubt the hardest climb of my life,\u201d Hinkes reported.\n\nOn November 20, 32-year-old Dee Caffari set off on her attempt to sail single-handed the wrong way around the world, against the prevailing winds and currents. She would complete the voyage on May 18 the following year.\n\nHers wasn\u2019t the only record-breaking round-the-world voyage to leave British waters. The previous month, Adrian Flanagan had set off on a \u201cvertical circumnavigation\u201d via Russia\u2019s Arctic, but he wouldn\u2019t complete his voyage for another 30 months.\n\nOne was an amiable BBC presenter most likely to appear on children\u2019s animal programmes, the other was a former Olympic gold medallist rower. Yes, this was the year Ben Fogle and James Cracknell became Britain\u2019s best-known double act by rowing the Atlantic \u2013 naked. (See page 3.)\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only celebrities taking to water. In July, the comedian David Walliams swam the English Channel, raising more than \u00a31 million for charity. But the headlines were dominated by another fund-raiser \u2013 Jane Tomlinson. In July and August, she cycled 3,800 miles across the United States, raising \u00a3250,000. Often in excruciating pain, it was her last challenge before losing her fight against cancer the following year.\n\nSomeone else who showed that you can overcome adversity was Karen Darke. Despite being paralysed from the chest down, she traversed the 400 miles across Greenland on a sit-ski.\n\nEarlier in the year, Rob Gauntlett and James Hooper officially became the youngest Britons to summit Mt Everest, at the age of 19. Meanwhile, closer to home, the world finally caught up with the Peak District caver Dave Nixon. Despite discovering a 140m-deep chamber called Titan in 1999, it took until November of this year for the publicity shy pot-holer to tell the rest of us.\n\nOn January 20, a remarkable discovery was made by the most unlikeliest of explorers \u2013 country boys Rory Sweet, Rupert Longsdon and Henry Cookson. More used to tweed than Gore-Tex and Gloucestershire to uncharted glaciers, the hard-living trio walked and kite-skied 1,000 miles to Antarctica\u2019s Pole of Inaccessibility \u2013 the furthest point from land. En route, they unearthed a bust of Vladimir Lenin poking out of the snow which had lain untouched since the Russians left it in 1958.\n\nIn the jungles of Venezuela, the BBC raised the bar of exploratory adventure to new heights by dispatching wildlife presenter Steve Backshall up the unclimbed tabletop mountain, Upuigma, where he discovered some frogs unknown to science.\n\nElsewhere, Sara Campbell stunned the freediving world by breaking three world records in three days. Blind British adventurer Miles Hilton-Barber flew from London to Sydney in a microlight (helped by sighted co-pilots).\n\nIt was also a good year for sexagenarians with Sir Ranulph Fiennes climbing the north face of the Eiger at 62 and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston completing his second solo circumnavigation of the world in a yacht at 68.\n\nIn October, Jason Lewis rolled into London after 13 years and 46,505 miles around the world by bike, pedal boat, roller blades and kayak.\n\nOn February 13, the Swiss climbing phenomenon Ueli Steck stunned the mountaineering world with an astonishing speed ascent of the north face of the Eiger. While most parties allow five days, Steck soloed it in less than three hours.\n\nTwo days later another record fell \u2013 Scotsman Mark Beaumont rolled into Paris after cycling 18,297 miles around the world in a record 194 days.\n\nBut the year belonged to three truly epic voyages. In March, Ed Stafford set off to walk the entire length of the Amazon. Almost two years on he\u2019s lost his partner and his sponsor, he\u2019s been accused of murder, run out of food \u2013 and he\u2019s currently about halfway.\n\nOn May 15, former Royal Marine Phil Harwood began his odyssey to canoe the entire length of the Congo River from source to sea. He encountered rapids, swamps, crocodiles, malaria and rebel soldiers before emerging in the Atlantic, 2,900 miles later, in November.\n\nAnd Rosie Swale-Pope achieved a remarkable feat of endurance. After losing her husband to prostate cancer, she set off to run around the world, aged 57, in 2003. She finally arrived back on August 25 after clocking up 20,000 miles and going through 53 pairs of trainers.\n\nThe decade of adventure went out with a bang. The year kicked off with Pen Hadow\u2019s Catlin Arctic Survey, which measured the sea ice. Down Under, Sarah Outen became the first woman to row solo across the Indian Ocean at just 24, while 17-year-old Michael Perham completed the youngest single-handed sail around the world.\n\nBrazilian extreme kayaker Pedro Olivia raised the bar for loony antics by paddling off a 127ft waterfall. Elsewhere, British engineer Richard Jenkins smashed the world land-speed record for wind-powered vehicles, clocking 126.2mph in Greenbird.\n\nThe paraplegic sailor Hilary Lister, who controls her yacht by breathing through straws, sailed alone around Britain. And the indomitable Iraq War veteran Major Phil Packer ran the London Marathon, rowed the Channel and climbed El Capitan, despite severe injuries.\n\nEven celebrities showed they\u2019re made of sterner stuff. Cheryl Cole, Ronan Keating and Alesha Dixon all climbed Kilimanjaro for charity, while Eddie Izzard ran a seven-week, 1,100-mile marathon around Britain.\n\nThe daredevil rock climber Leo Houlding took adventure to new heights by parachuting into the Arctic, climbing Mt Asgard and then BASE-jumping off the summit. While on Everest it was finally third time lucky for Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who started the decade staring at defeat but ends it with a resounding triumph, proving that nothing brings success like perseverance.\n\nDisasters, tragedy and controversy \u2013 when expeditions didn\u2019t quite go to plan.\n\n2000 Peter Bray\u2019s first attempt to cross the Atlantic in a 27ft kayak ends after he capsizes off Canada.\n\n2001 Brian Milton\u2019s attempt to recreate Alcock and Brown\u2019s 1,800m direct flight across the Atlantic in a microlight crashes on take-off.\n\n2002 A few days into their bid to row the Indian Ocean, Simon Chalk and Bill Greaves are shipwrecked after hitting a submerged object.\n\n2003 Jennifer Murray, 63, and Colin Bodill, 54, narrowly escape death after crashing their helicopter in Antarctica.\n\n2004 Frenchwoman Dominick Arduin disappears a day into her attempt to become the first woman to ski solo to the North Pole.\n\n2005 Sir Ranulph Fiennes\u2019s first attempt on Mt Everest fails after he suffers an angina attack, 300m from the summit.\n\n2006 Huge controversy on Mt Everest as climbers are accused of walking past the dying climber, David Sharp.\n\n2007 Roz Savage gives up her Pacific rowing attempt 10 days in, after stormy weather causes her boat to capsize three times in 24 hours, losing vital equipment.\n\n2008 The British-built Vestas Sail Rocket becomes the fastest boat on water after nudging 50 knots, but then spectacularly crashes.\n\n2009 Olly Hicks sets off from Tasmania to row around the world, but gives up three months later, after getting no further than New Zealand.",

Both men have performed feats of such impossible endurance in such extreme conditions that they literally have become scientific curiosities.\n\nNorth of the Arctic Circle, 51-year-old Wim Hof is running. The frozen tundra typically is reserved for polar bears, but Hof isn't running for his life. He is running for sport: 26 miles, half-naked, wearing just shorts and sandals in bone-chilling, minus-25-degree temperatures.\n\nThey are conditions that would kill any normal man -- but Hof is no ordinary mortal.

What you are.\"\n\nHof's whole adult life has been dedicated to pushing the limits of human endurance. He's scaled Mount Everest, dived into the frigid waters beneath the North Pole and even turned himself into a human Popsicle -- immersing himself in ice for a record-setting 72 minutes, wearing only his signature shorts.\n\n\"It's almost beyond belief that someone, anyone, could live through that,\" said Dr. Ken Kamler, who specializes in extreme medicine. \"He's immersed in ice water. And water will transmit heat 30 times faster than air. It literally sucks the life right out of you.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"20/20,\" Hof explained why he isn't dead.\n\n\"I know my body.

(Ages 5 to 9)\n\nTHE STORY OF LITTLE BABAJI\n\nMichael di Capua Books/HarperCollins Publishers. $14.95.\n\nIn order to look at ''Sam and the Tigers'' and ''The Story of Little Babaji,'' many adults, and all of today's children, would be helped by a little bit of history. Madras in the summer of 1898 was no place for small girls of fair complexion -- especially since their father was busy investigating the causes of bubonic plague. Retreat to a villa in the hills was prudent, leaving Mother to divide her time between cool daughters and sweltering husband.\n\nTo keep the family's spirits up during her shuttle trips, Helen Bannerman turned to writing illustrated letters and telling homemade stories. Among the most successful of these was the tale of how Little Black Sambo bested a bunch of tigers who had tried to steal his clothes. She invented it on one of her train journeys down to Madras and made a little book out of it, which she illustrated and bound herself.\n\nIts success was not confined to the family, however. An English friend, due to return shortly to Britain, thought it ought to be published and volunteered to take the manuscript to London to negotiate a deal. Bannerman was not too keen on that, but with many injunctions against selling the copyright she let the little treasure go.\n\nAnd that was the last she saw of it, and almost the last direct connection she had with it. For her hapless friend fell in with the monocled publisher Grant Richards, and ''The Story of Little Black Sambo'' was spirited out of her grasp to be published in 1899 as the fourth volume in his Dumpy Books series. He bought the whole thing for just 5.\n\nHaving obtained the copyright, Richards then failed to protect it in the United States, and it wasn't long before the stateside predators moved in. The simple story, so well fitted for the dynamics of storytelling or the pages of a picture book, and costing nothing, was like a present, and ''Little Black Sambo'' soon began a trans-Atlantic career in magazines, in storybooks and in a host of unauthorized editions with rewritten texts and recast illustrations.\n\nOddly enough, the same thing was to happen a year or two later when Messrs. Frederick Warne forgot to copyright ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in the United States; but where Beatrix Potter's work was merely devitalized or vulgarized, ''Little Black Sambo'' had a harder time. Having begun life in India as an innocent companion to two homesick girls, it became, 60 years later, one of the principal miscreants accused of bringing racism into children's literature.\n\nAs far as Bannerman's hero was concerned, the main charges were his offensive name (along with that of Black Mumbo, his mother, and Black Jumbo, his father) and their cheerful but crude depiction in Bannerman's illustrations. Subsidiary charges related to a kind of illegal immigrant status, since the characters in the pictures appeared to be African while the setting, with its tigers and its ghee, was clearly Indian, and there was also trouble over Sambo's gross behavior in eating no fewer than 169 pancakes. Guilt by association was reflected back from the multiplicity of -- usually frightful -- unauthorized editions, and Sambo became a pariah.\n\nNow, however, as the boy approaches his 100th birthday, a rehabilitation begins. With great generosity of spirit, Julius Lester recognizes in his notes to ''Sam and the Tigers'' that Helen Bannerman's unpretentious tale ''transcended its stereotypes.'' ''What other story,'' he asks, ''had I read at the age of 7 and remembered for 50 years?'' Where lay the secret but in the story's ''truth of the imagination''?\n\nThus, with Jerry Pinkney, with whom he has also collaborated on versions of the Uncle Remus stories and a life of John Henry, Mr. Lester has fashioned a new telling, expanding the story and narrating it in a ''Southern black storytelling voice.'' Concurrently, Mr. Pinkney has converted the ''mythical quality'' of Bannerman's illustrations into pages filled with action.",

        "text": "\"Got a sneaker game so hot you lock your kicks to your ankles?\" reads the caption beneath the Facebook post announcing Adidas' new high-top sneakers. The German sports brand's proposed new shoes feature orange rubber shackles fixed to the back of the sneaker that can be attached around the ankle. The sneakers have since been dubbed the \"shackle shoes\" after rousing fury for its racist connotation.\n\nAdidas faced a furious backlash over its shackle shoes, or the JS Roundhouse Mids, from those who accused the brand of racism.\n\n\"The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive,\" wrote Reverend Jesse Jackson, for the Huffington Post. \"Removing the chains from our ankles and placing them on our shoes is no progress.\n\n\"For Adidas to promote the athleticism and contributions of a variety of African-American sports legends -- especially Olympic heroes Wilma Rudolph and Jesse Owens and boxing great Muhammad Ali -- and then allow such a degrading symbol of African-American history to pass through its corporate channels and move toward actual production and advertisement, is insensitive and corporately irresponsible.\"\n\nAlthough Adidas initially defended the designer of the shackle shoes, Jeremy Scott, as having a \"quirky\" and \"lighthearted\" vision, the company turned around and announced it would pull the sneakers from its line, according to CNN.\n\n\"The design of the JS Roundhouse Mid is nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery,\" the statement from Adidas said. \"We apologize if people are offended by the design and we are withdrawing our plans to make them available in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe photo still remains posted on Adidas' official Facebook page and, at the time of this posting, has more than 38,000 \"likes\" and almost 4,000 comments.\n\n\"I'm very glad Adidas has decided not to sell this shoe,\" commented one Facebook user. \"If you can't see how adding shackles to a pair of basketball sneakers is demeaning, you can't see much at all. Leaving that argument aside, these are not only butt ugly, but they were set to retail for THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. That's outrageous, given they have no function beyond making wearers look foolish.\"\n\n\"If any of you study the psychological effects of bondage in relation to any group of people or thing experiencing it under just or unjust conditions, studies show it's used to create fear, restrict and effect negatively the mental, physical and spiritual growth of the subject,\" commented another. \"But when man gets farther and farther away from true knowledge of self he begans [sic] to accept being treated like and animal and you can then sell him chains and bondage without resistane [sic].\"\n\n\"Forget the slavery angle for a moment -- why orange?\" asked another. \"Prison orange. Is prison an attractive concept now? 2/3 or more are filled with African American men. Is that the new cool... the new dope for un-incarcerated men, to emulate locked-up brothers by wearing symbols of their grief?\n\nOthers thought that the issue has been extremely overblown.\n\n\"Everyone equating these shoes with slavery are the true racists,\" wrote a Facebook user underneath the photo of Adidas' shackle shoes. \"They are the ones perpetuating stereotypes and are the reason this kind of talk is even an issue anymore.

        "text": "The White House made an offer to House Republicans today to avert the fiscal cliff that Republican aides familiar with the talks panned as \"a joke\", \"an insult\" and \"a complete break from reality.\"\n\nA Republican aide familiar with the offer that was presented to House Speaker John Boehner by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House congressional liason Rob Nabors confirmed that the $4 trillion package would raise $1.6 trillion in tax revenue up front. Republicans call that number too high and extreme to be offering two weeks into negotiations with a just a month left before the deadline.\n\nIn exchange for the added tax revenue, Democrats would give in on $400 billion in spending cuts from entitlement programs like Medicare and an aide said those cuts would not be immediate. Boehner slammed that number right after the meeting at a press conference though he would not say what the number should be.\n\nPlay Video Boehner: \"No substantive progress\" on \"fiscal cliff\" talks\n\n\"Unfortunately many Democrats continue to rule out spending cuts that must be part of any significant agreement that will reduce our deficit\" Boehner said.\n\nThe package would be structured in such a way that some tax increases would happen now and tax reform would happen next year. Tax rates for the wealthiest two percent would go up immediately.\n\nTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at the U.S. Capitol for meetings with congressional leaders November 29, 2012.\n\nThe offer, according to Republicans, would also include $50 billion in stimulus spending in the form of infrastructure projects, an extension of unemployment benefits and a extension of the two percent payroll tax break.\n\nThe White House would also like to avoid future fights over raising the debt ceiling by taking it out of Congress altogether. While Congress could act to block a debt limit increase, it would not be necessary for Congress to approve one.\n\nOne Republican aide expressed outrage that the White House would ask for that with no reforms attached at all. Earlier today, Boehner said, that \"there is a lot of things that I have wanted in my life but almost all of them had a price tag attached to them.\n\n\"If we're going to talk about the debt limit in this, then there is going to be some price tag associated with it.\"\n\nDemocrats have been equally critical of Republicans in negotiations so far saying that Republicans have not put a real revenue offer on the table since they have not said how much money they'd be willing to put to the deficit through tax revenue.\n\n\"Right now, the only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates,\" Deputy White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a written statement.\n\n\"The President has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts and we remain willing to do tough things to compromise, and it's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices - from the business community to middle class Americans across the country - who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.\"\n\nDespite the appearance of talks breaking down today, Boehner said he's still optimistic a deal can be reached.\n\nThe White House's Nabors also seemed determined to keep talking.\n\n\"We're going to keep working with folks just like we have been and, you know, we'll make progress.\"",

        "text": "Is the hedge fund, as we know it, dead? Fifteen years ago, they were the hottest investments around. Every pension fund, endowment, and foundation clamored to get into this elite club, willing to pay hefty fees for the prospect of outsized returns.\n\nBut much has changed since the financial crisis. Except for the top hedge funds, most have shown disappointing performance since 2008, not even beating stock index returns. It seems the edge many had in outmaneuvering the markets has evaporated in more complex times. Red Sox owner John Henry is shutting down the commodities hedge fund shop that made him rich, the latest in a line of big names to retire. Others have been ensnared in a federal insider-trading inquiry that has tainted the industry, revealing a host of players who used unfair, and illegal, tactics to notch big gains.\n\nNow many large investors that favored hedge funds \u2014 from the Massachusetts state pension fund to Harvard University to small-town retirement funds like Plymouth\u2019s \u2014 are rethinking their approach to this once high-flying sector. They\u2019re looking less for the shoot-the-lights-out performance that hedge funds touted in the \u201990s, and more for traditional hedging and ways to reduce volatility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very crowded, and more and more difficult for them to show good performance,\u201d said Michael Trotsky, head of the $50 billion state pension fund and a former hedge fund manager himself. \u201cThe challenge becomes gaining access to only the very best, or you might as well go home.\u201d\n\nHedge funds are designed for institutions and the wealthy; they can invest in almost anything and usually take bigger risks than, say, a mutual fund meant for a typical investor with a 401(k) plan.\n\nTo be clear, hedge funds are still getting launched and money is still gushing into them; the sector recently notched a record $2.2 trillion in assets. But a majority of the new funds are shifting away from classic stock strategies and focusing instead on approaches such as interest rate bets and positions following the moves of the economy.\n\nOne reason for the shift: Far fewer hedge funds are producing big returns. And the gap between the best and the worst is enormous, suggesting that risks far outweigh the rewards when it comes to less-than-stellar funds. For the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, the top 10 percent of funds reported an average gain of 34 percent, while the bottom 10 percent saw an average 19 percent loss, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. of Chicago.\n\nSophisticated investors like the Massachusetts state pension fund and Harvard University are able to get access to the best hedge funds. But even they are looking more critically at these investments and considering alternatives.\n\nOne of Trotsky\u2019s first tasks running the state pension fund was explaining losses in two hedge funds raided by the FBI for alleged insider trading. These were relatively small holdings, worth $66 million. But the revelations laid bare a bigger issue: Three of the middleman firms the state used to gain access to hedge funds \u2014 called funds-of-funds \u2014 all had invested in one of the raided managers.\n\nSo much for spreading the risk. The state is now abandoning funds-of-funds,reasoning that they did not come up with original investment ideas or properly monitor their picks. Even with money divvied among more than 230 hedge funds, the state saw disappointing returns and high fees while becoming exposed to a number of investment scandals, including the Madoff scheme.\n\nThe state has 10 percent of its assets, or $5 billion, in hedge funds; Harvard has 15 percent, or about $4.7 billion. Both have increased their hedge fund allocations over time, although Harvard in the past year has backed off from 16 percent.\n\nThese and other institutional investors are also looking more critically at the firms they\u2019re willing to invest with and their costs. Many are abandoning funds-of-funds because of their lack of transparency and extra layer of fees.\n\nInvestors pay a fee of 1 percent to 2 percent upfront for access to most hedge funds, (plus another 1 percent or so in a fund-of-funds). After that, the hedge fund manager gets 20 percent of any gains they make on the investments, after certain hurdles. So, if you make $1 million, the hedge fund manager gets $200,000 of that.\n\nInvestors were willing to pay up when hedge funds generated fat profits for them during long bull markets. But in the volatile markets since 2008, many hedge funds have been unable to beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, or even the bond market.\n\nSome argue they\u2019re not supposed to \u2014 they\u2019re oriented so they don\u2019t correlate directly with the movements of stocks or bonds. But it\u2019s hard for many investors to justify the extra risk and enormous fees if they could do better in a simple index fund.\n\n\u201cWhen asset values are going up, regardless of strategy, people aren\u2019t focusing on fees as much as they should,\u2019\u2019 said David Scharfstein, a professor of finance and banking at Harvard Business School. If gains continue on a more modest track, he said, there will likely be more pressure on fees.\n\nAnother strike against hedge funds is the cash crunch they caused investors during the crisis. Institutions couldn\u2019t get their money out, because many hedge funds impose lockups, allowing money to be withdrawn only quarterly or less often. And in bad times, they can put up \u201cgates,\u201d barring withdrawals until markets calm down. In 2008 and 2009, many investors were suddenly faced with not only poor results, but a serious liquidity problem.\n\nThat led to a massive exodus from some funds once investors were able to get their hands on their money. Harvard has made a concerted effort to bring more assets in-house since 2008. The endowment\u2019s chief, Jane Mendillo, is a fan of \u201creal assets\u201d \u2014 including real estate, natural resources, and publicly traded commodities \u2014 which make up 25 percent of the portfolio, significantly more than hedge funds.\n\nGaining access to the best hedge funds matters more than ever. Dan Farley, senior managing director of State Street Global Advisors in Boston, said clients need to be clear on what they are looking for in a hedge fund, and realistic about whether they can get it.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get into the funds that meet your objectives and have top managers,\u201d Farley said, \u201cyou\u2019re probably better off looking to other alternatives.\u201d\n\nTrotsky is spending a lot of time on this issue, even teaching a class last year at the Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst where he assigned students to look for products that could model the risk/return profile of hedge funds at lower cost. He recently hired Eric Nierenberg, a Harvard-trained economist, to help analyze hedge funds, and to start thinking about alternative investments for the state. Trotsky has pledged a goal of saving the pension fund $100 million in fees in coming years, and a big part of that would come from hedge funds.\n\n\u201cWhat I want Eric to investigate is whether there are other techniques, or products, or ways to do it as effectively at a much reduced price,\u2019\u2019 Trotsky said.\n\nDozens of towns and cities around the Commonwealth are counting on Trotsky and the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board to deliver better returns from hedge funds, to help meet their retirement obligations. Thomas Kelley, chairman of Plymouth\u2019s retirement board, which oversees about $120 million, said he\u2019s keeping a close eye on the new approaches.\n\n\u201cI think it may be a change for the better,\u201d Kelley said, \u201cbut if it doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019ll take our money out.\u2019\u2019",

        "text": "Shall it be the Congolese goat stew or the Scottish red-legged partridge? The yam leaves in peanut paste with salted fish, or the wild rabbit terrine? We decide to go for a bit of everything. I'm having dinner with the artist Carsten H\u00f6ller in his latest project, the Double Club. This is a bar, restaurant and dance club where the Democratic Republic of Congo meets the west, and the west meets Congo. At least, that's the idea.\n\nThe club is up an alley beside Angel tube station in Islington, London, and we seem to be neither here nor there. I am confused. We drift between continents, choosing from two simultaneous menus. The most expensive dish on tonight's western menu is cote de boeuf, at \u00a342 for two, while the liboke na mbisi (conger eel in marantaceae leaves) is only \u00a311. The conger is very good, but my favourite is the goat.\n\nThis is not, H\u00f6ller says, some misplaced collision of world cuisines. \"There's no fusion here!\" he insists, and wants everything to be as authentic as possible. Nor has he suddenly decided to become a chef.\n\nThe restaurant - overseen by Mourad Mazouz, founder of London restaurants Momo and Sketch - is learning to cope; in another part of the club, a man in a boiler suit is still tinkering with the as-yet-unfinished dancefloor. Tomorrow, when the club opens, this will rotate, at one revolution per hour, turning between the Congolese and western sides of the club. The DJs will sit on the revolving platform, playing Congolese music or western dance, depending on which side of an invisible international divide they find themselves. So far, the only concession to Africa in the dance hall is a gaudy, kitsch plastic palm tree. The ceiling bristles with disco lighting equipment, which also rotates. But tonight it all feels far away.\n\nH\u00f6ller is best known in the UK for the slides he installed in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in 2006. They were enormously popular with the public, which deflected any doubts about their status as art - which, in any case, is an ever more complicated question. H\u00f6ller currently has a revolving hotel bedroom, where visitors can book a night between satin sheets, in the group show theanyspacewhatever, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. It's booked out for the entire duration of the exhibition, even though you must spend the night watched over by a museum guard.\n\nSponsored by the Fondazione Prada in Italy, the Double Club will stay open for the next six months. When H\u00f6ller suggested the idea, he was convinced Prada would turn it down. Not only did they say yes, they insisted on London as a venue. Now he's trying to encourage the Congolese community to come, as well as the regular club scene, plus the foodies, the art crowd, and an inquisitive public.\n\nWeek one, and the atmosphere hasn't quite kicked in yet. The cooking has yet to hit its stride, though the barbecue was firing up nicely out in the big open space where the western and Congolese bars collide: swanky lights, serious cocktails and high bar-stools on one side; a knocked-together wooden bar, a big Primus Bi\u00e8re sign on the wall and plastic garden furniture on the other. On good-weather nights, the roof opens up. The whole place is a cultural mash-up, in what feels like a good way. In the restaurant, there are paintings by Andy Warhol and Italian artists Alighiero e Boetti and Carla Accardi. A big wall-relief by Louise Nevelson is due to arrive. The decor is still being tinkered with. Out in the bar there's a huge portrait by Kinshasa-based painter Ch\u00e9ri Samba, and in a corner a seating area of Portuguese tiles, which continue up the wall, their glazed surfaces depicting the utopian, sci-fi apartment blocks of 1920s Russian architect Georgi Krutikow. Sometimes, it is hard to penetrate the logic.\n\nAs if this weren't confusing enough, there are three Congos, H\u00f6ller tells me. There's the former Belgian colony of DRC on one side of the river, and the much smaller former French colony of Congo-Brazzaville on the other. A third Congo exists entirely in the European mind, a mentality and a false memory that has at its core Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. What about today's civil war? It is far from Kinshasa, H\u00f6ller, a frequent visitor, tells me. He has been visiting the DRC, a place as big as western Europe, since around 2000, having first travelled to Benin in the mid-1990s. He fell in love with the music, the vitality and complexity of Congo's culture.\n\nH\u00f6ller himself is German, although born and brought up in Belgium. He now lives in Stockholm. Before becoming an artist, he was a biologist. I ask him what led him away from science: was it the nerdiness of science types, all those beards? The beards were definitely a problem, he says; scientists are so nervous of being regarded as charlatans, they don't want people to think they care what they look like.\n\nBut aren't people suspicious about art and artists, I ask - and is the Double Club an art work? Half art, half not, he tells me, like the slides. For a lot of people, especially the kids who used them, the slides were just a playground. Niceties about what might be art don't appear to worry H\u00f6ller. Not so long ago, he installed a carousel with chairs in chains in London's Gagosian gallery. He seems to like things that go round and round. The club, he says, is also here for people who are hungry, and people who want to drink, dance and meet their friends. H\u00f6ller admits he doesn't party much these days. He likes to spend his evenings at home, beside a lake near Stockholm, where he breeds nightingales for a hobby. I ask him if he's ever eaten one. Only the tongues, he tells me. This could be a wind-up, but there is something entirely genuine about the artist.\n\nEarlier this year, H\u00f6ller and I took part in a discussion about art and food at Ferran Adri\u00e0's world-famous El Bulli restaurant in Catalonia. During the discussion, chef Heston Blumenthal was wary of describing what he did as art, and H\u00f6ller also expressed doubts about his own status as an artist. \"I just want to play out some things in my life,\" he now says.\n\nH\u00f6ller is, I think, simply curious about the world. Just as the Double Club is intended to be two places at once, he likes the idea of spending half the year in Sweden, half in Africa. Like the nightingales, he says, on their annual migrations. This sounds magical, but the logistics come down to hard reality. As well as having Mazouz on board, the project has been overseen by Jan Kennedy, who opened the restaurant Quo Vadis with Marco Pierre White back in the 1990s. Design studios and architects have also played their part. H\u00f6ller is the impresario of all this.\n\nDescribing the fear, pleasure and out-of-control screaming abdabs some participants experienced as they sped earthward on his Tate slides, H\u00f6ller has talked about people as \"pleasure bundles\", and the effect his art has on us as bodies in space. Space is not just physical. And we are not only bodies in space, but minds, too. H\u00f6ller, I think, wants to take us out of ourselves and re-find some pleasure in the world. That includes eating, drinking and having fun. Does this make him an artist or just an entertainer?\n\nAfter a certain point in the evening, the question no longer seems interesting. Instead, we toy with our northern European winter comfort food, and the Congolese stews and barbecues, having our rumbles in the disco jungle, and following the footsteps of Kurtz in Heart of Darkness (\"The horror! The horror!\") as we spill out into the cold glare of the credit crunch, the 5am Islington morning.\n\nThe Double Club, at 7 Torrens Street, London EC1, opens tomorrow. Details: thedoubleclub.co.uk",

        "text": "Welcome to the post, post-Lehman era.\n\nEarlier this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported the results of self-administered stress tests. The results do not hold as much significance as the ones administered later this year by the Federal Reserve, but they were notable. For the first time since the financial crisis, the stress tests showed that, at a number of banks, a key measure of readiness for the next crisis had dropped.\n\nCitigroup C , for instance, said its tier one capital ratio\u2014the amount of money a bank has on hand to cover loan and investment losses\u2014would drop to 8.4% in another severe downturn. That\u2019s down from 9.1% a year ago. At Morgan Stanley MS , capital levels could fall to 8.9%, down from 9.5% a year ago. Wells Fargo WFC dipped to 9.6% from 9.9%. And JPMorgan Chase JPM said it would have enough capital after a stress scenario to cover losses on 8.4% of its remaining risky assets, down from 8.5% a year ago.\n\nGoldman Sachs GS was the only bank that came out looking better than it did last year, 10.4% versus 8.9%. Bank of America\u2019s BAC results were the same as they were last year.\n\nThe drops are relatively small. And the banks are still far more prepared for a downturn than they were before the last recession. But the banks have spent much of the past six years socking away extra cash to make them look as safe as possible. Now, the pendulum is swinging back.\n\nBut there were signs of that already. About a month ago, the FDIC reported that, as of mid-year, banks had boosted lending by nearly $400 billion in the past 12 months, the biggest jump since late 2008. Also, at the end of the second quarter, JPMorgan reported that it was taking increased risk on its trading desk. It appeared to be one of the few banks to do so. But the others are likely to follow. The banks will report new risk numbers a few weeks from now, along with their earnings reports.\n\nAlready, some regulators are getting nervous. Bank regulators have warned a number of banks about a return to risky lending. And the Fed is contemplating new rules that would require the big banks to continue to add to their capital piles.\n\nRemember, though, all of this renewed risk is good for the economy. While the Fed is telling banks not to take too much risk, its low interest rate policy is intended to get banks to lend more and, well, take more risk. And the fact that banks are lending more means the Fed\u2019s efforts have been, at least partly, a success.\n\nRegulators and the rest of us should not want the risk-taking pendulum to swing in just one direction. The question is whether the rules passed in the wake of the financial crisis will stop it from swinging too far back in the wrong direction.",

        "text": "BY JOHN H. FENTON; SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMESJUNE 28, 1964\n\nBOSTON, June 27\u2014A Metho\u00addist minister from Boothbay Harbor, Me., has suggested that the John Birch Society may well be \u201con the road to respect\u00adability if its money holds out.\u201d\n\nThe minister is the Rev. Dr. J. Allen Broyles. He said, how\u00adever, that such \u201crespectability\u201d tvas \u201cstill quite a distance clown the street.\u201d In the meantime, he said, others might just as well learn to manage the prob\u00adlem of coexistence with the ul\u00adtra\u2010conservative organization.\n\nThe minister expressed his views in \u201cThe John Birch So\u00adciety; Anatomy of a Protest,\u201d ($4.50), recently published by the Beacon Press. It was a re\u00advision of a doctoral dissertation submitted to the department of sociology and social ethics of the Boston University Graduate School.\n\nIn defining respectability, Dr. Broyles said that Robert H. W. Welch Jr., the founder of the society, had always maintained that his members were made up of \u201creal, solid citizens.\u201d The minister did not interview Mr. Welch in compiling his mate\u00adrial.\n\n\u201cMost of the members I in\u00adterviewed were in the middle or upper\u2010middle class, but most of them were \u2018fringe\u2019 within their communities, due partly, of course, to their outlandish views which are part and par\u00adcel of the ideology of the socie\u00adty,\u201d said Dr. Broyles. \u201cTheir socio\u2010economic status qualified them for \u2018respectability,\u2019 but their politics did not.\u201d\n\nThe minister saw the soci\u00adty's executive council exerting a continuing moderating in\u00adfluence on Mr. Welch. He ex\u00adpected that this would lead to Mr. Welch's views and interests becoming \u201csomewhat more re\u00adstrained and conventional.\u201d\n\nThe Birch Society, Dr. Broy\u00adles contended, would begin a \u201crapid downward spiral\u201d if a\n\nAn Arizona member told the minister that he thought the conservative movement, of which the Birch Society was a part, \u201cis basically a protest by people over the loss of individ\u00aduality.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its purported mission of fighting Communists, the Birch Society also professes to fight \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\nAbout the time Dr. Broyles's book was being displayed in book stores, a report filed with the office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, Edward W. Brooke, showed the society had ended 1963 with a deficit of $210.952.\n\nThe report, required by law, showed gross income of $1,043,\u00ad656 and expenses of $1,169,997 in 1963.

        "text": "PHOENIX -- When the Diamondbacks acquired shortstop Didi Gregorius, general manager Kevin Towers compared Gregorius' defense to that of \"a young Derek Jeter.\"\n\nIt might have been an undersell.\n\nD-backs bench coach and four-time Gold Glove winner Alan Trammell is not given to hyperbole, but he could not help but rave about Gregorius' scoop and throw from deep in the hole in the seventh inning of a 5-1 victory Friday.\n\nTo balance things, Gregorius used his bat to make a difference Saturday.\n\nHis three-run home run broke a 2-2 tie in the last of the eighth inning, giving the D-backs' a 5-2 victory over San Diego and assuring a series victory against a team they could catch for third place in the NL West.\n\nGregorius drove an 0-2 fastball into the front row of the right field seats to break a 2-for-39 slump.\n\nAs his fielding play Friday showed, Gregorius has no trouble separating his offense from his defense.\n\nAs his homer Saturday showed, his constant work in the batting cage can have its rewards.\n\nGregorius has been retooling his swing since spring training, and the process has included the expected stops and starts. At the same time, he has been an eager, attentive student. There were Gregorius and Jake Lamb, who hit his first major league homer Saturday, taking extra batting practice with hitting coach Turner Ward hours four hours before the game Saturday.\n\n\"I would say, about time,\" Gregorius said of his home run. \"I've been working, getting better, going down in the cage every day, just trying to make improvements. Luckily, I got one right there.\"\n\nHe has not let the dry spell bring him down.\n\n\"Just go at-bat by at-bat, don't worry about it. I can't change it. I don't really think about it. Just go out and play the game. Don't drag one at-bat to the next one,\" Gregorius said.\n\nHis perseverance has not gone unnoticed, so much so that the shortstop battle won by Chris Owings last spring is beginning to look like another open competition entering the 2015 season.\n\n\"He's worked very hard. He hasn't had instant gratification or instant results, and it is good to see that happened to him tonight,\" Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. \"He's made some changes and he hasn't been rewarded much, but tonight it came through for him.\"\n\nOne of Gregorius' major selling points is his glove, the part of his game that was evident when he was promoted to the D-backs early last season after a hand injury sidelined second baseman Aaron Hill for 10 weeks. It is one of the reasons the Yankees, among many others, have had scouts watching him this season as Jeter finishes up.\n\nGregorius is most proud of the diving, full-extension stop and throw from his backside to start a double play against Tampa Bay here last season, and those who saw that still smile when they remember it.\n\n\"Everybody in the bullpen jumped out of their chairs, screaming and going nuts. It was unbelievable,\" D-backs reliever Brad Ziegler said.\n\nThe play Friday was similar. Gregorius went far into the hole at shortstop, almost behind third baseman Lamb, to field a sharp grounder by Jedd Gyorko. Gregorius gloved the ball and in one motion, without stopping or planting his feet, whipped a throw to that hit first baseman Mark Trumbo's glove chest-high.\n\n\"I was astonished,\" Trumbo said.\n\nWhen looking at the 6-foot-2, 205-pound Gregorius, Trammell sees the evolution of the position.\n\n\"These guys, including Didi, it's a different breed now,\" said Trammell, who won who Gold Gloves in Detroit in 1980-81 and 1983-84.\n\n\"They're better. They're more athletic. The plays on the run that we are seeing like Didi's, that's definitely one of the best plays I've ever seen, especially with the amount of velocity (on the throw). It wasn't a balloon over there. He is going full speed the opposite direction, not stopping, throwing the ball on the run, on a line. It was an incredible play.\n\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen one better.\"\n\nWhen Gregorius was a teenager at a tryout camp in the Dominican Republic, his velocity was registered at 94-95 mph on a throw from right field to third base.\n\nWhen he saw the throw heading right at Trumbo's mitt Friday, he just kept running toward the D-backs' dugout. When he got to the dugout, his teammates made jokes.\n\n\"The guys say funny things. Yesterday they told me at least make it look a little bit harder,\" Gregorius said.\n\nIt has been that kind of weekend.\n\nThe D-backs dugout gave rookie Jake Lamb a 45-second silent treatment following his first major league home run in the second inning. Lamb played along with it nicely, putting up some air high-fives as he entered the dugout and made his way to a seat at the far end of the bench.\n\n\"I went in there and saw nobody was around,\" Lamb said. \"I like to have fun. I started giving high fives to nobody.\"\n\nA short while later, everyone on the bench crowded around him to celebrate.\n\n99 -- Career saves by Addison Reed\n\n*Again, Vidal Nuno deserved better. He allowed five players to reach base in 7 1/3 innings -- two singles, two walks and a hit batsman -- but was left with a no-decision when two of his inherited runners scored in the top of the eighth inning to tie the game at 2. Despite a 3.54 ERA, he is 0-3 and winless in nine D-backs' starts, extending a franchise record for starters. \"It's part of the game. I just try to go deep in ball games. I've just been unlucky,\" Nuno said. \"I'll keep on fighting, and one day I'll get it.\"\n\n*Chris Owings started at second in his rehab game at Triple-A Reno on Saturday and will see occasional time at second base when he returns to the major leagues in a week or so, manager Kirk Gibson said. \"I just have a curiosity,\" Gibson said. \"I know he can play short. We have some games left here in the last month. Why not put him over there at second as well? We played him over there in spring training as well. You're looking ahead at who might be where (in 2015). It is a possibility.\" Owings, Gregorius, Aaron Hill, Cliff Pennington and minor leaguer Nick Ahmed give the D-backs deep depth in the middle infield, furthering the notion that an offseason trade with come from there.\n\n*Addison Reed pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his 30th save and is on a good run. He has converted his last 10 save attempts, tying a career high set with the Chicago White Sox from Aug. 6-27, 2013.\n\nThe D-backs seem more and more likely to go to a six-man rotation in September, and Randall Delgado could make some starts down the stretch, Gibson said. Delgado has made progress on his third pitch, a breaking ball, and has shown flashes. \"If you gave him a chance to start, would it help him be able to work his way through and have more consistency?\" Gibson said. \"That question hasn't been answered yet. but those are things we think about.\"\n\nFollow Jack Magruder on Twitter",

Within a couple of months, they'd decided to see each other exclusively.\n\nBut the relationship was not without its drama. In September of 2012, following a Routh family gathering during which the former Marine threatened to kill himself and others, Weed got a voicemail from him late that night. He had been admitted to Green Oaks, a psychiatric hospital in Dallas.\n\n\"He was upset and tearful,\" she testified, recalling the next time she saw him after he'd been transferred to the Veterans Administration hospital. \"He asked if he could come stay with me at my apartment.\" Weed agreed.\n\nRouth also had another question. Weed recalls that he asked her to marry him, but she turned him down at the time: \"I told him not until he was allowed to have shoelaces.\"\n\nThe couple began living together at Weed's apartment, but after less than a month, \"we'd begun to get on each other's nerves,\" she said, adding that they took a break from the relationship until late November.\n\nJanuary of 2013 proved to be a volatile month for the couple. Weed testified about several incidents in which she was called by Routh or a family member, asking her to come help him. On one occasion, she arrived at his house to find him \"sitting on the couch, just staring at the wall for several hours.\"\n\nAnother time, he called and asked her to pick him up from his house. When she got there, he ran toward the car with his dog Girlie in tow.\n\n\"He jumped in the car, screaming, 'Go, go, go!' \" she recalled.\n\nOn another night at her apartment, \"he started calling me names, accusing me of drug usage and that I was trying to steal his soul. He kept insisting that I take him back to Lancaster because he was gonna die that night and wanted to say goodbye to his mom.\"\n\nThe following morning, on Jan. 19, Routh, Weed and her roommate were all at the apartment. The couple had made plans to visit his attorney about a DUI charge, but as they approached the front door, he grabbed one of their decorative ninja swords and said, \"We're not going anywhere.\"\n\n\"He thought people were out to get us and we had to stay in the apartment, because the apartment was safe,\" Weed said, adding later that she didn't feel threatened.\n\nRouth then traded the ninja sword for a large knife he pulled from a butcher's block in the kitchen. Weed texted her roommate that \"Eddie's in a mood,\" and that she shouldn't leave her room.\n\nEventually, police arrived and the roommate escaped by running out through the back patio door and jumping over a fence. Routh was again taken to Green Oaks and transferred to the VA hospital. He was released six days later.\n\nThe week following his release was full of arguments between the couple, mostly about his marijuana habit and tobacco use. On the night of Feb. 1, following a fight, \"he got a legal pad out and started writing things down,\" she says. \"I tried to speak, but he covered my mouth because he said he didn't want them to hear what I was saying.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jane Starnes noted that one of the things he'd written on the legal pad was \"that y'all should make pot cupcakes to make a lot of money.\"\n\n\"Do you want to have a career making pot cupcakes?\" she asked Weed.\n\n\"No,\" she replied, adding that she also didn't want to go into the goat lawn-care business or have a bunny rabbit farm, both of which had been brought up by Routh in the past.\n\nBefore they went to bed that night, Weed asked if he'd taken his medication that day. He said he hadn't, and that he also hadn't eaten anything.\n\n\"We were in the kitchen and I was getting his medication for him,\" she said. \"I turned back around to see him on his knees, and he asked me to marry him. I said yes, and he got up and wrapped his arms around my stomach and started crying.\n\n\"We ate some of Jodi's spiced crackers and we went to bed,\" she added.\n\nThe next morning, the two had another bad argument, this time over chewing tobacco that Eddie was using. She texted Routh's uncle, James Watson, saying, \"You'd better get here quick. I'm about to kill your nephew.\"\n\nWhen Watson arrived, Routh kicked Weed out of the house.\n\n\"He was washing dishes and he did have a knife when he told me to leave,\" she confirmed to Starnes.\n\nHours later, Chris Kyle would arrive at the house, walk up the gravel driveway and say, \"You must be Eddie.\" According to testimony from Routh's mother, Kyle was in the dark about any specifics of Routh's recent behavior.\n\nKyle, Littlefield and Routh left for the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range in Kyle's black pickup truck. That afternoon, Routh showed up at his sister's house in the truck, alone.\n\n\"Hey, what's up,\" Routh said to his sister and her husband, Gaines Blevins. The three sat at the dining room table, \"and he said he'd killed two guys,\" Blevins recalled. \"I didn't believe him, because he's said crazy stuff before.\"\n\nBut then Routh went into more detail: He mentioned Kyle by name. He said they'd gone to a gun range. He told them he sold his soul for a pickup truck.\n\n\"I said, 'If this is true, you've got to turn yourself in,' \" Blevins testified. \"You can't just go around killing people.\"\n\nShe then said she was calling the police. As they walked toward the front door, Blevins got her first look at what he was driving.\n\n\"I felt like I was about to throw up,\" she said, \"because this could be a real possibility.\"\n\nThat afternoon, \"the person who came in that house was not who I knew as my brother,\" she told the court. After she told him she loved him but hated his demons, \"for a moment, he was my little baby brother. I could tell he needed me. But it switched back so quickly.\"\n\nThe trial continued on Thursday, as the defense makes its case for the jury to find Routh\n\n. The prosecution rested on Tuesday.",

        "text": "A trilogy of films curated by a maverick writer-director, unfolding in nine-year installments and starring the same actors playing the same characters. No, it\u2019s not Richard Linklater\u2019s celebrated \u201cBefore\u201d project, with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy living out the long arc of a relationship, but the much less heralded \u201cHenry Fool\u201d trilogy from Hal Hartley. A major indie auteur in the 1990s, Hartley has been nigh invisible the past decade, but he has kept plugging away in his signature style: attractively mordant characters delivering deadpan seriocomic monologues about philosophy and romance.\n\nWith \u201cNed Rifle,\u201d Hartley brings to a close the family saga begun in his biggest hit, \u201cHenry Fool\u201d (1997), and continued in the fairly bewildering \u201cFay Grim\u201d (2006). The new film is a return to form after that sagging midsection, and the coterie of Hartley admirers still paying attention will find frustrations, rewards, a few darkly intelligent laughs, and an ending that unexpectedly haunts.\n\nAdded bonus: more stuff for Aubrey Plaza to do. As the latest recruit to Hartley-land, the \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d star seems born to the mannerisms, and her way with a fetching glower fits right in. When \u201cNed Rifle\u201d opens, Fay Grim (Parker Posey) is still serving a life sentence on a framed-up terrorism charge (don\u2019t ask), and her 18-year-old son, Ned (Liam Aiken), has emerged from witness protection with a profound belief in God and a burning anger toward Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), the reprobate father he never met. Bidding farewell to his Reverend foster father (Hartley regular Martin Donovan), Ned packs a Bible and a gun and sets out to make amends.\n\nFirst, he has to visit his Uncle Simon (James Urbaniak), the onetime garbage man turned prize-winning poet-reclusive literary legend of \u201cHenry Fool.\u201d Fame is wearing on Simon, who has started a stand-up comedy video blog out of boredom; it\u2019s pretty terrible. Pointing his nephew in the direction of Seattle, he also inadvertently throws Ned together with Susan (Plaza), a possibly unhinged graduate student-stalker whose secrets involving the other characters take most of the movie to surface.\n\nFor all that, you probably don\u2019t need to have seen the first two movies to get on this one\u2019s offbeat road-movie wavelength. Aiken, who was 7 when \u201cHenry Fool\u201d was made, has aged into a lean, charismatic center of stillness, and you want to see Ned come out all right if only to make good on the actor\u2019s two-decade investment. He and Plaza make an arresting team, the child of God and the damaged sexpot, and it\u2019s fascinating (if a little bizarre) to see the actress push her gloomy persona into more erotic territory. \u201cNed Rifle\u201d isn\u2019t Plaza\u2019s break-out role \u2014 that was \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d in 2012 \u2014 but it does indicate that she\u2019s more than the Millennial Eeyore ing\u00e9nue she can be typed as.\n\nThe movie gets a real lift when Ned and Susan finally track down Henry Fool, who\u2019s being held against his will in a pharmacological mental institution after drug experiments have convinced him he\u2019s Satan. (This qualifies as a normal development in a Hal Hartley movie.) As before, Ryan breaks through the glass wall of the film\u2019s style with energetic cynicism; Henry is a Bukowski bad boy whose acid brilliance shines only in person, never on paper.\n\nPosey is in only a handful of scenes, which is fine: Stiff and unconvincing, she seems to have lost interest in her character. Can you blame her? I\u2019m not sure what Hartley\u2019s larger game plan is, other than to explore the way sins ricochet and deepen through a family over the years. The tension in his movies comes from the collision of hot emotions and cool behavior; the filmmaking is deadpan, too, as though Jim Jarmusch had gotten stranded in Middle America.\n\nBut Hartley lacks Jarmusch\u2019s visual invention, not to mention his interest in a world outside his characters. At its worst, \u201cNed Rifle\u201d is a self-involved movie about self-involved people. When it clicks, though, we\u2019re in a pared-down moral universe that carries unsettling echoes of our own.",

        "text": "LEVERETT \u2014 When people think of the Massachusetts tech economy, they probably don\u2019t think of this town of 1,900 built into the woods about 10 miles north of Amherst.\n\nSince April, this Western Massachusetts community has steadily connected homes, businesses, and town offices to a municipal fiber-optic network offering broadband services that have long bypassed this part of the state.\n\nToday, software developer Al Nutile can video-conference and write code simultaneously with a project team scattered across three continents from his hillside home.\n\nCarter Wall, who lives on a dirt road, can download big data files from the solar power installations she monitors. At the local cafe, people can bring iPads and get blazing-fast Wi-Fi instead of waiting their turn to surf the net at a dusty, old desktop with a satellite connection that cuts out in bad weather.\n\nBy the end of this month, Leverett will have linked every home in town to broadband. Nearby communities are not far behind in bringing broadband to their residents; they see high-speed Internet as an economic boon akin to rural electrification in the 1930s, one that could bring higher home values, better business climates, and easier access to the modern economy.\n\nThese new connections are the culmination of an eight-year, $90 million effort by the state to build a \u201cbackbone\u201d of fiber-optic data transmission lines across Western Massachusetts.\n\nThe network, financed with state and federal stimulus money, will extend broadband to 45 isolated towns where 40 percent of homes have no Internet access and the rest are relegated to dial-up, DSL, and satellite connections operating at a fraction of speeds available in Eastern Massachusetts.\n\nState and federal economic development officials view access to high-speed Internet as a way to boost rural economies, where traditional industries such as farming, forestry, and paper making have declined, and connect them to 21st-century services, such as online education and telemedicine.\n\nWith private telecommunication companies unable to profitably extend their networks to sparsely populated areas, state, federal, and local governments have stepped in.\n\nIn Leverett, for example, voters in 2012 approved borrowing $3.6 million \u2014 nearly $1,900 per resident \u2014 for the town to lay fiber lines to 800 premises and connect to the main trunk built by the state.\n\n\u201cMore and more communities understand that high-speed wired Internet access represents critical infrastructure right up there with telephone and roads,\u201d said David Talbot, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. \u201cCommunity networks are often seen as a way to advance economic development, attract high-tech businesses, cut municipal costs, and bring competition to the market.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Broadband Institute, a quasi-public agency overseeing the Western Massachusetts project, estimates that completing the so-called last mile of fiber that connects end users will cost an additional $112 million. About $50 million will be funded by the state, and the rest from local funds.\n\nAbout 32 towns have banded together in a group called Wired West, which is working with the broadband institute to build and operate fiber lines to individual buildings.\n\nIn recent months, about 19 of Wired West\u2019s towns have approved borrowing a total of $30 million, according to Monica Webb, chairwoman of the collaborative. About five more will vote in few months, she said. All the local funding must be approved by June 2016 to qualify for state money.\n\nBefore construction starts in each town, 40 percent of its residents must sign up for service, which starts at $49 a month for speeds similar to Comcast\u2019s basic offering in Boston and rises to $109 for a version that is 40 times faster.\n\nWhen the fiber networks are completed in the next two to five years, the towns will own them and Wired West, a municipally owned entity, will operate them.\n\nLeverett has contracted a private company to provide Internet service, which will cost subscribers $65 a month. That\u2019s about same as Comcast and Verizon FIOS customers pay in Greater Boston, but the speeds in Leverett are about 10 times faster.\n\nResidents already are witnessing the economic potential of broadband.\n\nNow that her Leverett home is hooked up to the fiber network, Wall has sold her house in Medford, where she lived half the time because her job as a solar energy consultant often required higher speeds than she could get in Leverett.\n\nShe\u2019s taking the $170,000 gain she made from the sale and splitting it between her retirement fund and a nonprofit she recently cofounded, the Future Face of American Energy, which will match women and people of color with internships in the energy industry.\n\nIn New Marlborough, a Wired West town, filmmaker Douglas Trumbull has already hooked up to the fiber backbone, paying the cost of laying fiber from his studio.\n\nTrumbull is developing a high-resolution, high-frame-rate-viewing technology called Magi, which has required him to build his own server farm to process the images and send hard drives in the mail to studios and other clients because Internet connections were too slow.\n\nHe now expects to cut his costs by using cloud computing services to produce and share video.\n\nGerald Jones, the owner of Jones Group Realtors in Amherst, sells houses in the communities targeted by the state\u2019s broadband initiative.\n\nHe said he has given financial support to the broadband committee in Shutesbury and his agents have advised clients in Shutesbury and elsewhere to vote in support of building the networks.\n\nHe said a growing number of homebuyers refuse to consider properties that can\u2019t get high-speed Internet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten more and more important as time has gone on,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you had a town with no school system and you were trying to sell a house to someone with kids.\u201d\n\nThe completion of the broadband \u201cbackbone\u201d may also spur private investment.\n\nAdam Chait, the owner of a small Internet service provider in Monterey, in the southwest corner of the state, said he is raising money to build a network connecting 1,000 homes in Berkshire County as a test to show that private companies can profitably serve remote areas.\n\nHe declined to estimate how much he\u2019ll need.\n\nLocal officials admit the work of building broadband networks has been complicated, and some benefits, such as new businesses, could take years to appear.\n\nLeverett has created Web pages and information packets to help educate residents about key parts of their new system.\n\nEric Nakajima, the head of the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, said his group\u2019s priority is making sure that towns\u2019 broadband systems were well-maintained and won\u2019t run out of money.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely early days,\u201d Nakajima said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a test case right now in the region or in the state where we can look and say, \u2018Let\u2019s evaluate.\u2019 \u201d",

        "text": "On the outskirts of a busy port city lies a university campus that looks a lot like a scene from the British Midlands. Students in hoodies and headphones wearing thick, rectangle-rimmed glasses discuss \u2018critical thinking\u2019 and on sunny days sit crossed-legged on the grass by a lake as construction dust blows in the wind.\n\nBut some of these students have never liked a Facebook message or sent a friend request. They send tweets on Weibo not Twitter and upload photos on Weixin not Instagram.\n\nWelcome to Ningbo in China, Northern Zhenjiang province, five thousand miles away from the UK.\n\nEvery international business in the world, from textiles to technology, is trying to access the Chinese market. The education business is no different.\n\nNingbo is famous for its entrepreneurs and foreign investment. For the last 10 years it has also been home to Nottingham Ningbo (UNNC) a satellite campus of Nottingham University.\n\nThe campus is a partnership between the University of Nottingham UK and the Wanli Education group, a Chinese state-owned company. Staffed with both Chinese and international academics, it is sold as a genuine UK university experience in China.\n\nThis new fleet of universities is part of China\u2019s big ambition to become a world powerhouse for education \u2013 for students from San Francisco to Shanghai.\n\nForeign institutions are falling over themselves to set up partnerships with Chinese universities - from cooperation projects to creating campuses that mirror their own in Chinese cities. For international universities this provides an opportunity to get a foothold in a country already obsessed with education. And more importantly for the students, for future business leaders in particular, it offers an insight into a marketplace that still proves elusive for international companies.\n\n\"I think being immersed in the country changes your sense of the reality of it, \u201csaid Joseph Healey, a Scottish banker in his early 50s who took a masters degree at UNNC after serving as a senior executive at the National Australia Bank. \u201cI spent over 10 years discussing China with leaders in business [outside of China] and a big part of the problem is that we have a shallow understanding of the complexity of this country. So it is no surprise that so many businesses have failed.\u201d\n\nNew York University, John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and Liverpool University, among others, have all set up campuses in China.\n\nMeanwhile the Chinese government is pouring money in to transforming its education sector: in the last decade alone it quadrupled its number of annual university graduates. The country has also become the world's largest exporter of students, with nearly as many Chinese students studying for postgraduate degrees in England as there are Brits.\n\nIt now ranks 3rd in the world's most popular places for international study, behind only the UK and America, and is expected to attract more than half a million international students by 2020 studying degrees and study abroad programmes, according to the US-based Institute of International Education\u2019s Project Atlas.\n\nBut this huge expansion is not without its problems: there have been concerns over academic integrity at some institutions. In July 2012 Yale cancelled its programme at Peking University. The American Ivy League university allegedly blamed its decision on lower than expected interest in its courses. But its programme also faced controversy. In 2007 a biology professor openly criticised administrators for tolerating alleged widespread plagiarism amongst Chinese students.\n\nInternational campuses like UNNC face a unique set of difficulties. Administrators must try to ensure a high standard of education and academic freedom in a country where politics can interfere in everything. In January, China's education minister vowed to ban university text books that promote 'Western values\u2019, sparking widespread concern in Western educational circles.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Education has promised to provide foreign universities with the same freedoms they enjoy in their home countries. But the institutions must also comply with Chinese rules and regulations which means studying of Marxism is compulsory for Chinese students, for example, but not for international students.\n\nAnd China's strict control of the internet also means that some foreign-based websites such as Google Scholar, a search engine which indexes scholarly literature across formats and topics, is blocked in the country. Researchers must use virtual private networks (VPN) in order to use such services.\n\nThere are other practical difficulties. While seminars are taught in English, many international students find themselves in classes where the majority of their classmates are not native English speakers. And this can create some significant obstacles.\n\n\u201cMostly, Chinese students in class don't participate. Back home when you know you are right you tell the lecturer,\u201d said Ella Appiah a 20-year-old student from Ghana studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree in International Communications at UNNC.\n\nThat might be more a product of cultural norms than any language barriers, said Amir Emamizadeh, a 19-year-old British student at UNNC. \u201cChinese students struggle in group activities as they don't have experience in that at high school,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough to be sure for many of the students the advantages of being immersed in China far outweigh any of the difficulties. Students point out that being part of a rapidly changing society has significant advantages for their studies, in particular case work.\n\n\"As a global health student I feel that I have the advantage of studying in a country that gives me a first-hand experience in global health challenges in the 21st century. We have the chance to have field visits to different parts of China where we experience first-hand important health issues,\" said Kennedy Opondo, a 26-year-old Kenyan studying at the school.\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

        "text": "With Jane (Jaimie Alexander) in a state of near-constant panic over her identity, Dr. Borden (Ukweli Roach) administers a Rorschach test. But all Jane's got is the memory of weapons training in the woods with the ruggedly handsome man. Meanwhile, Weller (Sullivan Stapleton) has breakfast with his sister Sarah and her son Sawyer, who have moved in while looking for an apartment. Sarah mentions their father called to ask if they're attending Taylor's yearly memorial? Weller is definitely not interested. At work, he tells Patterson (Ashley Johnson) that he noticed a scar on the back of Jane's neck. Then he runs Jane through more weapons training, hoping to trigger another memory. One thing's for sure: Jane knows her guns, and she now remembers shooting a nun in the back of the head. Stunned, she refrains from telling Weller, just as word arrives that Chao is dead of a massive stroke. Surveillance footage shows a man walking away from Chao's room as everyone else rushes toward it... Suddenly, Patterson announces that she's decoded a Vigen\u00e8re cipher on Jane's neck: Maj. Arthur Gibson - a Silver Star-awarded pilot, who once injured, left a desk job in Nevada to work for the Air Force in New York. Convinced Gibson may know something about her, Jane insists on accompanying the team to his home in Brooklyn. Refusing to talk, Gibson orders the team off his property. As they head back to their SUV, Gibson's house explodes.\n\nThe only thing that survives the explosion is a wall safe - no sign of Gibson. The team questions Air Force Colonel Margaret Powers, who explains that after experiencing collateral damage on a mission, Gibson's increasing paranoia and PTSD earned him a desk job and, ultimately, a discharge. But after reviewing Gibson's files, Patterson finds that not only did the Air Force not fire Gibson, they promoted him - and gave him top security clearance. Weller figures the Air Force made Gibson a drone pilot, which means there must be a drone program in New York. Meanwhile, Gibson kidnaps Emily, the six-year-old daughter of his co-worker Alex, in order to force his assistance in launching an armed drone. Moments later, the drone drops a missile on Colonel Powers as she's getting into her SUV. Frustrated, Reade (Rob Brown) wonders whether Jane and her tattoos are to blame. Weller insists it's not Jane's fault; they need to focus on finding Gibson.\n\nFurious, Mayfair (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) calls General Fitzmorris, who admits Gibson worked for a secret domestic drone surveillance program, and the drone he now controls is armed with two more missiles. Distraught over the general's disregard for Emily's welfare, Weller blows up, so Mayfair orders him to stand down. While Reade speculates that whoever tattooed Jane knew about the drone program, Jane flashes back to shooting the nun. Maybe her tattoos are some kind of penance? Mayfair pulls Weller aside, to chastise him for yelling at Fitzmorris. Weller admits he's been thinking about Taylor, who went missing 25 years ago when he was 10. In his last memory of her, Taylor fell while climbing a tree, leaving a scar on the back of her neck - the same scar as Jane's. Weller knows why his name is on Jane's back: Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw.\n\nPaterson cracks Gibson's safe, finding an air-gapped laptop with a list of five seemingly unrelated domestic accidents - yet the victims of each incident were all from the Middle East. Gibson's initials are associated with three, the initials I.M. with the other two. Patterson thinks I.M. is Major Ivon Musgrave, so the team scrambles to his Brooklyn apartment. When Musgrave runs, Jane gives chase. An intense fight ensues, until Weller intervenes, hauling Musgrave onto the street. Musgrave demands to talk to Colonel Powers, just as Jane spies the man from her memory. That's when the second missile hits, blowing the team back into the apartment building. Jane rushes to help an injured Reade, then stumbles back to the street, but the man from her flashback is gone. Back at HQ, Musgrave explains that Gibson wanted to expose the drone program, which was rife with collateral damage. When he asked for help, Musgrave turned him in, then helped the Air Force destroy Gibson's life. Since Gibson has one missile left and is dead set on destroying the program, Weller asks Fitzmorris where the drone pilots work from... and it's the top three floors of the building they're in. Twice a day, every pilot is in the building for a shift change, which is in one hour.\n\nAs the building evacuation begins, Patterson narrows Gibson's location to one of two construction sites in Brooklyn. On the way, Jane tells Weller that she did remember something... what if she's a terrible person? Insisting Jane has a good heart, Weller leaves her in the car, then runs to check the roof. After a firefight, Gibson takes the elevator down as Weller tries and fails to warn Jane. Gibson open fires on the SUV, then drives off, so Jane decides to follow, forcing a crash and rolling her own car, which brings on another flashback. The nun is actually a soldier in disguise. After the shooting, Jane pulls a coded USB fob from around his neck. After pulling a woozy Jane out of the SUV, Weller extracts Emily's location from Gibson and returns the little girl to her father.\n\nBack at HQ, the team argues about the day's events. The Air Force has already come up with a cover story for the press, and Reade isn't convinced Jane's tattoo saved thousands of lives. Mayfair pulls Weller aside to advise that Patterson is running DNA tests to confirm whether Jane truly is Taylor. But Weller doesn't need test results - even if he's not ready to tell Jane. That night, he runs his theory by his sister. Stunned, Sarah reviews how this could change all their lives: their father was accused of kidnapping and killing Taylor, causing their mother to leave. Weller has spent the last 25 years believing his father murdered Taylor... and now their father is dying of pancreatic cancer. Soon. Across town, Jane is surveying the dismal contents of her safe house refrigerator when someone grabs her from behind... the ruggedly handsome man.",

        "text": "Mrs. Clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before California holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party\u2019s nomination. But in choosing to raise concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy stances, she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a Trump presidency.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal Democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances, her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering Republicans to support her this fall.\n\nRoughly 21 percent of independent voters and 32 percent of Republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security, compared with 16 percent of Democrats, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll conducted last month. At the same time, 61 percent of registered voters said a Trump presidency would make America\u2019s image in the world worse, according to the latest New York Times-CBS News poll.\n\n\u201cThere are many Republicans concerned about this,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, an American ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration who also served on Bill Clinton\u2019s National Security Council, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThey find his policy positions beyond the pale, and they\u2019re also turned off by his vulgarity.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the Clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate Republicans who could endorse Mrs. Clinton, largely making the case for foreign policy sure-footedness.\n\nThose calls have included to an aide of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and to Nicholas F. Brady, who served as secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, with plans to reach out to James A. Baker III, a White House chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state under President George Bush.\n\nIn her debates with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions, including urging the Obama administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which she later said was a mistake.\n\nDonald J. Trump told a crowd in Sacramento that NATO states and other allies should be paying the United States compensation for all the U.S. has done for them.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. \u201cBernie Sanders said it and I\u2019m going to use it all over the place because it\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe is a woman who is ill-suited to be president because she has bad judgment.\u201d\n\nAs each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the Oval Office, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are preparing to make a case against Mr. Trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the campaign against McCain or Romney, which was two competing visions,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former White House and Pentagon official under President Obama.\n\nInstead, he said, Mrs. Clinton will remind voters that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un have expressed support for Mr. Trump, who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with Mr. Kim, a pariah worldwide.\n\nMrs. Clinton will also accuse Mr. Trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of American diplomacy that every president has adhered to since World War II.\n\nJulianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the Brussels-based coalition of European nations. Mrs. Clinton, she added, needed to explain to voters that \u201cevery single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances\u201d and that \u201cplaying by the rules makes sense for all of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was \u201cfraudulent\u201d in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions, explaining that he supported global alliances, but believed that the United States should shoulder less of the financial burden.\n\n\u201cOur country can\u2019t afford to protect the world anymore, and at least not get reimbursed for it,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the American-led operation to defeat the Islamic State, ending the economic embargo against Cuba, and pledging unwavering support of Israel.\n\nAnd she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201creckless actions\u201d on foreign policy.\n\nThe San Diego speech, to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when Mr. Trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans\u2019 groups, will present a more sweeping \u2014 and fearsome \u2014 portrayal of Mr. Trump, one that the Clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cThis is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose, not individual policy proposals.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers, who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call for a no-fly zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to Europe. But Mr. Trump, in addressing foreign policy, has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters\u2019 emotional concerns that America has lost its standing in the world.\n\n\u201cYou do get the sense that he\u2019s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate \u2014 and I consider it a minority \u2014 that couldn\u2019t be less interested in facts or realities,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways.\u201d",

The GOP front-runner proposes tax cuts across all income levels, and slashing taxes for those making up to $50,000.\n\n\"With Trump, of course, it's going to benefit the wealthy the most, so as you go up, your paycheck will increase drastically, which would benefit him as well,\" Cole explained on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday.\n\nBut this comes at a cost -- a $9.5 trillion federal deficit over the next decade, which would require drastic reductions in federal spending to help pay for the tax breaks.\n\nRepublican rival Ted Cruz's tax plan would also result in an enormous federal deficit: an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Cruz's plan is the \"most creative,\" Cole said, and would reform the current 750,000-page tax code for a flat tax rate of 10 percent across all incomes.\n\nCruz's plan would also benefit the wealthy most, even more so than Trump's, Cole said. As for the middle class, paychecks may increase by about 50 dollars, according to the International Business Times analysis.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders would also raise the federal deficit with his tax plan, which Cole said was \"more extreme\" than Trump's. The senator vows to raise taxes regardless of your income, with the highest earners paying over 40 percent, for a \"trade off\" for funding free government programs, including college and health care.\n\n\"Unless you need health care, then Bernie Sanders is not going to do a lot for you,\" Cole said.\n\nBut if you want to keep things as they are, Cole said Clinton is your choice. Most Americans can expect the same taxes, and only those making over one million dollars would face an increase. For those making $5 million and over, Clinton plans to add a four percent surtax.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton is very status quo.

        "text": "The man behind the Bastille Day truck attack that killed at least 84 people in Nice had recently been radicalised, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says.\n\nThursday night's attack in the Riviera city of Nice plunged France into new grief and fear just eight months after gunmen killed 130 people in Paris. Those attacks, and one in Brussels four months ago, shocked Western Europe, already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration, open borders and pockets of Islamist radicalism.\n\nAuthorities are yet to produce evidence 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, shot dead by police, had any links to Islamic State, which claimed the attack, but Valls said there was no doubt on the assailant's motives.\n\n\"The investigation will establish the facts, but we know now that the killer was radicalised very quickly,\" Valls said in an interview with Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.\n\n\"The claim on Saturday morning by Islamic State and the fast radicalisation of the killer confirms the Islamist nature of this attack.\"\n\nOfficials said on Saturday that people questioned by police had indicated that he had undergone a rapid transformation from someone with no apparent interest in religion.\n\nRelatives and friends interviewed in Nice painted a picture of a man who at least until recently drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and according to French media even ate pork, behaviour that would be unlikely in a devout Muslim.\n\nSpeaking from his home town in Tunisia, Bouhlel's sister told Reuters he had been having psychological problems when he left for France in 2005 and had sought medical treatment.\n\nAs authorities were trying to better understand his motives, two more people, a man and a woman close to Bouhlel, were arrested in Nice early on Sunday, bringing the number of people in detention over the killings to seven.\n\nThe Amaq news agency affiliated with the militant Islamist group said that Bouhlel \"was one of the soldiers of Islamic State\".\n\nValls, who said security services had prevented 16 attacks over three years, indicated that at play on Thursday was the group's modus operandi of cajoling unstable individuals into carrying out attacks with whatever means possible.\n\n\"Daesh gives unstable individuals an ideological kit that allows them to make sense of their acts ... this is probably what happened in Nice's case,\" Valls said, referring to the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.\n\nThe group, which is under military pressure from forces opposed to it, considers France its main target given its military operations in the Middle East, and also because it is easier to strike than the United States, which is leading a coalition against it.\n\nDespite mounting criticism from the conservative opposition and far right over how President Francois Hollande's Socialist government is handling security, Valls said there was no risk zero and new attacks would occur.\n\n\"I've always said the truth regarding terrorism: there is an ongoing war, there will be more attacks. It's difficult to say, but other lives will be lost.\"\n\nWith presidential and parliamentary elections less than a year away, French opposition politicians are increasing pressure and seizing on what they described as security failings that made it possible for the truck to career 2km through large crowds before it was finally halted.\n\nAfter Thursday's attack, a state of emergency imposed across France after the November attacks in Paris was extended by three months.",

        "text": "It's been a good week for women in architecture in general, except for one female architect in particular.\n\nIn the first instance, the Architect's Journal announced the finalists for its inaugural Women in Architecture awards. The magazine's recent championing of female architects, and highlighting of inequalities within the profession, is commendable. Among its findings was that the proportion of female architectural staff in the UK has actually declined since 2009, from 28% to 21% \u2013 this despite the proportion of female architecture students being roughly 50%. That work-life balance is evidently hard to strike in a profession many say is still inherently masculine, with its long apprenticeship, long working hours, and emphasis on competition rather than collaboration. No wonder they've called it the WAA \u2013 it sounds like a cry of despair, doesn't it?\n\nThe shortlists aren't too depressing, though. Eight women are up for the award, including Amanda Levete (formerly of Future Systems, doing well on her own), Roisin Heneghan (of Heneghan Peng, designers of the new London Olympics footbridge) and Sarah Wigglesworth (whose fine Sandal Magna primary school gained her a lot of attention last year). There's also an award for emerging woman architect of the year. The prizes are announced on 20 April. There's a nice (if confusingly Anglo-American) infographic on women in architecture here, by the way.\n\nThe woman for whom it has not been such a great week is the first female architect most people would name: Zaha Hadid. She's up for the WAA as well, but first she lost out on the competition to design the prestigious new Bauhaus Museum in Weimer, Germany, for which she was the only British architect in contention. Her absence was conspicuous, too, when it came to another architecture award: the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) announced the 23-strong shortlist for its inaugural national awards this week, and Zaha's Glasgow Riverside Museum for Transport isn't on it, despite being surely the highest-profile new building in Scotland of the past year. It wasn't a unanimously popular project, but its omission has baffled even its critics. Was it because Zaha has won the Stirling prize for two years running? Has she just become too big?\n\nHadid can at least take consolation from her inclusion in the V&A's new exhibition on British design, which opens today. The exhibition's architecture component includes a model of her Aquatics Centre, the only female-designed building in the show, as far as I could see. There are plenty of the usual architectural suspects here: the postwar Festival of Britain generation; Basil Spence; Denys Lasdun; big models of Foster's Gherkin and Rogers's Lloyds building.\n\nOne discovery for me was John Prizeman, about whom I'd known very little. He was an accomplished writer, and his work mainly focused on domestic interiors, particularly kitchens. There are illustrations of two small designs by him that caught my eye. One was his \"Soft-Tech House for the 1980s\" \u2013 an evocative, late-70s vision of \"the future\" that looks like a cross between Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House and a sort of Hobbit-style eco-dwelling. It's somehow simultaneously quaint and ahead of its time.\n\nThe other, particularly pertinent in the context of women in architecture, is a cutaway illustration of a neat, compact family home Prizeman designed in 1959. It's bracingly modern, with fitted kitchens, free-flowing living areas and a new Mini in the garage, though its name wasn't exactly progressive: it's called Her House. It says it all that the woman in Prizeman's dream home is depicted bustling around indoors; the man is lounging on the back terrace.\n\nFinally, another new discovery this week was Architects of Invention, a practice that not only has one of the best names in the business but looks to be living up to it. It is headed by Niko Japaridze, a former senior architect at Rem Koolhaas's OMA, who has worked in the UK and also has offices in his native Georgia. Last year, the firm wove a snaking wooden staircase through the new headquarters it designed for Georgia's National Olympic Committee, and has recently finished an imposing new building in Tbilisi with an imposing name: The Prosecutor's Office. It looks like a giant black filing cabinet, with square, glass rooms projecting out like half-opened drawers. Seventy per cent of the building is hung off the ground. The interior is just as startling \u2013 its long central staircase with green glass walls looks like something out of The Matrix. Japaridze has a host of other promising-looking buildings going up in Georgia. He also claims to be Tbilisi's one millionth citizen. One to watch.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2012. The original misspelled the names of Roisin Heneghan and Heneghan Peng architects as Roisin Peneghan of Peneghan Heng. This has been corrected.",

But that was the case a mere couple of decades ago, before both began featuring violence, profanity, sex, and other material not appropriate for young children. Along the same lines, in recent times many other things long associated with kids are now being marketed to adult consumers. Here are a dozen examples:\n\nGummy Vitamins. A string of studies indicating that vitamins appear to be largely a waste of money has resulted in flat sales for the once sizzling vitamin market. It looks like consumers are getting the messages spread by researchers in the field, who point out that while vitamin supplements are correlated with better health, there is little proof of causality because the people taking vitamins tend to healthier and take better care of themselves in the first place. But if consumers are dubious about the benefits of boring old-fashioned vitamins, they appear less skeptical about vitamins \u201cdisguised as candy,\u201d a.k.a. gummy vitamins. Once popular only with children, colorful, chewable, sweet-tasting vitamins are now ubiquitous in stores\u2019 adult vitamin sections, and makers of such adult vitamins say that the category has been enjoying \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of late.\n\nWalt Disney World. In some ways, Disney World has always been marketed to adults\u2014who often say they enjoy \u201cfeeling like a kid\u201d while touring the theme parks sans children. Some even wish Disney would host child-free days when adults could hit the rides without having to deal with the young whippersnappers clogging up the parks. While that\u2019s highly unlikely to ever take place, Disney has taken several steps over the years to appeal to adult-only clientele, including the introduction of booze for sale at the Magic Kingdom, as well as special events like $35 \u201cAfter Hours\u201d party with alcohol and tasting menus, and, most recently, a $79 \u201cFood & Wine Late Night\u201d at EPCOT.\n\nPop Tarts. While interest in breakfast cereal has collapsed in recent years, sales of another kid favorite at the breakfast table, Pop Tarts, have risen each and every year for more than three decades straight. The Wall Street Journal noted that while Pop Tarts are most popular with teens and younger children, \u201cadults reach for them as a retro snack.\u201d It\u2019s not just nostalgia that\u2019s drawing adults to Pop Tarts, but that, \u201cShoppers increasingly want quick breakfasts they can eat with one hand on the go.\u201d Over the years, Pop Tarts and its imitators have periodically tried out products more directly marketed to adults and foodies, such as \u201cToaster Pastries\u201d in flavors like Cherry Pomegranate from Nature\u2019s Path.\n\nHappy Meals. McDonald\u2019s briefly tried to market a \u201cGo Active Happy Meal\u201d for adults a decade ago, with a salad and an exercise booklet instead of chicken nuggets and a plastic toy. It obviously didn\u2019t catch on\u2014very few healthy fast food items are successful\u2014but this fall, the Happy Meal for Adults concept is back, bizarrely, in the world of high fashion. Nordstrom is selling a series of pop culture-themed items from Moschino, including an iPhone case that looks like a McDonald\u2019s French fry container ($85) and a Happy Meal lookalike shoulder bag that retails for over $1,000.\n\nBackpacks. In what could be considered a sign that adults really don\u2019t want to grow up, backpack sales are up dramatically among consumers ages 18 and up\u2014including a 48% rise in backpack purchases by female adults over a recent time span. Valentino, Alexander McQueen, and Fendi are among the many fashion designers to feature posh leather and camouflage versions of the bag normally associated with high school and college kids, only theirs sometimes cost $2,000.\n\nLunchables. OK, so neither Kraft nor its Oscar Mayer brand actually markets Lunchables to adults. But the Adult Lunch Combos look eerily like Lunchables only without Oreos or Capri Sun, and everyone is referring to the new protein-packed prepared lunches as \u201cLunchables for Adults\u201d even though the real name is the Portable Protein Pack.\n\nObstacle Courses. Kids have playgrounds in town parks and schools. What do adults have to help keep them in shape while also having fun? The gym doesn\u2019t qualify because, for most people, working out is work, not fun. The exception is when the workout allows adults to swing, jump, get dirty, and challenge themselves on courses made specifically for them, like those on the popular TV show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d and on Tough Mudder and other extreme obstacle course races. This fall, Las Vegas is even hosting an \u201cAdult-Themed\u201d course where the obstacles have names like the Dominatrix Dungeon and the Blue Balls Dash.\n\nSugary Cereals. A big reason that cereal sales have dropped is that fewer kids are eating them for breakfast. Yet as parents try to sub in healthier fare as a replacement for kid-favorite sugary cereals, the cereal giants appear to be having some success reaching a different audience\u2014the parents themselves. Baby Boomers and Gen X, who grew up craving the sugar rush provided by a bowl of neon-colored goodies on Saturday mornings, are now being fed heaping doses of nostalgia, in the form of cartoon-character cereals brought back from the dead and other adult-focused marketing efforts. The fastest-growing consumers of Trix and Lucky Charms are, in fact, older adults.\n\nLegos. \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d was certainly clever and entertaining enough to warrant an adult audience, especially among those who grew up building with the bricks. Lately, Lego has been making another appeal to adults. Several Legoland Discovery Centers\u2014which normally attract families with children under the age of 10 or 12\u2014have been offering special Adult Nights, where all visitors must be 18 or over.\n\nFruit Roll-Ups. Many adults would probably be embarrassed if they were caught eating Fruit Roll-Ups, delicious though they may be. How can you avoid being kidded about your preference for what is a quintessential kid snack? Easy. Call them something more adult-sounding, such as Fruit Strips or Fruit Leather.\n\nHot Pockets. Last year, Nestle attempted to broaden the Hot Pocket demographic\u2014typically, teen boys and slacker college kids who don\u2019t want to cook or even order pizza\u2014by introducing gourmet versions featuring angus beef, hickory ham to appeal to adult foodies.\n\nHalloween. October 31 used to be about children trick-or-treating door to door in their neighborhoods. Now it\u2019s the centerpiece of a whole Halloween season where the kids are invited to enjoy only some\u2014but by no means all\u2014of the fun. A year ago, adults spent roughly $1.2 billion on costumes, compared to $1 billion spent on costumes for kids. Roughly 7 out of 10 college-aged adults plan on dressing up for Halloween, which explains the sales success of oddly \u201csexy\u201d costumes of pizza slices or corn fields. Or sexy nuns. Adults also tend to spend more on their costumes than they do on Halloween outfits for kids. So that explains why companies are marketing the holiday to adults more and more. Still, it\u2019s hard to come up with a good explanation for the existence of the Sexy Pizza Costume.",

        "text": "The Murdochs are still in crisis mode at Fox News. The network was rocked yet again on Friday, this time by a devastating article in New York magazine by Gabriel Sherman, who reported that Fox News paid a $3 million settlement to a booker who said Mr. Ailes carried on an abusive 20-year relationship with her \u2014 at times using company resources and personnel to facilitate it. Mr. Ailes denied the charges through his lawyer.\n\nIt immediately raised new questions about whether the Murdochs would be forced into a bigger house cleaning of Mr. Ailes\u2019s remaining team of lieutenants at Fox News, where, it seems, sexual harassment payouts were not followed by the recognition that there just might be a problem, let alone by any obvious attempts to aggressively address the corporate culture that facilitated the behavior in the first place.\n\nMr. Ailes\u2019s departure from the network leaves a huge vacuum in its own right. He drove it to pursue the stories that helped define the strife of the Clinton, Bush (No. 43) and Obama eras. He made it a TV headquarters for the patriotism-infused Bush war marketing effort; the false accusations that Mr. Obama was a \u201csocialist\u201d of dubious citizenship, and, most recently, the Trump movement.\n\nMr. Murdoch abided by it all, even when it conflicted with some of his own views, such as his support for a path to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants. But as often as not he seemed to be in line with Mr. Ailes, at least based on how he portrayed himself on Twitter \u2014 as a \u201cclimate change skeptic\u201d; as a fan of Dr. Ben Carson, \u201ca real black president who can properly address the racial divide\u201d; and as one who believes: \u201cMaybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.\u201d\n\nThough executives who have worked with Lachlan Murdoch say they assume he shares some of his father\u2019s conservatism, they also say he does not readily advertise his views, which is in itself a major departure from the elder Murdoch.\n\nAs for James Murdoch, his leanings are in plainer view than his brother\u2019s, and they are decidedly different from his father\u2019s (with an important exception, friends say: free-market fiscal policy).\n\nJames Murdoch\u2019s wife, Kathryn, is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund and a former director at the Clinton Climate Initiative. The couple started Quadrivium, a foundation that focuses on the \u201csustainable use of resources\u201d and \u201cscientific understanding.\u201d James has spearheaded initiatives to make the company \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d\n\nIn an essay in Time magazine in December, he wrote, \u201cEntrenched and compromised interests spin the fiction that science is more divided than united, and they sow seeds of uncertainty on issues of unquestionable priority: namely, the survival of our species on this planet.\u201d\n\nHis views have heartened producers and executives at National Geographic, which 21st Century Fox took greater control of last year.\n\nFox News\u2019s reporting often tells a much different story. Its hosts don\u2019t hesitate to report that \u201cthe science is still in question,\u201d as Heather Childers recently did, or that warnings about climate change are emanating from \u201cpeople aligned with the political left in the scientific community,\u201d as the host Steve Doocy said in April while promoting a film purporting to debunk climate change.\n\nEven before Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster, climate activists were hopeful that James Murdoch would force changes to skeptical coverage of climate change at Fox News, as well as its corporate cousin The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page has great sway with congressional Republicans.\n\nTo nudge it along, one group, Partnership for Responsible Growth, has run ads with both outlets reminding Republicans that their leaders used to support market-based solutions to climate change \u2014 and calling on The Journal\u2019s editorial page to acknowledge humankind\u2019s role.\n\nDavid Fenton, a longtime strategist for progressive causes whose agency, Fenton, made the ads, said its main goal was to push a bipartisan solution in the form of a carbon pricing system. The Murdoch outlets have been standing in the way, he said, by creating a \u201cfalse reality bubble denying science\u201d that scares amenable Republican politicians away from the cause.\n\n\u201cJames knows better, and there\u2019s no way that someone like that could be happy with the terribly negative role the Murdoch properties have played in slowing bipartisan action on climate,\u201d Mr. Fenton said.\n\nNone of the Murdochs would comment for this column.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to talk about the intersection of their political and business interests without lingering for a moment on the latter. Even if some of Fox News\u2019s programming drives one or both of the brothers bananas, it is still a major cash generator for 21st Century Fox, with $1.6 billion in operating profit in fiscal 2015, according to Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.\n\nFox News\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre was to fill a void that conservative-leaning viewers sensed in the mainstream media. That guiding philosophy has provided a steady compass, and a lucrative revenue stream, as its competitors have struggled with their own paths.\n\nThat could provide a strong argument against drastic change, especially for the elder Mr. Murdoch, who is by all accounts enjoying his new role running the network and is saying he won\u2019t rush into picking a successor to Mr. Ailes. It seems a near certainty that he will stay through the election.\n\nWith Mr. Murdoch at the helm, the network covered Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention in Philadelphia with all the skepticism you\u2019d expect. It didn\u2019t show the speech of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a fallen American soldier. Then, there was Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s aside that the slaves who built the White House, whom Michelle Obama referred to in her prime-time address, were \u201cwell fed\u201d and adequately housed.\n\nThat said, Fox News\u2019s audience tends to be older, which is why executives there indicate that the family views its younger prime-time star, Megyn Kelly, as an important part of its future. Her appeal extends to the core Fox News viewer as well as to those with more mainstream news tastes.\n\nMs. Kelly\u2019s contract, like Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, comes up for renewal next year. Before Mr. Ailes left, Ms. Kelly seemed certain to leave. Now it\u2019s a given that her decision will depend on how the Murdochs decide to proceed \u2014 as will so, so much else.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 1, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: With Ailes Out, and Murdoch In, What\u2019s Next at Fox News?.

        "text": "A couple of experts have just been on the radio warning against a dangerous growth in addictive behaviour among adults in western societies, much of it including internet gambling, porn and gaming, deliberately designed to be so. At the same time the Daily Beast is reporting excitedly that other experts are telling us not to drink more than three glasses of wine a week.\n\nYes, that's not a misprint. Clever chaps at Oxford University have concluded that the optimum intake of alcohol to dent booze-related deaths should be around 5g a day \u2013 that's slightly more than half a \"unit\" (8g) as currently defined, half of one (125ml) small scotch, half a half pint of beer, half a mean glass of red wine.\n\nMuddled messages here? You bet. The experts who complain about the commercial fostering of dirty habits are surely right. It's obvious to anyone who has watched a small child adeptly playing on an iPad, a teenager \u2013 including those of 35 \u2013 game-playing on a PC screen, let alone a harassed housewife getting past the chocolate and junk food in the queue for the supermarket till.\n\nBut half a glass of wine a day, what my father's generation would have dismissed as merely a dirty glass? As the saying goes, that sounds like a cure worse than the lurking diseases, public policy with little credibility which both contradicts other research that says that moderate drinking is good for most people \u2013 and undermines the Department of Health's (DH) official guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines have themselves been shrinking safe drinking for years. Twenty-eight units a week for men? Or 21? Twenty-one for women \u2013 or 14? The DH has changed its mind. What's more the number of units in a bottle of wine or scotch seems to be changing too. Ah well, say the puritans, the stuff's getting stronger. They say that about pot, too.\n\nTobacco? Well, that's more straightforward and is more a matter of liberty \u2013 the right to sell a legal (and tax-lucrative) substance using lawfully owned brand labels \u2013 than of health. Andrew Lansley is surely more right than wrong (I don't say this every week) to argue that alcohol, even crisps in moderation, are OK, but that in health terms the potential damage in tobacco always outweighs the pleasure of the drag.\n\nBy coincidence, the papers also contain warnings from the Health Protection Agency that sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise again among those young people not totally addicted to Grand Theft Auto. Charities rush to blame government cuts in the health education budget \u2013 they would, wouldn't they? \u2013 though it's not father-of-five Lansley who is not taking the precautions that put young people at risk. It's the young people \u2013 and we all remember why. It didn't seem important at the time.\n\nThe cost of all these bad lifestyle choices is considerable, both in terms of the battered NHS budget and the misery it causes, ill-health, premature death, infertility, domestic violence. Yet we struggle to get a handle on it. On one page of the Daily Beast, people who should know better complain that the nanny state interferes too much in our lives, on the next it demands more intervention to protect us from risks that most adults should be sensible enough to evaluate without having to be told.\n\nThe struggle between liberty and 'elf 'n' safety is beautifully illustrated by Thursday's Guardian report about the German climber on Everest who took that now-famous shot of the traffic jam of those mostly romantic amateurs (one carrying his bike) queuing to try to climb the world's highest mountain. Some will die, he thought sadly, and four later did. Lethal places mountains, even for the experts.\n\nYet the German climber, Ralf Dujmovits, encountered what he called \"an overweight French journalist\" \u2013 a woman weighing 80kg \u2013 who had used up all her oxygen long before she had reached the point where a proper climber would need it. Who let her climb? Who sold her the oxygen? It's not a self-regarding action that merely puts her own life at risk. Mountains aren't like that. Climbers are roped.\n\nFast-forward to the Oxford report. Yes, we know that booze can kill and maim. We can see that every day \u2013 though in Fleet Street and Westminster I see rather less of it than I once did and admit to slightly mixed feelings: it was so much more fun in the old days before the new puritanism took hold, a puritanism that is, incidentally, hedonistic in its own way.\n\nBut I can't believe any good is served for scientists to step in at a time when governments in London and Edinburgh are grappling with the most effective model of unit pricing (how to target the winos' tipple without being unfair to the sober poor) and suggest that virtual teetotalism is the answer. It just defies belief and as such is bad policy. My oldest friend still drinks four or five proper units a day every day \u2013 and he's pushing 85.",

        "text": "DALLAS -- The day after five Dallas officers were killed by a sniper, the city\u2019s police chief described the men as \u201cguardians\u201d of democracy, praising them for protecting the freedom to protest at a large demonstration against police brutality.\n\nPresident Barack Obama later eulogized the slain officers, saying they died while defending essential constitutional rights.\n\nBut nearly two months after the shootings, Dallas police have moved to silence critics and squelch lingering questions about the attack. Officers in riot gear have been told to ticket protesters who block or disrupt traffic, and Police Chief David Brown has refused to meet with demonstrators unless they agree to end their marches through downtown, which he says pose a threat to officers.\n\nAuthorities have also refused to release even the most basic information about the slayings, including any details about the weapons used, the autopsy findings and ballistics tests that could establish whether any officers were hit by friendly fire. Police have indicated that such information could be withheld almost indefinitely.\n\nIn addition, the police department\u2019s most vocal, visible critic -- a 27-year-old self-styled preacher with a criminal history -- has been arrested multiple times in the last month on warrants that include unpaid traffic tickets and attempts to revoke his probation from a 2009 felony. On Friday, Dominique Alexander was ordered to prison.\n\n\u201cWhy all of a sudden are we the target?\u201d asked Damon Crenshaw, vice president of the Next Generation Action Network, which organized the July 7 protest. \u201cWe\u2019re not protesting because we\u2019re mad at them. We\u2019re protesting because the problems still exist and they won\u2019t talk to us.\u201d\n\nCrenshaw said Alexander was targeted because of his protest activities and that the shooter, Micah Johnson, was not affiliated with their group.\n\nDallas has a history of cracking down on protesters.\n\nDuring the Occupy Dallas demonstrations in 2011, the city tried to require protesters to have a $1 million insurance policy, strengthened rules against camping in the city and eventually evicted campers from City Hall in a midnight police raid.\n\nIn 2013, the city cited a decades-old rule prohibiting holding signs within 75 feet of major roadways to stop a group that planned to protest the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. The city settled a lawsuit from that group before changing the law to prohibit protests on overpasses and other areas near highways. Another group sued over that law leading to another settlement, and the city repealed the rules all together.\n\nAlexander, the founder of the protest network, believes he was targeted because he refused to stop the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThey try to hush and silence people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a failure to the lives lost if we don\u2019t continue. The issues still exist, and they can act like they want to heal, but then they ignore the issues.\u201d\n\nThe police chief has support from City Hall. Mayor Mike Rawlings said in a statement that he trusts Brown\u2019s \u201cjudgment in how he communicates with protest organizers.\u201d\n\nAlexander, whose record includes convictions for forging a check, evading police and theft, was on probation for a 2009 conviction for causing injury to a child. He said the 2-year-old he was watching had fallen off the couch, but hospital staff said the child\u2019s injuries were more consistent with abuse.\n\nAlexander denied injuring the child and said he pleaded guilty because he could not afford a good attorney.\n\nHis uncle was killed by police in 2010 after firing on officers. But it was the 2014 death of a woman he knew in high school that prompted his involvement in police protests, Alexander said. The woman was missing for a week before being found dead in an abandoned building. Her family complained that police ignored their initial pleas for help.\n\nAlexander spent the past two weeks under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor and awaiting a judge\u2019s determination of whether his probation would be revoked.\n\n\u201cNo new crime has been committed to warrant this kind of action,\u201d said Kim Cole, one of Alexander\u2019s attorneys. \u201cAnd the timing does appear suspicious.\u201d\n\nJust days after a July 29 silent protest -- the first following the sniper attack -- authorities asked that Alexander\u2019s probation be revoked for a variety of violations, including twice leaving the state without notifying his probation officer, once to attend the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Court records show the judge admonished Alexander and added 30 hours of community service to his sentence.\n\nThen on Aug. 10, following a confrontational appearance at a city council meeting, Alexander was cited for trespassing and escorted out of City Hall, where officers were waiting to arrest him on nine outstanding traffic ticket warrants. He spent the night in jail and, within an hour of his release, another arrest warrant was issued in a new attempt to revoke probation. That request rehashed clprevious allegations from the past year, including missed meetings with his probation officer, for which Alexander had already served 10 days in jail in December.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s hearing, the judge considered all of Alexander\u2019s probation violations and sent him to prison for two years. With credit for time served, that comes to about six months, his attorneys said.\n\nProsecutor Douglas Millican denied that politics were behind the efforts to revoke Alexander\u2019s probation. But Cole said Alexander got extra scrutiny because of his protest activities, noting that police and sheriff\u2019s officers had provided the judge with social media posts and other photos and video of Alexander to show he had left the state.\n\nIn addition to the protest crackdowns, city and police officials have also succeeded in suppressing questions about the shooting, including details about the law enforcement response and the motive of the gunman, who was killed when police deployed a bomb-carrying robot. It was the first time law enforcement in the U.S. had used a robot to deliver and detonate an explosive to kill a suspect.\n\nAuthorities have refused public records requests for police reports, 911 calls, audio and video recordings, autopsy documents, crime scene photos and evidence gathered at Johnson\u2019s house, which police initially said held an arsenal of weapons and bomb-making material and a journal of combat tactics possibly indicating plans for a larger attack. Other officials have told The Associated Press that Johnson did not have a large stockpile of bomb-making materials.\n\nThe Associated Press was informed by Dallas police late Friday that a portion of the records it requested would be made available, but the content was unclear.\n\nBrown told the City Council earlier this month that much of the information about the attack could be withheld for an indefinite period during an investigation into whether the use of force was justified. He declined to estimate how long that investigation might take, but said his office\u2019s findings would be reviewed by the district attorney and a grand jury.\n\nThe police chief did acquiesce to one of the protest network\u2019s top demands, agreeing to eliminate a 2013 policy allowing officers 72 hours to give a statement after being involved in a shooting. The move, announced in a nighttime post to the department\u2019s blog, said officers \u201cwill be provided the same legal rights as any other citizen who is the subject of a criminal investigation.\u201d",

        "text": "For a presidential candidate who has only won a single primary so far and has the fewest delegates of any of the three surviving candidates in the Republican presidential nomination contest, John Kasich has certainly been receiving his share of the attention. The Republican Party establishment, or at least elements of the establishment, has imprinted him as the \u201clast, best hope\u201d for mainstream Republicans to stop the Donald Trump train. But in light of Trump\u2019s crushing victory in New York last night, winning more than 60% of the vote, the prospects of a contested convention in which Kasich might emerge as the nominee has grown notably more dim.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s disastrous performance (he won just 14.5% of the vote) does little to help the cause of those Republicans who see in Cruz an instrument of Trump\u2019s downfall. And, while Kasich got 25% of the vote, this is hardly solace to those who have been vying for Kasich to emerge as the savior of the Republican Party.\n\nIndeed, in virtually any other presidential election cycle, a candidate who had piled up the kind of victories Trump has managed to achieve would be considered the presumptive nominee, and any remaining opposition would be under extraordinary pressure from the party establishment to throw in the towel and support the frontrunner. Of course, the phrase \u201cnormal political year\u201d doesn\u2019t quite describe 2016, and Trump is hardly the garden-variety frontrunner. There was a brief flurry of speculation about House Speaker Paul Ryan, who seemed to be on the verge of jumping into the race before he pulled the plug on a late entry into the nomination sweepstakes. But even Republicans still unable to even contemplate the prospect of a Trump nomination have surely come to the conclusion that trying to manipulate the process in a way that hands someone the nomination who hasn\u2019t even competed in the primaries would be a complete nonstarter, and even if such an effort got off the ground, would run the very real risk of blowing up the party.\n\nFor Cruz, the interest in Kasich is probably a sure sign that the Republican establishment will do everything within its power to prevent him, a candidate held in perhaps only marginally more regard than Trump (due to his perceived grandstanding in the Senate and refusal to \u201cplay ball\u201d with the GOP leadership), from getting the nomination. Were Cruz to prove the eventual agent of Trump\u2019s downfall, that would likely not endear him to most establishmentarians, for whom, as has been frequently noted, his usefulness to the \u201cStop Trump\u201d movement would come to an abrupt end. Cruz has been a placeholder, serving a useful purpose, but with no thaw in the party establishment\u2019s view of him.\n\nEven if he did win New York, the Kasich option seems farfetched. Where would he get 1,237 delegates, the minimum necessary, to win? Would a sufficient number of Trump or Cruz delegates peel off on a second, third, or even fourth ballot to give Kasich the nod? What seems far more likely is that at some point, if it seems clear that the establishment types have a realistic chance of pulling off a coup and installing Kasich as the nominee, delegates representing the Trump and Cruz factions would seek to take matters into their own hands, and, in some kind of \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d agree, holding their collective noses as they did so, to support one or the other of the candidates in return for significant concessions, either in terms of the vice presidency (if not Cruz himself than someone else acceptable to Cruz delegates), or in return for a significant voice in shaping the party platform and rules.\n\nAfter all, Cruz is a young man\u2014only 45 years old\u2014and he may well be beginning to think about his options in a world in which he is not the 2016 nominee. To do something that risks crippling the Republican Party for years to come would surely not be in his interests. Even the vice presidency is not completely out of the question as part of a grand bargain. While it is obvious there is no love lost between Trump and Cruz (an understatement if ever there was one), Cruz in the second position on the ticket is not completely implausible. Politics does indeed make for strange bedfellows, as John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would attest in the Democratic nomination battle of 1960. LBJ was loathed by the Kennedys and their supporters, who saw LBJ as a lightweight, cornpone Texas hack (completely dismissing LBJ\u2019s incredible legislative skills), and who wanted a liberal like Hubert Humphrey or Stuart Symington as his running mate. While Johnson\u2019s selection made complete sense from the standpoint of the general election, a Trump-Cruz ticket would likely not offer the kind of boost that Trump might be looking for.\n\nOf course, all of the above may very well be a theoretical exercise. Over the past week or so, Trump has appeared to strike a responsive chord with his recent comments, including an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, that the nominating system is rigged against him. But what may especially resonate was his ability to link what he perceives as the unfairness of the nominating system with the general sense felt by many Americans that the Washington establishment is rigged against them. Whatever Trump\u2019s limitations and weaknesses as a candidate, he and his campaign seem to have an uncanny ability to identify messages that resonate with voters, and the \u201crigged\u201d nomination process message might be the one that puts him over the top in Cleveland with a first ballot victory.\n\nThe next few weeks will not be kind to either Cruz or Kasich. Trump is almost certain to sweep the primaries in the northeast and Middle Atlantic states on Tuesday, including the big prize of Pennsylvania (Cruz may be able to win Indiana and West Virginia a few weeks later), and is now positioned to have enough delegates following California on June 7 that he will be within striking distance of the nomination. At that point, the dreams of the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement will turn into a nightmare. Either Trump will then use the period between June 7 and the start of the Republican Convention on July 18 to pick off the handful of remaining delegates needed, or, in a reprise of Gerald Ford\u2019s successful nomination in 1976, obtain the remaining delegates during the convention itself. The Trump card, of course, is the vice presidential spot on the ticket. Given Trump\u2019s problems with female voters (including governors Susanna Martinez of New Mexico and Nikki Haley of South Carolina), the obvious pick is none other than Kasich, governor of a critical battleground state and a candidate with extensive Washington experience, which Trump has claimed to seek. And, it is worth pointing out that Trump and Kasich have made nice with each other from the beginning. This may be no accident, as the Marxists say. So, Kasich may well have his day in the sun, just not quite in the role envisioned by the beleaguered party bigwigs.\n\nDr. Euel Elliott is a professor of public policy and political economy and the associate dean in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Grenada had been troubling the Reagan administration ever since its Constitution was suspended after a coup in 1979, and the new government began to cozy up to Communist Cuba.\n\nThe American invasion of Grenada was very unpopular in Britain, as Grenada was a Commonwealth nation.\n\n\u201cIf I were there Margaret, I\u2019d throw my hat in the door before I came in,\u201d Reagan said, which the BBC recalled was an old tradition that allowed an unwelcome guest to announce their arrival before they entered a room. The full transcript of the phone conversation is available on the Margaret Thatcher Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nWhile Thatcher wasn\u2019t exactly forgiving, she did say she understood where Reagan was coming from. \u201cI know about sensitivity, because of the Falklands. That\u2019s why I would not speak for very long even on the secret telephone to you. Because even that can be broken. I\u2019m very much aware of sensitivities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe action is underway now and we just hope it will be successful.\u201d\n\nThe conversation ended on good terms, though, with Thatcher getting off the phone to go to a \u201ctricky\u201d Parliament debate, and Reagan encouraging her to \u201cGo get \u2019em. Eat \u2019em alive.\u201d\n\nThe tapes, released to the public in October at the Reagan Library in Los Angeles, prove that Reagan continued the long Presidential tradition of recording phone conversations in the White House situation room, even after the debacle with former President Richard Nixon years earlier.

So Jin and his team went back to the drawing board, trying different technologies that eventually increased the tool\u2019s speed and accuracy. \u201cWe\u2019re over 90% now,\u201d says Jin. \u201c[And] customers like it.\u201d\n\nAt some companies, DeepFont\u2019s initial failure would have relegated it to the dumpster and damaged Jin\u2019s career. Adobe adbe , however, takes a different approach. \u201cIt\u2019s actually ideal when someone\u2019s first attempt at a new product or feature is a failure,\u201d says Mark Randall, the company\u2019s vice president of innovation. \u201cIt teaches people how to respond to what customers need or want\u2014which is often not what you\u2019d expect they want.\u201d\n\nRandall began building what he calls \u201ca whole culture of experimenting\u201d in 2013, when he started giving employees something he invented called Kickbox. An innovation toolkit that walks users through a six-step process of turning an idea into a marketable product, Kickbox is available to anyone who wants to download it, and Randall says hundreds of companies, government agencies, and nonprofits have done so. \u201cIt\u2019s completely free and open-source,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe don\u2019t even ask for your email address.\u201d\n\nOnly about 10% of Adobe\u2019s 14,000 own employees worldwide have used Kickbox and attended workshops on it. \u201cBut 10% is a kind of magical number, because once you get there, everyone in the company knows someone who is trying to innovate,\u201d says Randall. \u201cEven people whose jobs don\u2019t require innovation are exposed to it in some way. It creates a powerful shift in the culture.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, says Jin, who has been at Adobe for 12 years, getting approval for a new product is much faster now. \u201cBefore, you had to get buy-in from your own boss, the product team, and other departments,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, people work on projects without anyone\u2019s approval.\u201d Jin adds that, before Kickbox, \u201crisk taking was allowed. Now, it\u2019s rewarded. That has really changed the way people think.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason why, Randall observes, Adobe\u2019s approach is tough for most companies to embrace. He spends a lot of time talking to managers from elsewhere who want to encourage new ideas, but, he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really work to ask employees to take a risk on something new if the company isn\u2019t risking something, too.\u201d Noting that each Kickbox kit at Adobe contains $1,000 of the company\u2019s money\u2014not to mention the cost of the time employees spend working on projects that may or may not pan out\u2014Randall points out, \u201cWe fund each new idea before we know what it is.\u201d\n\nOther employers struggle with that, he says, and the bigger the organization, the more difficult it is, because trusting people subverts all the control mechanisms. \u201cMany people from big companies have asked me, \u2018Isn\u2019t there some way to let people [use Kickbox] without any risk to the company?\u2019\u201d Randall says. \u201cThe answer is \u2018no\u2019\u2014and in fact, ideally, you want to highlight that element of risk. Make sure everyone knows about it. Let employees know that you\u2019re betting on them to come up with great ideas.\u201d\n\nSo far, that bet seems to be paying off. Thanks partly to a crop of employee inventions that have proven popular with customers, Adobe reported record revenues of $1.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, up 25% from the same period in 2015, and a 48% jump in profits.",

        "text": "Closing Time By Joe Queenan Viking, 338 pages, $26.95\n\nThere is that desolate moment when the pub closes, announced by \"last call\" or the ringing of a bell: The final drink is taken and the cold gray world outside asserts itself again. A grim idea of closing time haunts Joe Queenan's memoir, and not only metaphorically. At 59, Mr. Queenan's life story is far from over, but he seems to feel compelled to look back in anger, as if to close off, for good, a desolate past that keeps reasserting itself and, one can easily imagine, poisoning his present happiness.\n\nThus we are told how Joe and his three sisters grew up in South Philadelphia public housing, the children of hapless Irish Catholic parents: an abusive, frequently unemployed, alcoholic father who was a ninth-grade drop-out and prone to beating his children; and an aloof, \"emotionally inert\" mother who \"sadly looked the other way.\" An altar boy, an early reader of books, Mr. Queenan lists by bitter rote his family's setbacks -- losing a house, heading off to the projects in disgrace. He feared himself doomed to a bad fate.\n\n\"Closing Time\" is in part the story of Mr. Queenan's claim to have won out over such misery and to have arrived at success in writing and a family of his own. But readers of previous Queenan books -- such as \"Balsamic Dreams\" or \"If You're Talking to Me, Your Career Must Be in Trouble\" -- will look here in vain for his trademark humor. Mr. Queenan confesses that, in his college years, his dream \"was to make a living by ridiculing people.\" In a way, he has managed to do just that over the years -- in books, magazine articles and reviews (including many for this newspaper). But his usual quipping self -- so amusingly cruel about the tackier aspects of American culture -- is absent in \"Closing Time.\" The book is an acrid portrait of Mr. Queenan as a man short on forgiveness.\n\nThere is no end to his \"war stories\" of squalor and deprivation. The father urinates in the sink. The family is forced to go on welfare and needs monthly vouchers for allotments of flour, sugar and canned egg yolks. \"One of my earliest memories of the project was being dispatched into streets to gather up cigarette butts for my father.\" The children eat off-brand cornflakes and gnaw on raw spaghetti while \"waiting for my father to come home with his paycheck.\" There is never peace at home. The father, a roaring drunk, always has his strap. \"He beat us often, and he beat us savagely.\"\n\nThe young Mr. Queenan badly thinks in categories, looking warily on the \"snooty neighborhoods\" and casting aspersions on just about everybody: the blacks of North Philly (\"Negro fugitives from the Dixie diaspora\"), the Italians (a \"reputedly shifty ethnic group\"). He confesses his \"contempt for diocesan priests.\" The tone is blue-collar hard, with its prejudices and poltrooneries.\n\nAs for Mr. Queenan's pathways out of the neighborhood as a young man, he describes a brief stay in a Maryknoll seminary, a host of dead-end jobs, a growing interest in literature and classical music, and a series of father surrogates, including semi-benevolent uncles who help him to rise out of the slums. The rise itself, in Mr. Queenan's morbid retelling, is neither thrillingly triumphant nor charmingly self-deprecating. It is instead, too often, suffused with preening -- how amazing the climb has been! And a baleful anger keeps intruding on the story, in spite of the persona that Mr. Queenan insists on giving himself -- that of a music lover, Francophile and man of sensibilities.\n\n\"My father's arsenal consisted of alcohol, brutality, and contempt; I fought back with Apollinaire, Brahms, and condescension,\" Mr. Queenan writes. He can divorce nothing from the father-fight. \"I learned to play basketball,\" he writes, \"partly because my father hated it.\" An injustice-collector, Mr. Queenan remembers every time his father wrong-footed him, from scratching his LPs to almost driving him to suicide (he swallowed some pills at the age of 20). Most of the time his relations with his father -- who died in 1997 at the age of 77 -- take the shape of a grim competition; and \"Closing Time\" is too obviously history written by the winner. When his dying father reaches out, Mr. Queenan rebuffs him: \"I didn't want him hugging me. The nerve-endings he was trying to reach had been dead for thirty-five years. . . . He had done bad things to God's children, and now God was doing bad things to him.\" Mr. Queenan has no trouble whatsoever in seeing himself, but not his father, as one of God's children.\n\nThe literary theme of father-son antagonism can be a great one. One thinks of Edmund Gosse's \"Father and Son\" (1907), in which a man of letters and aesthete looks back on a childhood dominated by a man who was both a remarkable amateur scientist and a dour, overbearing, Plymouth Brethren fundamentalist. \"The comedy was superficial,\" Gosse later wrote of his book, \"and the tragedy essential.\" There is J.R. Ackerley's \"My Father and Myself\" (1968), which is more than anything a search for an elusive (though domineering) father whom his son never really came to know. Except for a rather maudlin coda, \"Closing Time\" has not the grace, understanding and forgiveness of Gosse or the wistful charity of Ackerley. The book is almost suffocating, so obsessively is it dominated by loathing and a clash of temperaments.\n\n\"Which of us does not wish to kill his father?\" asks Ivan Karamazov in \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" Mr. Queenan more than once expressly does wish his father dead. He writes of himself and his siblings: \"We talked about him as if he were already dead; such wishful thinking was rooted in the hope that he would kick the bucket before reaching the age when he might expect one of us to take him in, because even though none of us was ever going to open our doors to him, one of us would have to draw the short straw and tell him that.\"\n\nAt the end of the book, with his father gone, Mr. Queenan adds almost parenthetically: \"We never said good-bye. I do not remember the last words we exchanged.\" He also writes: \"Clemency was not included in my limited roster of emotions.\" It is a shameful confession to make in any book.\n\nHard feelings appear to have affected Mr. Queenan's prose, normally popular but here windy and even awkward. \"But then again, he had always been susceptible to periodic bouts of brain fever, during which he attempted to rearrogate to himself that vast array of paternal rights he had long since abdicated.\" Or: \"Be that as it may, my spiel manifested an edifying, if jejune, savoir faire.\"\n\nIn the end, it is hard not to conclude that \"Closing Time\" was a book that Mr. Queenan felt he had to write -- for his own demon-chasing purposes. Its urgency will be less apparent to the rest of us.\n\nMr. Theroux's latest novel is \"Laura Warholic: Or, The Sexual Intellectual\" (Fantagraphics).",

But he has found his voice again since learning that Bernie Sanders is interested in his plight.\n\n\u201cI am a big-time Sanders fan and I hope he can help us,\u201d said the 37-year-old assembly specialist. \u201cBut even if he can\u2019t, maybe we can stop this happening to other American workers.\u201d\n\nThe Feb. 9 announcement by United Technologies Corp\u2019s Carrier unit that it would shift production to Mexico from Indianapolis has thrust the long-term trend of U.S. manufacturing job decline to the foreground of the nation\u2019s election year agenda.\n\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump seized on the announcement to amplify his position that companies such as Carrier should be taxed if they send jobs to low wage countries.\n\nDemocratic candidate Sanders called Carrier, a maker of air conditioners, an \u201cexample of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers.\u201d The 2016 U.S. presidential election is in November.\n\nCommunities around Indianapolis have witnessed a steady outflow of factory jobs over the past two decades. What made this action different was a YouTube video of the workers getting the news that by Thursday afternoon had more than 3.4 million views, and the political reaction to it.\n\n\u201cI came here 30 years ago looking for the American dream,\u201d said Hatice Lancaster, 51, originally from Turkey. \u201cMaybe I should have gone to Mexico instead.\u201d\n\nChuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents the Carrier workers, said he hopes to use the attention to force Carrier to reverse its decision.\n\nJones faces a steep climb. Carrier has told the union it can pay Mexican workers $3 an hour versus more than $20 on average in Indianapolis. A spokeswoman for Carrier said the company pays a \u201ccompetitive wage\u201d based on local conditions and could not discuss pay levels.\n\nSince 1998, the chain-smoking, plain-spoken and profane Jones has watched the number of factories represented by his local dwindle to 12 from 38. He and his staff can rattle off the names of plants that have closed.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.\u201d\n\nJones is now giving interviews to anyone who asks \u2013 he was interrupted by multiple phone calls seeking comment while talking to Reuters \u2013 in the hope \u201cthis time America will pay attention and do something about rampant corporate greed.\u201d\n\nJones is grateful that Trump has drawn public attention to Carrier, but he sees Sanders \u201cas a champion for our cause.\u201d Jones said he has been contacted by the Sanders campaign. A member of the Sanders campaign said the Vermont senator\u2019s team would be in touch with Jones.\n\nSome Carrier workers interviewed outside the plant said they are drawn to Trump.\n\nBrian Easton, 45, said he and his wife work for Carrier, and are now coming to terms with what he said is likely to be a permanent drop in their living standard.\n\n\u201cThis country is run by Corporate America and we need someone in office like Donald Trump who is not beholden to anyone,\u201d Easton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can save our jobs, but if we draw attention to this perhaps other workers won\u2019t have to go through this.\u201d",

        "text": "Ever since the European Union\u2019s top court ruled in May that individuals have a \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d Google has been working to abide by the new rules. The company has received over 70,000 takedown requests from individuals who want 250,000 webpages removed from Google\u2019s search results. Google\u2019s team individually reviews each application, and the company plans to hire more employees to handle the extra workload. Changing the way people think about the Internet is an overwhelming task.\n\nBut Google is not the only company scrambling in the wake of the E.U.\u2019s decision. As Internet users begin requesting that unsavory parts of their pasts or personal contact information be erased from Google\u2019s search results, so-called reputation management companies are seeing a flood of new business. Traditionally confined to creating new web content about their clients\u2014laudatory blog posts, celebratory articles, swooning social media updates\u2014these companies are now trying to help their clients erase content as well. \u201cOnline image management has long been in the business of producing new content so you have a better persona online,\u201d says Cayce Myers, a professor at Virginia Tech and legal research editor for the Institute for Public Relations. \u201cHere they\u2019re doing the reverse.\u201d\n\nOnline reputation management is a growing business that is now being boosted by the E.U. ruling. For a fee that can amount to thousands of dollars a month, companies take on clients and scrub clean their search results by creating search engine-optimized content that hog up the first few pages of search results on Google. Clients ranging from CEOs, major corporations, celebrities down to doctors and restaurateurs who use the services to whitewash their online presence. Media consultant BIA/Kelsey forecasts that small and medium-size businesses will spend $3.5 billion managing their online reputations in 2014.\n\nNow, the E.U.\u2019s court ruling has changed the dynamics of the industry, expanding these businesses\u2019 client base and making it easier for them to delete content rather than just create it. \u201cThe number of our inbound leads\u201d\u2014new referrals\u2014\u201chas gone up about 50 percent since the beginning of May,\u201d says Simon Wadsworth, managing director of the U.K.-based online reputation management firm Igniyte. The E.U. ruling \u201chas raised awareness of the industry. You can change how you do things online.\u201d\n\nBertrand Girin, the founder of a France-based reputation management company, Reputation VIP, has created a spin-off service that specifically to designed to help people make \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests to Google. Aptly named Forget.Me, it lets users choose from one of 40 boilerplate requests in nine separate categories in order to send Google a pre-formulated request. The service, which is free, allows users to bypass some of the thorny legal questions and the difficulty of properly structuring a request. \u201cWhen Google put its form online, we looked at the demand from the public and we saw a gap,\u201d says Girin. \u201cWe said, \u2018let\u2019s help people understand what their problem is.\u2019\u201d\n\nForget.me has 17,000 registered users who have submitted over 2,500 applications to Google. The boilerplate response responses, which were written by lawyers, can be modified by users to address more specific claims. Girin is promoting the service as one that makes it easy for regular people to be forgotten on the internet. Dealing with Google is a \u201cbureaucratic hassle,\u201d says Myers, the legal research editor for the Institute for Public Relations.\u201dYou can technically do it yourself for free, but navigating the bureaucracy is in a state of flux.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see where it could be cumbersome,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe buzz around right to be forgotten has given these companies much-wanted attention. Andy Donaldson, the CEO of the reputation management company Hit Search, has invested heavily in building and marketing a search software that allowed users to monitor their own online personas over multiple platforms. But Donaldson said that since the E.U. ruling, the number of his company\u2019s new client leads has increased by \u201cupwards of three or four hundred.\u201d \u201cWe invested in post-graduate doctors in computer science and mathematics to help us build our algorithm,\u201d Donaldson said, \u201cBut it ends up being something like this that triggers the market that\u2019s really totally out of our control.\u201d\n\nDonaldson gave an example of how the E.U. ruling has been a boon for business. (He couldn\u2019t disclose the names of his clients.) The CEO of a large U.K.-based company was involved in a dispute during a friendly rugby match with a well-known journalist. The journalist wrote a damning story about the incident, blaming the CEO. The CEO\u2019s wife, having just read about the E.U. ruling, sought out Hit Search to get the story removed from Google\u2019s search results.

        "text": "Gordon Parks is one of America\u2019s most celebrated photographers. He is also one of the most misunderstood. Museums and galleries around the world have celebrated him as the creator of some of the 20th century\u2019s most iconic images. Yet to appreciate only his achievements as an artist is to underestimate his importance as a documentary photographer and journalist. The photo essays Parks produced, primarily for LIFE magazine from the 1940s to the 1970s, on issues relating to poverty and social justice, established him as one of the era\u2019s most significant interpreters of American society. His peers were writers like Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin as much as they were LIFE photographers like Margaret Bourke-White and W. Eugene Smith. Visual Justice: The Gordon Parks Photography Collection at Wichita State University, an exhibition at the Ulrich Museum of Art (for which I served as senior project advisor), examines photographs from six of his most powerful photo essays, enriching our understanding of his work in its historical context.\n\nIn interviews and in his memoirs, Parks, who passed away in 2006, always emphasized that there was \u201cno special black man\u2019s corner\u201d for him at LIFE. He was as comfortable photographing celebrities, Paris fashions and Benedictine monks as he was an impoverished family in Harlem and Black Panther Party members in Oakland. Photographs which are far removed from pressing social concerns make up part of Visual Justice. Yet, as its title suggests, the photo essays that grapple with social justice are at the heart of the exhibition.\n\n\u201cHarlem Gang Leader,\u201d from 1948, was Parks\u2019 second major assignment for LIFE. Parks spent a month with 17-year-old Red Jackson, the teenaged gang leader of the story\u2019s title, and other members of the Midtowners gang. His goal, he once said, was to show that juvenile delinquents were teenagers whose lives could be turned around if the right social service agencies intervened. As Russell Lord, a curator at the New Orleans Museum of Art, has shown, Parks discovered that when he turned in his film to LIFE\u2019s laboratories, he ceded control of his story to the magazine\u2019s editors. While the tone of the published photo essay was generally sympathetic to Jackson and the other gang members, it emphasized violence and slighted the potential for rehabilitation. Parks learned his lesson. His eagerness to write the text that accompanied his future photographs reflected his desire to assert more control over their message.\n\nParks was one of LIFE\u2019s best known and most admired photographers by the time that \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Day Is Almost Over,\u201d his photo essay about the Black Muslims, appeared in 1963. His star status allowed him to exert more control over his story than he had over previous stories. The result was a nuanced and finely textured photo essay that challenged conventional wisdom about the group. Visual Justice contains 30 of the photographs that Parks made, most never before published or exhibited, during the three months he worked on the assignment, traveling from New York to Los Angeles, with stops in Chicago and Phoenix. They portray a religious community that is far different from the dangerous collection of fanatics that television and the press usually depicted. They emphasize the importance of family, faith and disciplined, peaceful protest. Many of the images show Malcolm X, who was Parks\u2019 guide through the world of the Black Muslims, in a variety of roles\u2014spokesman, prayer leader, amateur photographer.\n\nIn 1968, Parks\u2019 editors challenged him to show them (and LIFE\u2019s readers) the roots of the anger and frustration that were then so evident in the African American community. In \u201cA Harlem Family,\u201d his subjects were the Fontenelles, a family whose lives were battered by menial jobs, poor schools and wretched living conditions. Their plight tortured Parks, who often found himself buying food for them. Darkness and despair pervade the photographs. Plaster peels from the walls of the family\u2019s apartment; children huddle under blankets for daytime warmth; the father stares blankly into a void.\n\nIn the pages of LIFE, \u201cA Harlem Family\u201d began not with a photograph, but with a prose-poem by Parks. Speaking in the voice of black America, he asked his readers, whom he understood to be white, to \u201cLook at me. Listen to me. Try to understand my struggle against your racism.\u201d Parks hoped to provoke a response, and he got it. Hundreds of letters, now preserved in the Gordon Parks Papers at Wichita State University, poured into the magazine\u2019s offices. Some were hostile, blaming the Fontenelles for their own misery. Many were sympathetic, however, expressing concern and asking how to help the family. Readers sent money. Their contributions were enough, in fact, that when LIFE topped them off, the Fontenelles were able to move out of Harlem and into a new apartment in Queens. But tragedy followed them. In the spring of 1969, LIFE reported that a fire had broken out in the family\u2019s new home and that the father, Norman, and a son, Kenneth, had died. In his memoirs, Parks described the overwhelming guilt he felt for their fate. He stayed in touch with them until the end of his life, offering them a hand whenever they needed it.\n\nParks was a man of many pursuits\u2014photographer, novelist, poet, memoirist, filmmaker, composer. But he is most remembered as a photographer. And while some of his images live on because they delight the eye with their beauty, others endure because of the way that they touched the hearts and minds of millions of LIFE\u2019s readers and changed, if only just a little, the course of American history.",

Both wireless carriers and Internet companies alike are making big bets that you will soon, generating more traffic and revenue in the process.\n\nBut most Web sites aren\u2019t ready to receive mobile visitors: Complex designs and intense graphics often turn conventional Web pages into gibberish on phones or other mobile devices.\n\nNow, an upstart group hopes to change that by promoting a new Web address and set of design standards it says will make the Internet more accessible for users with tiny, portable screens.\n\nIn May, Dublin-based Mobile Top Level Domain will start taking registrations for \u201c.mobi\u201d Internet addresses, joining the familiar .com, .net and international domains such as Japan\u2019s .jp and the European Union\u2019s .eu suffix. Registrants that want to use .mobi addresses will have to overhaul their sites to make sure they work as well on a cell-phone screen as PC. If they don\u2019t, their address\u2013and their business\u2013will be put on hold.\n\nLed by General Manager Neil Edwards, the group hopes to tap into a growing U.S. mobile data marketplace that reached $8.3 billion last year, according to the Yankee Group. Edwards, who spent six years as vice president at VeriSign\u2018s Network Solutions group, says the new domain\u2019s accessibility standards could help spark more mobile Web traffic.\n\n\u201cTaking the Internet as we know it with content built for a PC with broadband and a .com address just doesn\u2019t work for mobile phones,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople are going to trust .mobi because they know it works and it works fast and cost-effectively.\u201d\n\nMobile phones have tiny screens that make Web browsing difficult, but that\u2019s not their only limitation. The devices usually have cruder browsers than their PC counterparts and can have trouble with large graphics and embedded multimedia. Streamlined .mobi sites are supposed to make the Web pages easier and faster to load.\n\nWeb sites don\u2019t have to use a .mobi address to accommodate wireless users. Many of the Internet\u2019s most popular Web sites, such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com , already have slimmed-down versions for cell-phone browsers.\n\nIn many cases, users need to find the mobile edition manually, but some companies have also set up redirection commands that automatically send phone surfers to the lo-fi version. Still, actual mileage may vary: In an informal test, Time Warner\u2018s AOL.com seamlessly redirected a user with a two-year-old Sony Ericsson T610 on T-Mobile\u2019s network to its mobile site, but balked when approached by a higher-tech Dell Axim X30 mobile device. An AOL rep says that mobile users should head directly to mobile.aol.com to avoid any issues.\n\nEarly .mobi backers include Web content giants such as Google , which already has its google.mobi site up and running, and Microsoft , whose Windows Mobile operating system powers many of the newest smartphones and palmtops in the U.S. Other .mobi sponsors include device mobile manufacturers Nokia and Samsung and mobile carriers such as Deutsche Telekom\u2018s T-Mobile, Telecom Italia Mobile and Vodafone , which, along with Verizon Communications , owns Verizon Wireless in the U.S.\n\nWill .mobi catch on? Most Web users still associate Internet browsing with .com addresses, with good reason: According to VeriSign, almost half of the 85.6 million domain names registered worldwide in late 2005 were .com addresses.\n\n\u201cThere is a definite and strongly held perception out there that you have to have .com to do business online,\u201d says David Melancon, North America president of FutureBrand, a New York-based branding firm.\n\nBut Melancon says as it becomes harder to get elite .com addresses, that perception will have to change. While he isn\u2019t sold on .mobi, he says a company\u2019s Internet address will become a less important part of their brand in the future.\n\n\u201cWe got used to dialing ten phone digits instead of seven, and we will easily get used to this as well,\u201d he says. \u201cWith more and more addresses, \u2018something-dot-com\u2019 as a brand is going to start to lose power.\u201d\n\nComments are turned off for this post.",

The reality is that today Assad\u2019s people are still killing more Syrians than Isil \u2013 but it is a close thing. It is also clear from intelligence that the US air campaign against the terrorist group has been causing it to change.\n\nWhile Iraqi Ba\u2019athists remain in firm control and their officers command the majority of the military capability made up of lowly Sunni Arab tribal fighters, their degradation has meant foreign fighters \u2013 including British subjects \u2013 are rising to command appointments and influential posts. Those who have had contact with the group have identified the British Jihadists as militarily inept, yet by far the most bloodthirsty. These people are increasingly unpalatable to the vast majority of the Sunni tribes who populate Isil territory.\n\nAlthough the majority of the Isil fighters are Sunni Arab tribal fighters, they are increasingly reluctantly so. Trapped between the Assad Shia regime and the Shia-dominated Iraqi regime, they are effectively stateless. This is a direct result of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. This was a situation that was bound to cause strife. It has handed Isil a constituency. They have driven out the Christians, Yazidis and Druze as well as other minorities, all in order to strengthen their grip.\n\nNow we need a diplomatic effort in tandem with bombing to wrest that constituency back. The Sunni Arabs of the region need a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, something to hope for if they are ever to rise up against Isil. The minorities need to believe they won\u2019t be slaughtered if they return. The bottom line is that we need to give Syrian and Iraqi Sunni Arabs (as well as Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and others) a homeland free from the control of Iran and its proxies and rid of Isil \u2013 a safe place to return to. Hope for jobs, education and dignity. None of that is in Russia or Iran\u2019s plan. It must be the war aim of ours. We have to grab the initiative.\n\nThat means carving out a new Arab homeland that is free from external control. Such an entity must take account of the needs and wishes of Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia as well as the Russians, Iran and the Iranian proxies. This plan must be forced through for a just peace.\n\nBut will bombing help? There is no doubt we must degrade Isil\u2019s military capability and we must eliminate those who are targeting the UK directly. But I believe that we must tackle Isil as part of a wider campaign to solve the bigger crisis, and to aid our allies \u2013 the Free Syrians and the Kurds. We must address the crisis that is generating the refugee wave and which is at the heart of the regional instability.\n\nSadly, President Obama has displayed a complete lack of leadership in the region. It is clear he is a follower, so there needs to be a leader. I look to David Cameron to step up. We need our other allies in Saudi and Turkey and Jordan to focus and back us up in confronting Assad and defeating Isil. That means accepting and backing a plan for a Sunni homeland. We need to agree demarcation lines with Russia and her ally Iran. That all will need British leadership.\n\nBut the starting point is that MPs must vote to support a campaign to bomb Isil. Ignore Corbyn. Labour MPs will vote supportively in sufficient numbers. But we need to also work with our allies to help conceive and then create an entity to fill the vacuum that will be created when Isil collapses and when Assad and the Iraqi rump is safe behind Iranian lines.

The Texas law allows university presidents to enact their own rules regarding concealed handguns as long as those rules don\u2019t generally prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons on campus, and a 19-member task force at the University of Texas in Austin voted to recommend that concealed handguns be allowed in classrooms in December.

        "text": "Russian antitrust officials fined Google $6.8 million on Thursday, a relatively small penalty that nevertheless represents the latest in a growing list of global regulatory problems for the American search giant.\n\nRussian authorities ruled last year that Google had abused its market position with Android, its mobile operating system, by favoring some of its digital services over those of rivals, including the Russian company Yandex.\n\nAs part of its ruling, the Federation Antimonopoly Service said that Google\u2019s rivals had not been able to include their own offerings, like digital maps or search, in the Android operating system that powers a majority of smartphones and other mobile devices in Russia.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the agency said that Russia\u2019s competition rules applied to all companies operating in the country, including foreign ones.\n\nGoogle denies breaking Russian competition rules. The Silicon Valley company is still appealing the Android case in Russia, which was opened last year after Yandex complained that its services for Android were being treated unfairly.\n\n\u201cWe have received notice of the fine from F.A.S. and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps,\u201d Google said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nGoogle dominates its service areas in much of the world, but it has failed so far to do so in Russia, where Yandex retains more than 50 percent of the market for internet search, according to industry statistics.\n\nWhile the Russian fine is akin to a rounding error compared with Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue, the ruling against Android is the newest setback for the company at a time of mounting global competition investigations into the search giant\u2019s activities.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official, charged Google in April with unfairly using Android to promote its own services \u2014 like Google Maps and Google Search \u2014 over those of its rivals.\n\nEuropean Union officials have also charged the company in a separate competition case, accusing it of favoring some of its search services over those of rivals. They filed a third set of charges in July linked to Google search services offered to third-party websites, like newspapers and online retailers.\n\nGoogle denies wrongdoing in those cases, saying that it competes on equal terms with companies like Yelp and Microsoft, among others. It also says that cellphone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches.\n\nThe company\u2019s antitrust woes have also spread to the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering claims that Google\u2019s activities linked to Android are uncompetitive. American officials previously investigated whether the company had unfairly favored some of its services over those of rivals within its search engine, but they eventually decided not to bring charges.\n\nAnd in India, one of Google\u2019s fast-growing markets, the national antitrust authority sent the company a report last year outlining its concerns about search dominance and anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe Indian officials suggested that the company was abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people with knowledge of the report, which has not been made public.\n\nFollow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 12, 2016, on page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Fine in Russia Is Reminder of the Obstacles at Google.

        "text": "On Saturday, the Australian freestyler Mack Horton was in the warm-down pool before the competition when Sun, his main rival, vigorously splashed him, as if to get his attention.\n\nSun served a three-month suspension in 2014 for taking a banned stimulant.\n\n\u201cI ignored him,\u201d Horton, 20, said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have time or respect for drug cheats.\u201d\n\nThat night, Horton out-touched Sun for the gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle. Horton did not acknowledge him in the water and later called it \u201ca win for the good guys,\u201d although he and Sun did shake hands during the medal ceremony.\n\nMembers of the Chinese swimming team expressed outrage about Horton\u2019s actions, with the team manager Xu Qi calling for an apology. None has been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cMack obviously has very strong views about the need for clean sport, as every single one of us does,\u201d said the Australian delegation\u2019s chef de mission, Kitty Chiller. \u201cHe has every right to express his views and his displeasure in that sense.\u201d\n\nThe current Olympians Dana Vollmer and Cody Miller and past winners weighed in on the doping controversy at the Rio Games that has resulted in tiffs between Lilly King and Russian swimmers who were booed.\n\nSun went on to win the gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle Monday night.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t belong in a sport,\u201d Camille Lacourt, a star French swimmer, said Monday night in comments reported by the French newspaper L\u2019\u00c9quipe. \u201cThey should make up their federation of dopers and have fun among themselves. It disgusts me to see people who\u2019ve cheated standing on podiums. Sun Yang, in the 200 free, he pees purple.\u201d\n\nThat night, the American swimmer Lilly King, 19, cited Horton as an influence when she spoke out about Efimova.\n\nKing entered the Rio Games with the top time in the world this year in the women\u2019s 100-meter breaststroke. The next-fastest swimmer in the lead-up to the competition was Efimova, a 24-year-old Russian whose place at these Olympics was not confirmed until Saturday.\n\nEfimova, the reigning world champion, had served a 16-month doping suspension handed down by swimming\u2019s global governing body, known as FINA, a ban that ended in early 2015. Early this year, Efimova failed a test for the newly banned drug meldonium, but the result was overturned when she appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, arguing that she had already served her penalty.\n\nEvery time Efimova has raced inside the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, she has been booed. King demonstrated her disapproval in another way. After posting the fastest time in qualifying on Sunday afternoon, King wagged her finger to remind everyone who was No. 1.\n\nAs King looked on from the ready room, where swimmers gather before they race, Efimova won the first semifinal and mimicked King\u2019s move. King went out and won the second semifinal and shook her finger again.\n\nA spokesman for the International Olympic Committee said that fans want \u201cfair play\u201d from athletes amid tensions over doping and that the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, wants a life ban for serious doping.\n\nIn a postrace interview with NBC, King said, \u201cYou wave your finger No. 1, and you\u2019ve been caught drug cheating?\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan.\u201d\n\nIn a group interview in the mixed zone, King defended her actions. \u201cI\u2019m not this sweet little girl,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\nAll the finger wagging set the stage for the final on Monday night, when their score was settled in the pool. King occupied Lane 4. Efimova was in Lane 5. It was a duel at 100 meters. King turned first at the 50 and hung on to win with a time of 1 minute 4.93 seconds. It was her best time and an Olympic record. Efimova was second in 1:05.50, 19-hundredths of a second ahead of King\u2019s American teammate Katie Meili.\n\nAfter the race, King hung on the lane line that separated her from Efimova and splashed twice in Efimova\u2019s lane. King said she had not done it on purpose. But she also studiously avoided contact with Efimova.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she really wants to be congratulated by me,\u201d King said.\n\nThe news conference featuring the medal winners felt more like a trial than a triumphant review. King sat at the opposite end of the table from Efimova. Meili was in the middle seat, normally reserved for the gold medalist. Neither King nor Meili looked at Efimova, who was on the verge of tears from the opening question about the boos directed at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy I\u2019m here and racing,\u201d said Efimova, who looked miserable. She appealed to people \u201cto try to understand me,\u201d but King, who sat stone-faced through Efimova\u2019s answers, did not appear moved.\n\nSam Manchester will guide you through the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nHey. It\u2019s Sam from the NYT Sports desk. I\u2019m at the Olympics in Rio (so you don\u2019t have to be :)). Grab a limited spot and I\u2019ll text you updates, answer your questions and share the behind-the-scenes stuff nobody else gets.\n\nThanks! Talk to you soon.\n\nU.S. numbers only. Standard messaging rates may apply. Your information is used only to deliver messages about the Rio 2016 Olympics.\n\nAt one point, Efimova switched from English to Russian. The moderator nudged a pair of headphones toward King and told her she could use them to listen to the English translation. King declined, as did Meili.\n\nWhat is striking is that the antidoping chorus in Rio has consisted of newcomers and veterans alike, with Olympic rookies like Horton, of Australia, and King joining the 31-year-old Lacourt and Michael Phelps, who is also 31 and is the most decorated athlete in Olympic history.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the desire of Olympic athletes to uphold the values of the Olympic Games without exception,\u201d Adam Nelson, an American shot-putter and activist for athletes\u2019 rights, said in an email Monday.\n\nNelson was named the winner of the 2004 Olympic shot-put competition eight years after it was contested when the original champion, Yuriy Bilonog of Ukraine, retroactively tested positive for a banned substance.\n\n\u201cThese athletes know, when an athlete cheats, he or she will experience a residual physical benefit for many years,\u201d Nelson added. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a residual sentiment that negatively impacts the sport moving forward. The clouds of suspicion that linger over doped athletes who return to competition continue to take a toll on the value of the clean athlete.\u201d\n\nThere is not yet conclusive evidence on the long-term benefits to performance for athletes who took banned substances earlier in their careers. And as Thomas Bach, the I.O.C.\u2019s president, has repeatedly pointed out, lifetime bans from sports for doping offenses have not proved legally defensible. In the cases of men like Sun and Justin Gatlin, the once-barred American sprinter who has been another target of athletes\u2019 criticism since his return, they are being called out even though the system in place gives them every right to resume competing.\n\nKing said Monday night that she believed any athlete with a doping offense \u2014 including Gatlin \u2014 should not be allowed to compete. The national governing body for track and field, U.S.A. Track & Field, issued a statement on Tuesday rejecting that notion.\n\n\u201cThe WADA code indicates that when an individual has completed their suspension, they are eligible to re-engage in the sport,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Amateur Sports Act stipulates that if an athlete is eligible to compete, they cannot be prevented from being on a national team. So in the United States, it is a matter of law. If you are not under a ban, regardless of what you may have served in the past, you are fully eligible to be on the team.\u201d\n\nStill, Nelson defended the right of athletes to criticize once-barred competitors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not undermining the system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt highlights a major flaw in the system. Ms. King could have lost out on an Olympic gold medal future had the events turned out differently yesterday, and she would have had to accept the fact that a known doper beat her. Where\u2019s the spirit of Olympism in that outcome?\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 10, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Rio Pool, Disdain for Dopers Is Bubbling Over.

The estranged couple appeared at Brooklyn Supreme Court on Thursday morning, where a judge urged the pair to settle their dispute outside of court, according to the defendant's attorney, Harold Mayerson.\n\nA rep for Vereen tells PEOPLE that the actor originally filed for divorce from Andrea back in 1972 \u2013 and that she filed her own divorce paperwork two years later in 1974. According to the rep, Vereen believed the divorce had been finalized, and notes the confusion could be a result of bad record keeping or an oversight by Vereen's attorneys at the time.\n\nVereen's attorney, John P. DiMascio, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Thursday, he told\n\n, \"This is a personal matter, and nothing has been proven yet.\"\n\nMayerson, who is representing Andrea, tells PEOPLE that his client believed she had been divorced for decades, and only learned that the marriage was not legally dissolved recently when she went to collect Social Security.\n\n\"Mr. Vereen told her years ago they were divorced,\" Mayerson explains. \"But when she applied for Social Security, she found out that not only are they not divorced, but that some other woman is collecting under his name.\"\n\nThat woman, Nancy Bruner, married Vereen in Los Angeles in 1976. They ultimately divorced in 2012. However, according to Mayerson, Vereen would have had to mention the date of his divorce on his California marriage certificate. \"That's what's fishy about this,\" says Mayerson.\n\nThe attorney adds that after Andrea discovered she was still married, he contacted Vereen's team to work out a solution. \"We were negotiating with them, and they really didn't want to give much of anything,\" he explains. \"And then they, inexplicably in my opinion, filed this lawsuit [for divorce].\"\n\nWhile Mayerson does not believe that Vereen is \"a bad guy,\" he hopes that the singer/dancer \"will respect the fact that this woman raised his son and do the right thing.\" He adds, \"He left this young girl \u2013 she was 14 and pregnant at the time \u2013 to raise a child by herself in New York City, which was not easy at the time for an African-American woman, and life was tough.\"\n\nThe attorney says that Vereen has a union pension, has not collected Social Security yet and earned as much as $400,000 last year alone. \"It's not as though he's impoverished,\" Mayerson explains. Andrea, one the other hand, he says, \"has lived exceptionally modestly her whole life. She's a religious women, was a pastor, worked in churches, sang in choirs and was scraping everywhere along the way with virtually no help from him.\"\n\nWhile Andrea's lawyer is confident that the judge will rule in her favor, he is still hopeful the parties will reach a settlement outside of court. \"We're hopeful there will be a settlement before we go to trial and that Mr. Vereen will come to his good senses and get this settled and have a great twilight to his career.\"\n\nVereen, now 69, won best actor in a musical at the 1973 Tonys for his portrayal of\n\nand has also appeared in numerous films and television series.",

        "text": "Vin Scully was impressed with me as a broadcaster \u2026 at least that's what he told me.\n\nIt has been 23 years since I shared a booth with the Dodgers' legendary broadcaster, who's calling it a career this week after 67 years on the job. But when you were in the presence of greatness, you tend to remember all the details.\n\nOn May 19, 1993, I was part of a team that delivered the first Mandarin Chinese broadcast from a Major League Baseball game.\n\nWhen the Dodgers faced the Cincinnati Reds that day at Dodger Stadium, four radio booths were occupied to air the game -- in English, Spanish, Korean and Chinese.\n\nI was just out of college at the time, working at the Pasadena Star-News. When a press release announcing the game would be broadcast in Chinese made its way to our newsroom, I jumped at the chance. I lobbied the radio station to bring me on (pro bono, of course) to be part of the announcing team, selling my ability as a fluent speaker of both English and Chinese as well as my \"expertise\" in baseball.\n\nIt worked. Thomas Kao, the original announcer who was a local talk show host, graciously asked me to be his sidekick. I bounded into Dodger Stadium that afternoon with unbridled enthusiasm. It wasn't that I hadn't covered a Dodgers game before, but this occasion was much different. It was historic, and I knew I'd get to share a booth with the Hall of Fame voice of the Dodgers.\n\nAs the game went on, I took over more of the play-by-play duties as Kao did the scene-setting. S.C. Chao and Jerry Sung, famous baseball players from Taiwan, were also in the booth as our color analysts. For a first-time group that's never worked together before, I thought we had pretty decent chemistry.\n\nThen Scully walked in at the end of the third inning. The way the Dodgers radio broadcasts were set up at the time, Vin did the first and last three innings of the game, with him taking a break in the middle innings. He'd spend the fourth inning with us.\n\nI was thrilled and nervous at the same time. I remember telling myself: \"Do not stutter!\"\n\nBut Scully was as gregarious and gracious in person as his listeners have come to know during a career that began in Brooklyn in 1950. He sat down between Kao and me and immediately put us at ease. He asked us some questions (with me translating for our Chinese audience) and I did some in return. At one point, I asked him to call a few pitches and plays for our listeners, and he happily obliged.\n\nAs the inning went on, I had the occasion to describe a near double-play ball started by Reds shortstop Barry Larkin. When I finished, Vin was effusive in his praise, telling me my call was \"terrific,\" even though he didn't speak Mandarin and probably didn't understand what I said besides \"Larkin.\" But his reaction was so enthusiastic and genuine, if I had died at that moment it would've been a life well lived.\n\nThat call ended up on an NBC News feature and was part of the highlights package on that night's ESPN SportsCenter. We also were visited in the booth by then-Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley. The team was delighted with the broadcast and invited us back for a few more that season. I returned for five more games, doing the broadcasts solo, including the season finale in which the Dodgers denied the 103-win San Francisco Giants a postseason berth with a 12-1 victory.\n\nMy radio broadcast career ended after that season, though I had agreed to a deal to do both Dodgers and Lakers games in Mandarin Chinese in 1994, even appearing at a joint press conference attended by both franchises. The radio station I worked for folded a few months later, and I took a newspaper job in San Francisco and headed north.\n\nBut I'll always have the rare honor of having shared a booth with the great Vin Scully, with memories flooding back as he wraps up his incomparable career this weekend in San Francisco. I've probably heard thousands of his broadcasts in my life, but of course I'll treasure that one inning while he sat side-by-side with me above all others.\n\nAs Scully was departing the booth after that inning, he flashed his familiar toothy grin and said to me, \"Mr. Chi, it's been a pleasure!\"\n\nNo, Mr. Scully, the pleasure was all mine.\n\n-- Samuel Chi is the managing editor of RealClearSports.com and proprietor of College Football Exchange.

        "text": "When billionaire investor William Ackman organized a widely publicized conference call a year ago, he said it would prove that Herbalife Ltd. was operating a pyramid scheme in China in violation of local laws.\n\nThe March 2014 event was another jab in the long-running fight between the two sides, a saga that has seen wild turns in Herbalife\u2019s stock and left Wall Street scratching its head about who is right.\n\nOne year later, the debate about Herbalife\u2019s operations in China and Mr. Ackman\u2019s $1 billion bet against the company rages on. Now, federal prosecutors have begun to look at the presentation as part of their probe into potential market manipulation of Herbalife\u2019s stock, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nDocuments reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, and also separately provided to prosecutors, paint a complicated picture of Herbalife\u2019s business model in China. Hundreds of pages of research notes and transcripts of interviews with Herbalife distributors in China describe confusing and at times contradictory explanations of Herbalife\u2019s compensation model. This information, in part, underpinned Mr. Ackman\u2019s March presentation, along with information from Herbalife\u2019s federal securities\u2019 disclosures and internal documents.\n\nMr. Ackman said during the presentation that the work proved Herbalife is paying its distributors commissions on sales from downstream recruits, in violation of Chinese law, and that the system is deliberately vague in order to mask its true nature as a pyramid scheme.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price fell about 1.2% on the day of Mr. Ackman\u2019s presentation.\n\nThe company has denied all of Mr. Ackman\u2019s allegations. It says it is in full compliance with Chinese law and that regulators there haven\u2019t taken any action against the company. Herbalife says the compensation model is different from the one used in other countries, set to an hourly pay scale in order to comply with China\u2019s strict laws governing multilevel marketing companies. Distributors submit hour logs and invoices to document their work, the company says.\n\nAs previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office and New York field office of the FBI are investigating whether people, including some hired by Mr. Ackman, made false statements about Herbalife\u2019s business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price. Mr. Ackman\u2019s fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP has said it has acted lawfully and isn\u2019t aware of any false statements made by its contractors.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Herbalife for at least a year. That probe is continuing, as is a related investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that is focused on whether the company\u2019s business practices have violated any securities laws.\n\nHerbalife denies it is a pyramid scheme and says it is cooperating with the investigations.\n\nSpokesmen for the FBI, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, the SEC and the trade commission declined to comment.\n\nThe criminal investigation into potential market manipulation is pursuing multiple lines of inquiry. One area of focus, however, is the work of a consultant, Aaron Smith-Levin, who helped with the March presentation, people familiar with the matter said. He was commissioned by Mr. Ackman and his fund to scrutinize Herbalife\u2019s business in China.\n\nProsecutors have reviewed documents prepared by a researcher in China contracted by Mr. Smith-Levin that were later used during the two-hour webcast organized by Mr. Ackman last March, examining whether false information was spread about Herbalife in the presentation, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nNeither Mr. Ackman nor Pershing Square have been served with a subpoena or been visited by FBI agents in connection with the probe, another person familiar with the matter said. The investigation could end with no charges being filed.\n\nIn a statement, Pershing Square said that since the March presentation, it has received additional evidence from former distributors and a former Herbalife China employee that confirms that Herbalife is violating China\u2019s pyramid sales laws.\n\n\u201cHerbalife has yet to provide any evidence that our conclusion is incorrect. Rather, Herbalife has simply stated that our presentation \u2018reflects [a] continued failure to fundamentally understand Herbalife\u2019s business model.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlan Hoffman, a spokesman for Herbalife, said \u201cThe fraudulent China research is yet another example of the lengths to which Mr. Ackman will go in his campaign to manipulate Herbalife shares and enrich himself. We remain confident in the strong fundamentals of our business model and committed to helping people and communities improve their nutrition.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith-Levin said in an interview that it is \u201ctotally normal\u201d to receive contradictory information in the research process and that the notes prosecutors were reviewing didn\u2019t represent the full body of his work. He said he hadn\u2019t been contacted by prosecutors or FBI agents and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMr. Smith-Levin also provided to the Journal hundreds of pages of what he said were translated transcripts of his researcher\u2019s interviews with Herbalife distributors in China. The Wall Street Journal didn\u2019t review the original recordings of the interviews.\n\nAmong the translated transcripts was an Oct. 30, 2013, interview in Guangzhou with an Herbalife distributor identified only as Ms. Chen. During a more than hourlong chat at a coffee shop, the researcher, who had identified herself as a translator traveling to the city on business and not as a researcher, pressed Ms. Chen about Herbalife\u2019s hourly pay system.\n\nMs. Chen said that even when she didn\u2019t earn revenue on direct sales of Herbalife products, she could receive hourly pay from the company. She said she had a developed a \u201cmarket\u201d of 10 in three separate cities, without explaining what a market is.\n\n\u201cThat means [sic] your market\u2019s market will be counted as your market,\u201d the researcher asked. \u201cYes, sure,\u201d Ms. Chen answered, according to the transcripts.\n\n\u201cSo even if you do nothing, you will get paid.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith-Levin would later cite this dialogue as evidence that Ms. Chen was earning commissions on the sales of downline distributors she had recruited, a violation of Chinese law.\n\nBut later in the interview, Ms. Chen appeared to describe actual hourly work for which she was compensated, saying she\u2019d been paid for 11 hours of work the past month.\n\n\u201c[Eleven hours] is the time your staff market spend on building a market, like issuing a card, this is visible,\u201d Ms. Chen said. \u201cHours is not complicated, time spent on issuing a card, and time spend on building a market.\u201d\n\nIn a note inserted into the transcript the researcher wrote, \u201cThis is incorrect data. Ms. Chen doesn\u2019t know how her own hourly consulting fee is calculated.\u201d\n\nProsecutors\u2019 specific interest in the documents remains unclear. They are more generally pursuing potentially false information spread about the company, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMarket manipulation can be difficult to prove. Attempting to discredit a company, even through statements that turn out to be false, isn\u2019t necessarily illegal. Nor is it illegal if such statements were made by someone the person paid. Prosecutors would have to prove a defendant knowingly and willfully made false or deceptive statements, or caused them to be made, in order to manipulate a stock.\n\nWrite to Christopher M.

        "text": "A few weeks ago, a passenger in the cafe car of an Amtrak train near Wilmington, Del., overheard a juicy rumor. A Joe Biden ally was holding phone calls, promising people the vice president was preparing to enter the 2016 campaign. The eavesdropper alerted a reporter, who posted the tidbit online.\n\nIan Miller read the story and knew just what to do. Logging onto a political forecasting website called PredictIt, he quickly bet a few hundred dollars that Biden would enter the race. As Miller expected, the odds soared as the news spread. Then he hedged his bets, placing a wager that Biden wouldn\u2019t run. Soon he had notched a nice profit.\n\nSo it has gone all year for Miller. The 24-year-old high school teacher from the suburbs of Chicago has won online predictions on everything from President Obama\u2019s weekly approval rating (the key: look to historical benchmarks) to the prospects of a U.S. government shutdown to the results of the Israeli elections (he sensed Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party would siphon votes from the far-right). Since depositing $110 in March, Miller is up more than $16,000. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good couple of months,\u201d he says.\n\nWelcome to the new American campaign casino. For the first time in modern history, the average citizen 18 years or older can legally place real-money wagers on politics, in a marketplace approved by federal regulators. The new market for political betting, coupled with the explosion of the multi-billion dollar fantasy-sports industry that was roiled by scandal this week, has raised questions about the spread of online betting markets that have few rules to prevent forms of insider trading.\n\nLike Miller, many of the top speculators on PredictIt are political junkies who win money with a mix of savvy and speed. But PredictIt also allows for those with inside knowledge of future political events\u2014campaign pros, candidate aides or pollsters\u2014to profit as well. \u201cThe risk is that a bunch of people figure they\u2019re not one of the insiders, so they take their ball and go home,\u201d says investor Barry Ritholtz, a critic of prediction markets.\n\nThe danger of market manipulation came into sharp relief this week, as DraftKings and FanDuel, the billion-dollar behemoths of the daily fantasy sports market, were engulfed by reports of insider trading. A content manager for DraftKings placed second in a recent $5 million tournament on rival FanDuel, capturing a $350,000 jackpot that raised questions about possible exploitation of private information. Some employees at the firms have early access to valuable data on the composition of every single roster assembled by its users. An employee could exploit this information by selecting players\u2014for example, a star quarterback who is being under-utilized relative to his value\u2014that would give him the inside lane toward a victory. DraftKings rules barred employees from betting on their own site, but did not forbid betting on rival sites.\n\nBoth sports betting sites released a joint statement Tuesday to respond to the concerns. \u201cEmployees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams, and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, we continue to review our internal controls to ensure they are as strong as they can be.\u201d\n\nOperating on a much smaller scale, PredictIt doesn\u2019t guard against insider trading, though it does bar its employees from trading on the site. Take the betting market on the next majority leader of the House of Representatives. When influential Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan put out a Sept. 28 press release endorsing Georgia Rep. Tom Price for the post, Price\u2019s odds spiked from 15% to 83% in just hours. Anyone with advance knowledge of the press release could have made money. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing we can do,\u201d says Brandi Travis, a PredictIt executive.\n\nSince PredictIt launched in October 2014, its 37,000 members and counting have traded about $9.4 million in shares to date, lodging predictions on everything from whether Republicans will hold the Senate to whether the next U.N. Secretary-General will be a woman. Traders can bet up to $850 per contract, under rules issued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which authorized the project as an academic experiment run under the auspices of a university in New Zealand. (The fantasy sports sites are authorized through separate legislation.) PredictIt is run out of a Capitol Hill political technology firm called Aristotle, which takes a 10% cut of traders\u2019 profits. Aristotle has not disclosed how much it has made from running the program this year, but says it is a tiny percentage of the firm\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nThere have been no specific allegations of insider trading at PredictIt. Outside experts say that the $850 cap on each contract blunts the threat, because the relatively modest sums in play minimize the potential gains. At these stakes, traders are \u201creally doing it for fun and excitement,\u201d says economist David Rothschild of Microsoft Research, who was written extensively about the merits of prediction markets. \u201cThat cap will actually help PredictIt ward off\u201d such threats, Rothschild suggests. For those who study market theory, the input of traders with special knowledge is a feature, not a bug, because it should enhance the market\u2019s collective wisdom and thereby sharpen its accuracy.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the U.S. has experimented with campaign casinos. Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, Wall Street traders bet openly on election futures, with odds advertised in newspapers. In 1916, the equivalent of more than $165 million in today\u2019s dollars was wagered on the contest between Woodrow Wilson and Charles Hughes. But regulators eventually cracked down as abuses grew.\n\nIn recent years, U.S. users flocked to an Ireland-based platform called Intrade, a favorite of Wall Street investors that ultimately collapsed after it ran afoul of U.S. regulators. Intrade reported $230 million in bets on the 2012 campaign. The site underlined the promise and perspicacity of prediction markets; traders even forecasted events like the surprise capture of Saddam Hussein. But also showcased potential pitfalls. Late in the 2012 presidential election, a deep-pocketed trader began making huge bets that Mitt Romney would defeat Barack Obama, even as polls and most handicappers forecast that Obama would win re-election relatively easily. In all, the anonymous trader, who became known as the \u201cRomney Whale,\u201d poured an estimated $4 million into a bet that Romney would prevail. As a result, Intrade pegged the Republican\u2019s chances of prevailing much higher than the polls. The massive sum suggested to some observers that the Romney Whale was trying to manipulate a market that voters and many pundits came to regard as a better barometer than the polls.\n\nAfter watching Intrade\u2019s collapse, PredictIt went in a different direction, opting for a smaller scale and embracing constraints that would help its chances of winning approval from U.S. regulators. It is patterned after a tiny election market that has operated since 1993 out of the University of Iowa. The new site has become a touchstone for presidential campaign staffers, who consider its handicapping more accurate than early polling.

Designed to mimic the act of barefoot running, the minimalist running shoe has a shaped sole and a mesh top, with individual sleeves for each toe.\n\nIn its advertising, Vibram says the shoe improves posture and strengthens leg muscles. But the lawsuit says that using FiveFingers may be risky for runners.\n\n\u201cIndeed, running in FiveFingers may increase injury risk as compared to running in conventional running shoes, and even when compared to running barefoot,\u2019\u2019 according to a copy of the suit, filed in US District Court in Boston.\n\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox:\n\nThe Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Vibram suit follows several recent cases against Massachusetts shoe companies about how they market sneakers.\n\nLast year, Canton-based Reebok International Ltd. refunded $25 million to customers after the Federal Trade Commission found it made deceptive claims that its toning shoes improved muscle tone. A suit filed in January 2011 alleged that New Balance, of Boston, also overstated the benefits of its toning shoes.\n\nFiveFingers shoes have gained in popularity. Still, according to SportsOne Source, which tracks the sporting goods industry, barefoot-style footwear represents only 8 percent of the $6.5 billion running shoe market in the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally different manner of running,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Powell, an analyst with SportsOne Source, \u201cand you need to be pretty dedicated to it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThere are similarities between the Vibram lawsuit and the Reebok case, but the Vibram claims differ, he said.\n\nWhile Reebok promised firmer butts and toned legs as a result of wearing its toning shoes, he said the Vibram claims are more about the benefits of barefoot running, which Vibram claims are supported by scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cAnd there is ample evidence that training without shoes allows you to run faster and farther with fewer injuries,\u2019\u2019 the company says on its website.\n\nVibram, with corporate headquarters in Italy, is a 70-year-old company known for pioneering the use of rubber soles for footwear.

        "text": "THE riposte to doubts about Abenomics, the three-part plan of Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, to shake the country from its economic torpor, is more of the same, and a lot more. On October 31st the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stunned the financial markets by unexpectedly expanding its programme of quantitative easing. The bank\u2019s existing measures, a \u201cdifferent dimension\u201d of easing from past efforts, were already daringly bold. Now it will swell Japan\u2019s monetary base at an even faster pace, by around \u00a580 trillion ($712 billion) each year, up from \u00a560 trillion-70 trillion currently. To do so, it will hoover up still larger quantities of Japanese government bonds (JGBs). This additional step, said Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the BoJ, \u201cshows our unwavering determination to end deflation\u201d.\n\nThe bank\u2019s action is also an admission of partial failure thus far. Its bond-buying has succeeded in sparking some inflation, yet its goal of achieving price rises of 2% a year by around April 2015 remains a distant possibility. Along with the government, it badly underestimated the dampening effect of a hike in the consumption tax in April this year, which caused the economy to shrink by 1.7% in the second quarter. Because of faltering consumer and corporate demand, and falling oil prices, inflation is now heading in the wrong direction, and may dip beneath 1%.\n\nIn recent weeks, economists had started to question Mr Kuroda\u2019s oft-stated commitment to banishing Japan\u2019s entrenched deflationary psychology. They suggested that the bank\u2019s formerly conservative mindset might even be returning. Mr Kuroda\u2019s predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, pursued monetary easing only half-heartedly, and achieved little. Meanwhile, Mr Kuroda had sought to stealthily extend the deadline for exiting deflation. That did little to reassure that Abenomics was on track in spite of stalled growth and sluggish inflation. Upon announcing the additional easing, Mr Kuroda admitted that matters had reached a \u201ccritical point\u201d, as the bank\u2019s efforts were losing momentum.\n\nNow a fresh round of no-holds-barred QE will immediately boost Mr Abe\u2019s economic plan. The Nikkei stock index\u2014a vital gauge of success for the government\u2014rose to its highest level in seven years on the news. The yen lurched further downwards, which will help import inflation. In addition to the tidings from the central bank, there was still more sugar on offer for equity markets. The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest, said it would slash its holdings of government bonds from 60% to 35% in order to buy more shares. The strength of the co-ordination between the government, the BoJ and the ministry of labour, health and welfare, which oversees the GPIF, surprised observers. After the GPIF\u2019s changes, most economists had not expected further monetary easing until 2015.\n\nThe BoJ\u2019s action this week also took markets aback because in recent public appearances Mr Kuroda had stuck to a bullish economic outlook. Yet on October 31st the BoJ halved its forecast for economic growth for the 2014 fiscal year to 0.5%. The bank also made its timeframe for achieving 2% inflation open-ended, removing its two-year deadline. Nonetheless, following the additional easing, the central bank still expects to meet its inflation target in 2015. As well as buying an additional \u00a530 trillion of JGBs a year, the BoJ will also purchase more risky assets in the form of exchange-traded funds and investment trusts in Japanese property.\n\nA motivation for Mr Kuroda\u2014in addition to visibly slowing inflation and weak growth\u2014may have been an intensifying political debate over whether or not Mr Abe should again raise the unpopular consumption tax from 8% to 10% in 2015. The BoJ is strongly in favour of a second hike in order to repair Japan\u2019s stretched public finances. More monetary easing should encourage Mr Abe to press ahead.\n\nBut this latest round of QE is not without its detractors. In April 2013 the BoJ\u2019s nine-strong policy board voted unanimously in favour of its radical new monetary drive, this time it revealed a rare split. Four members voted against the expansion of monetary easing, which came just two days after America\u2019s Federal Reserve ended its third round of QE. It is unclear whether or not the dissenters disagreed with the extra stimulus itself, or merely with its timing. This week\u2019s further easing will intensify the worries around the policy announced last spring. Chief among these is that QE will be hard to exit without alarming the bond market. Yet for the time being, Mr Kuroda is waging a more dogged fight against deflation. The prospect of Japanese \u201ctapering\u201d is ever more distant.",

Bradley, the magazine's owner, on Tuesday and accepted it and resigned from The Times today. He said he expected to start at his new job in about two weeks.\n\nMr. Bennet's appointment was announced to the staff late this afternoon.\n\nA graduate of Yale, Mr. Bennet held an editing post at The Washington Monthly from 1989 to 1991 but otherwise has devoted his career to writing. He briefly resigned from The Times in 2003 for a job at The New Yorker but before starting decided he was not ready to leave the newspaper and continued at his post in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Atlantic has been searching for an editor since last April, when Mr. Bradley announced that he was moving it from its 149-year-old home in Boston to Washington. The magazine has been in some turmoil since, with many staff members in Boston deciding to stay there, and with Mr. Bradley hiring several writers on his own and rebuilding the operation in Washington, all without an editor at the top. In a sign of the flux, the current issue carries no masthead at all.\n\nMr. Bennet is the magazine's first official editor since Mr. Kelly stepped down in September 2002 to return to writing. Before Mr. Bradley had named a replacement, Mr. Kelly was killed in Iraq on assignment for the magazine. Cullen Murphy, the managing editor, oversaw The Atlantic without the title of editor; once the magazine's move to Washington was announced, he tapered off his duties. Scott Stossel became managing editor and handled the move, which is now virtually complete.\n\nMr. Bennet said he accepted the offer because \"it's a chance to help, encourage and preserve the practice of serious, long-form journalism and a chance to work with great writers and editors.\" He said that because of the \"uncertain time\" for print journalism, \"this kind of undertaking is more important than it's been.\"\n\nMr. Bradley said he selected Mr. Bennet, whom he first met through a mutual friend eight years ago, after a lengthy listening tour in which he talked to 80 leading journalists about his search for \"extreme talent\" and the mission for The Atlantic.\n\nHe said Mr. Bennet had \"lived life near the headlines,\" had excelled at long-form narratives, and had a \"selfless nature.\"\n\nBill Keller, executive editor of The Times, said he hated losing Mr. Bennet and called him \"an extraordinary talent \u0097 voraciously curious, an original thinker and a dazzling writer.\"\n\n\"He'll have to slow his heartbeat to the pace of a monthly, which may be frustrating for a guy so deeply engaged in the news, but it's a brilliant choice,\" Mr. Keller said. \"His name on the masthead will be enough to make me grab for the magazine.\"\n\nMr. Bennet was to become the paper's Beijing correspondent later this year and has been in language training since November.",

McLaren rightly informs us that last benchmark is some nine seconds quicker than the old McLaren F1.\n\nTo provide you with some perspective, the Porsche 918 Spyder is estimated to hit 62mph in under three seconds and 124mph in around eight seconds, while a Bugatti Veyron SS \u2013 the 1,183bhp orange merchant of speed \u2013 hits 124mph from rest in 7.3 seconds and 186mph in 15 seconds dead. So despite McLaren's claims that the P1 was never meant to be the fastest outright, it's clearly no slouch.\n\nProduction is limited to 375 models only, combining \u2013 as you know \u2013 a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 to an electric motor to provide 903bhp. And because it's a hybrid, emissions (combined) sit below 200g/km of CO2. There are also DRS and IPAS technologies on board to ally it closely with the company's Formula 1 activity. This is good.\n\nPirelli has been working with McLaren on the tires too, and has developed a special compound for the P1, probably something a little bit less rubbish than the F1 tire TopGear.com made in Turkey. Ahem.\n\nAnd here's one of the best bits about the P1. We're told the brakes are akin to those on a GT3 racer, developed by Akebono and featuring a new kind of carbon ceramic disc, previously used in space. Space!\n\nSadly, for us mere mortals, the price is equally cosmic. Because McLaren has confirmed that this limited run, 903bhp rear-wheel-drive hypercar that we estimate will weigh around 1,500kg (3,305lbs), will cost \u00a3866,000 ($1.3 million).\n\nThat's quite a chunk of change, but then the upcoming Porsche 918 Spyder and new Ferrari Enzo aren't going to be cheap.\n\nThis story originally appeared on TopGear.com.",

        "text": "So if they can help reduce injury, shouldn\u2019t they be mandatory, just like motorbike helmets? Australia tried it in the early 90s and the result was a 15 to 20 per cent drop in the number of hospital admissions for head injuries. That would have been great, but it also reduced the number of cyclists by around 35 per cent. The hassle and, for teenagers, embarrassment of wearing one steered people away from bikes and towards public transport and cars. And that, counter-intuitively, could have been bad news for their health.\n\nA recent study in the British Medical Journal showed that cycling has a positive health impact around 77 times larger than the potential for serious injury; essentially, there\u2019s a small chance that you\u2019ll come a cropper, but a very large chance that you\u2019ll reduce your likelihood of suffering mental illness, heart disease and obesity. That means the laws were hugely counterproductive; they reduced cycling injuries, but only by reducing the number of cyclists, and those people then became more likely to come to some other kind of less-dramatic and tangible harm. Clearly, if this was an acceptable approach then we could easily slash injuries by 100 per cent simply by banning bicycles.\n\nThe CTC, the UK\u2019s largest cycling charity, has long argued against mandatory helmet laws for a similar reason. It claims they would make cycling seem more dangerous than it actually is, putting people off. \u201cThe evidence on this question is complex and contradictory, providing as much support for those who are deeply sceptical of helmets as for those who swear by them,\u201d it says.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of enforcing new laws. In the first year after the Australian State of Victoria made helmets mandatory there were 19,229 Bicycle Offence Penalty Notices issued. Do we want to tie up that much police time on a crime which has no negative impact on a third party? South Africa made helmets mandatory, then couldn\u2019t agree on exactly how to enforce it, so never did.\n\nThere's even evidence that wearing a helmet can put you at more risk. A 2006 study by Jeff Brewster from the University of Bath found that drivers passed closer to cyclists wearing a helmet when overtaking than they did those without them. The driver's subconscious sees them as less vulnerable and therefore less worthy of a wide berth.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that mandatory safety devices such as motorbike helmets and seatbelts in cars have been lifesavers on a huge scale. But neither had the same potential for harmful side-effects: dissuade motorcyclists from riding and they\u2019ll buy a car, which is actually far safer (if less fun). Meanwhile, there is virtually nothing that will discourage drivers.\n\nPersonally, I believe that wearing a helmet has more pros than cons, even though cycling is not as risky as many would have you believe. But there are those out there who would rather not ride than be made to wear a helmet, and for that reason the idea is a non-starter.",

Now, thanks to the unlikely sex champion Bill Gates, graphene could be used to make the thinnest, lightest, most impenetrable condom ever conceived.\n\n\u201cThe common analogy is that wearing a condom is like taking a shower with a raincoat on,\u201d says Dr Papa Salif Sow, senior program officer on the HIV team at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has awarded $100,000 (\u00a360,000) to scientists at the University of Manchester's National Graphene Institute to aid their pursuit of the ultimate super-sheath. \u201cA redesigned condom that overcomes inconvenience, fumbling or perceived loss of pleasure would be a powerful weapon in the fight against poverty.\u201d\n\nAt only one atom thick, an all-graphene condom would put the Durex Ultra Thin to shame \u2013 although the fact that the material is barely visible to the naked eye could lead to some awkward moments between the sheets. A slight ruffle of the duvet and could it just float away?\n\nDr Aravind Vijayaraghavan, who will lead the research team, explains the focus is on developing a composite material, with latex, \u201ctailored to enhance the natural sensation during intercourse while using a condom, which should encourage and promote condom use.\u201d\n\nIt will be achieved, he says, \u201cby combining the strength of graphene with the elasticity of latex to produce a new material which can be thinner, stronger, more stretchy, safer and, perhaps most importantly, more pleasurable.\u201d\n\nBut Vijayaraghavan and his colleagues are not alone in their pursuit. The Gates Foundation has declared it will give out a total of $1m in grants to secure a next-generation condom that \u201csignificantly preserves or enhances pleasure\u201d \u2013 and there is no shortage of competitors.\n\nResearchers at the University of Oregon are using their grant to develop an ultra-thin polyurethane polymer condom with \u201cshape memory\u201d properties, that would vacuum-seal around the penis as it heated up during intercourse. The body heat generated during sex would make the condom\u2019s molecules retract, creating a snug fit twice as thin as the normal latex variety. If shrink-wrapping your manpiece isn't enough, it comes embedded with antimicrobial nanoparticles, to guard against sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nIf this all sounds too techy, then perhaps Mark McGlothlin, of Apex Medical Technologies in San Diego, has the answer. \u201cA lot of people are trying to get stronger and thinner material \u2013 that was always my focus,\u201d he told the New Republic. But why innovate, when the material already exists \u2013 in the form of collagen fibrils from cow tendons. After all, didn't people manage for centuries with sheep intestines? \u201cThe texture of collagen is very much like the mucous membrane,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feel of it, the heat transfer of it, and to the touch, it feels very much like skin.\u201d\n\nMcGlothlin plans to source his beef tendon from a Chinese food store in California, but he says that slaughterhouses, or even fish markets, are other potential sources. Next time you're at the butchers, you might think twice before turning your nose up at that bag of offal.",

        "text": "Walpole Old Chapel, Suffolk. Christopher Stell wrote despairingly to its trustees when they were planning to sell it. Photograph: Historic Chapels Trust\n\nChristopher Stell, who has died aged 84 from kidney failure, was recently described as the \"doyen of nonconformist architectural historians\". His reputation in this field was established by his weighty four-volume Inventory of Nonconformist Chapels and Meeting Houses in England that appeared between 1986 and 2002.\n\nThe architecture of religious dissent in England is sometimes modest and deliberately self-effacing, especially those places of worship built by the Quakers and the earlier Congregational and Unitarian groups. But from the 19th century nonconformity often produced well-appointed buildings, proud to assert differences from established religion in their architecture. All seek to bear testimony to centuries of religious diversity in England since nonconformist worship was first made conditionally lawful in 1689. Yet architectural (and other) historians have been slow to catch up and, until Stell's inventory, too often ignored the majority of places of worship in Britain \u2013 that is, those that are not Anglican.\n\nIn particular, Stell's work highlighted the many serious omissions in the Pevsner Architectural Guides of that time, with the inventory itself becoming a \"Pevsner for nonconformism\". Like his predecessor, Stell visited each site by car. Unlike Nikolaus Pevsner, he drove himself and also recorded the buildings with photographs, careful scale drawings and sometimes sketches. It was a marathon task and his family became used to his absence throughout the week.\n\nIt is a testimony to his work that the revised Buildings of England volumes of today do list and discuss nonconformist places of worship with far greater seriousness.\n\nStell was born and brought up in Liverpool, the son of a PE teacher, and read architecture at Liverpool University's School of Architecture. Completing his training, he resolved to be a building historian and early writing quickly established his credentials as an accomplished self-taught researcher.\n\nSo many chapels and meeting houses have been demolished since the second world war, especially in those working-class communities where the once thriving \"co-op and chapel culture\" has collapsed in recent decades. Their entry in his inventory has become their obituary. Many have been converted to other uses which at least preserves the chapel outlines in the English landscape; but the photos in the inventory poignantly show the lost interiors.\n\nIn 1988 Stell helped found the Chapels Society which has pioneered serious study of this neglected area. When he heard that Walpole Old Chapel in Suffolk was to be sold off he wrote to its trustees: \"It truly amazes me that any denomination should wish to dispose itself of one of the finest and oldest and most richly evocative buildings in its care. To dispose of a worn-out building is one thing. To disclaim any further interest in the one tangible link with early Suffolk Independency is another.\"\n\nIn fact the church did divest itself of this simple but moving building though happily it went to the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, of which Stell was also a founding spirit and trustee for two decades.\n\nStell was trustee of the Ancient Monuments Society for 30 years and attended every one of the annual Vernacular Architecture Group meeting for 50 years. He personally rescued a partly 17th-century stone house in Calderdale intended for demolition, which he bought for \u00a350. He got it listed and adapted it with the absolute minimum of modernisation, long before such a domestic style became fashionable.\n\nAlways modest but meticulous in his scholarship, he quietly appreciated the recognition of an OBE in 1989 and the fact that his work was the first port of call for younger scholars. A lifelong Baptist, he enjoyed the Athenaeum \u2013 traditionally better known for the Anglican bishops among its members \u2013 for Stell was a champion of religious dissent who felt confident in the corridors of power.\n\nMany will remember his astonishing recall for buildings he had last seen 20 or 30 years previously, his endless curiosity and his dapper hats. Sometimes he wore a brown bowler, sometimes a deerstalker \u2013 for he loved Conan Doyle stories, as only a meticulous detective of buildings would.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jean, whom he married in 1957, and their sons, John and Edward.\n\n\u2022 Christopher Stell, architectural historian, born 26 January 1929; died 16 January 2014",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 No regular event on my calendar is more richly entertaining than my monthly dinners with a beloved friend from prep school, Alan Marcus. The setting is invariably the Post House, a steak restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The stories are as predictable as the venue. Alan \u2014 whom I alone in the world call by his sometime teenage nickname \u201cBig Al\u201d \u2014 recounts riotous tales of our misadventures at the Hun School, a then scrappy, decidedly non-aristocratic, now elite and thriving, prep school in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nOne of his classics recalls how his buddy, a Saudi princeling bearing a strong resemblance to his grandfather King Faisal, went on a hunger strike to protest the banality of his courses. Big Al aided the sheikh\u2019s cause by smuggling cheeseburgers to his hospital room. That Al and I keep revisiting the same material hardly detracts from our amusement. We\u2019re constantly adding changes in rhythm, improvisational touches, and original grace notes to freshen the old stories. After all, did genius jazzman Coleman Hawkins play his masterpiece \u201cBody and Soul\u201d only once? Did Picasso paint each new muse on a single occasion?\n\nExalting those dinners is the parade of distinguished guests invited by Big Al, who runs a prominent public relations firm in New Jersey. The roster includes a mega-watt real estate magnate, the chief of a great New York hospital, and the former CEO of a major financial exchange. A couple of years ago, as a surprise, Big Al brought a trim, soft-spoken septuagenarian sporting a white Panama hat whom he introduced as Judge Herbert J. Stern. Though I hadn\u2019t heard of Judge Stern, it was soon evident that I should have. Big Al ran through Stern\u2019s amazing resume. Stern served 13 years as a federal judge, and is now arguably the top white-collar defense lawyer in America, representing ex-Cendant chief Henry Silverman in lawsuits over his disastrous merger with CUC (the cases continue).\n\nStern also serves as a counsel for Chevron CVX in one of the longest-running, most highly-publicized cases in the annals of the oil industry, appealing the nation of Ecuador\u2019s $18.2 billion judgment against Chevron for allegedly polluting villages on the Amazon in past decades. One larger-than-life client was Bernard Lafferty the late, heavily-tippling butler to heiress Doris Duke, who inherited millions from her estate.\n\nMORE: Chevron claims Patton Boggs tried to cover up a fraud\n\nEven Hollywood has come calling. In 1979, the State Department chose Stern as the only judge ever to try a post-War case in West Berlin. Stern presided over the trial of two East Germans who, using a fake handgun, hijacked a passenger aircraft and forced the pilot to land in West Berlin. The events were recounted in a 1988 feature film Judgment in Berlin, based on Stern\u2019s book by the same name. Martin Sheen played Stern, and Sean Penn, son of the director Leo Penn, co-starred. \u201cMartin is a totally straight-laced, plain-spoken guy who\u2019s been married to his wife Janet for 41 years, and loves taking her on location with him,\u201d declares the judge.\n\nThen, in September, Big Al sent me a pre-publication version of Stern\u2019s new book, Diary of a DA. It rushes headlong from his role in indicting the assassins of Malcolm X to ridding then shockingly-corrupt New Jersey of dozens of criminal politicians and mobsters to stopping a heroin ring run by the head of France\u2019s CIA to showing the US Attorney in Maryland how to catch pols on the take, resulting in the resignation of America\u2019s Vice President, Spiro Agnew. The book covers just 12 years, ending in 1974, when Stern became a federal judge at age 36. Packed into that interval are triumphs that explode from the page like firecrackers, chronicling one of the great law enforcement records of the past half-century.\n\nSo I invited the judge to dinner to learn more about how he sustained his relentless quest despite opposition from politicians and bureaucrats, and what he thought of the current state of law enforcement. Naturally, we met at the Post House. Over the lamb chops, Stern wasn\u2019t coy, stating \u201cI would have gone after the Wall Street firms far harder than the authorities did, including using criminal indictments against the banks themselves if necessary. They were making billions selling mortgages to the public that they knew were bad.\u201d At the same time, he blames the system for filling our jails with addicts, diverting money and time from chasing the big-time criminals. He strongly advocates de-criminalizing marijuana and most other drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s undermining the public\u2019s faith in our laws,\u201d says Stern. \u201cIt\u2019s the practice of imposing laws from the bottom of society and not the top.\u201d\n\nMost of all, I wanted to know where he found the fire to barrel through case after case. \u201cHow could you not?\u201d he replies. \u201cI found myself in the most corrupt state in the nation. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d I also was intrigued by how Stern handled prosecuting so many politicians who had returned from World War II as heroes, only to fall prey to a culture of bribery and extortion. \u201cI had to show juries that I revered their service as brave soldiers,\u201d says Stern. \u201cIn other circumstances, I would have asked for their autographs. But I also argued they\u2019d betrayed the memories of the heroes they\u2019d left behind on the battlefields of Europe and the islands of the Pacific.\u201d\n\nDiary of a DA opens in early 1962 when Stern is sworn in as an Assistant District Attorney in New York City. \u201cThey give you a badge with your name on it. It looks just like a detective shield, only it isn\u2019t,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s not official. But it\u2019s good for showing friends, particularly girls.\u201d In an early case, Stern is asked to prosecute a famous composer and conductor who\u2019s been sending out letters trying to arrange orgies. At our dinner, as in the book, Stern declined to give the musician\u2019s name. Stern thought the case was ridiculous, and managed to settle it quietly while keeping the affair out of the newspapers. The conductor, Stern remarks in the book, \u201cthinks his lawyer did a great job. And he did.\u201d Meaning Herb Stern.\n\nThroughout Diary of a DA, Stern draws a sharp distinction between \u201cdoing law and doing justice.\u201d In 1972, the Nixon Administration, with the endorsement of FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, launched a crusade against anti-war activists. A Justice Department mole, masquerading as a peacenik, provided burglar tools and cash to a group of priests and other dissidents, which they used to break into a Selective Service Office and destroy records. Hoover personally requested that Stern\u2019s office, renowned for its aggressiveness, handle the prosecution.\n\nMORE: The copyright case that brought Costco and MoMA together\n\nIn the highly publicized \u201cCamden 28\u201d case, the blithe defendants were playing guitars in the hallways on breaks. Stern\u2019s lawyers let the peaceniks say whatever they wanted, and were far from displeased when the jury dismissed all charges. The defendants and spectators chanted \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d as the foreman announced the verdict. Years later, at the funeral the Stern deputy who tried the case, Stern learned that a priest who was one of the Camden 28 insisted on assisting at the mass. That priest, quips Stern in Diary of a DA, needs to attend another funeral to express gratitude for his acquittal \u2014 Herb Stern\u2019s.\n\nIn another early case, Stern wanted to indict a police officer who pulled a pistol when a driver refused to pull over, and, in a fit of anger, fired at the car, killing a pedestrian. But in those days, the District Attorney\u2019s office zealously protected cops, and barred Stern from prosecuting. Stern was appalled, and said so. The conflict caused severe tension between Stern and his bosses, and convinced the young prosecutor he should leave the DA\u2019s office. \u201cFortunately, that practice of protecting police officers when they commit crimes would never happen today,\u201d says Stern.\n\nBut before he departs, Stern is dancing in a Manhattan club, \u201cbouncing up and down,\u201d as he puts it, on a Sunday afternoon when he overhears a fellow reveller say that Malcolm X has just been murdered. As it happens, Stern is the Assistant DA on duty that day for Manhattan and is pretty relaxed, since Sundays are generally a quiet time in the law enforcement world. Stern assigns detectives to interview dozens of the 300 or 400 people who crowded Harlem\u2019s Audubon Ballroom when three gunmen fired on Malcolm. Within two weeks, Stern had all three, militant members of the Black Muslims, in custody.\n\nThe book contains excerpts from Stern\u2019s interview with Malcolm\u2019s widow, Betty Shabazz, who was basically stonewalled Stern\u2019s inquiry. \u201cShe clearly didn\u2019t trust law enforcement people,\u201d says Stern. Years later, Shabazz entered Stern\u2019s courtroom in a case against a record company that was using Malcolm\u2019s voice. After finding in her favor, Stern asked Shabazz, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d She replied, \u201cI certainly do, and you\u2019re more mellow now.\u201d\n\nIn late 1965, Stern joined the Department of Justice as an Assistant US Attorney, rising to become US Attorney for all of New Jersey in 1971, at age 34. At the time, mayors and officialS in Newark and other cities, many of them former war heroes, were taking bribes from contractors, orchestrating scams with mobsters who inspired the malefactors in the Sopranos, and forcing city employs to pay a percentage of their paychecks into their coffers. Senator Clifford Case declared that the \u201cstate left a stench in the nostrils of the nation.\u201d The culture of corruption crossed party lines in a bi-partisan travesty of the rule of law.\n\nMORE: A tale of money, sex and power\n\nStarting with a case against a crooked union official suspected of accepting bribes on a pipeline project, Stern developed a template he\u2019d use time and time again. He subpoenaed the financial records of the contractors, and looked for checks written to cash around the time the contracts were awarded. He then deposed the executives under oath, many of whom confessed to distributing envelopes stuffed with cash to union leaders and politicians.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Stern convicted the mayors of Newark, Jersey City, and Atlantic City, a congressman, the governor\u2019s chief aid, and numerous mobsters. In a hilarious vignette, he prods one Anthony Russo to disclose his nickname to the jury. \u201cLittle Pussy\u201d exclaims the mobster sheepishly. One juror became so excited by the revelations at one trial that Stern thought his bow tie would start spinning like a helicopter blade and lift him from the juror\u2019s box.\n\nStern also encountered a Jersey-style French Connection. The case wasn\u2019t the same as the drug caper that inspired the celebrated movie, but the intrigue was even more dramatic. In 1971, an operative for the French intelligence service, the SDECE, was arrested for smuggling 100 pound of heroin into Port Elizabeth, hidden in the panels of a VW camper. He quickly talked, charging that the chief of the service, a Colonel Fournier, had ordered him to make the delivery. The French first denied Fournier existed, then admitted he existed but was completely innocent. Stern indicted Fournier, and publicly demanded he be sent to the US to stand trial. The French minister of defense accused Stern of creating \u201ca serialized novel.\u201d French President Pompidou called President Nixon and threatened to call off a scheduled meeting between the two leaders in the Azores unless Stern stopped making his demands. Stern did quiet down, but kept pursuing the case.\n\nStern was summoned to Paris, where he spent three days with the Ambassador, Arthur Watson, son of the IBM IBM legend Thomas Watson. The ambassador even led him into a room lined with heavy plastic so they wouldn\u2019t be bugged. Watson eventually sided with Stern.

Now, four years since its inception, Instagram has given birth to the first printed book of art photography.

        "text": "How is your work at txteagle changing the world for the better through technology?\n\nMobile phone subscribers in emerging markets spend on average 10% of their annual income on mobile phone airtime. By providing people with free airtime in exchange for completing a survey or engaging with a brand, we're enabling people in emerging markets to keep the money they would have spent on airtime in their pocket.\n\nHow has the company developed and how big can it become?\n\nThrough partnerships with over 220 mobile phone carriers, txteagle has created a database of over 2.1 billion emerging-market consumers, whom it can reach using proprietary messaging protocols and a unique airtime compensation platform. As a result, txteagle provides global brands direct access to their next billion consumers. What do rural Chinese doctors think about fruit juice? Can Brazilian teenagers be incentivized to buy a specific brand of shoe with group coupons? Do local merchants in Bangalore have regular access to the internet?\n\nThis is such a massive opportunity because of global brands' passion to reach emerging-market consumers. Brands are currently spending $120 billion a year on advertising in emerging markets, and that number is projected to grow to $210 billion by 2015. But they're not spending it well. At the moment, they don't have the consumer data to do the kind of targeted advertising that has become mainstream in developed markets. They can't use coupons and other basic tools of engagement in emerging markets because there typically isn't technology at the point of sale. Txteagle's unique ability to identify, engage and incentivize billions of emerging-market consumers presents almost boundless potential interest on the part of hungry advertisers. And it creates an enormous opportunity for a serious portion of those dollars to go direct to those consumers, who, as I like to say, could effectively get a 5% \"raise.\"\n\nDoes txteagle have the power to influence the way we work in the developed world, as it is does in the developing world? In the developed world, we, too, spend quite a bit of our income on mobile phones! So the idea of airtime compensation has a lot of untapped potential, including in exchange for consumer opinions, brand engagement, etc. But the opportunity in emerging markets is so enormous that we're focused on that pretty exclusively for now.\n\nIs there untapped potential in mobile technology's ability to alleviate poverty?\n\nAbsolutely. The role of the mobile phone has been vastly under-appreciated in the context of economic development. People tend to focus on whether surfing the Web, making phone calls, and sending text messages and emails are potentially transformative activities. But mobile phones not only provide a mechanism for global communication, they also allow for global compensation.\n\nMobile phones can catapult empowerment in ways we haven't even begun to imagine. For now, the passion (and the dollars) are coming from global advertisers \u2013 which will enable us to prove the power of airtime compensation. But once unleashed, that's a tool with infinite possibility. Compensation via mobile phones will ultimately provide supplemental income to a significant fraction of the global population.\n\nWhat can other innovators learn from your experiences? What do you know now that you wish you knew five years ago?\n\nLessons learned through failure can often turn into a competitive advantage. Learn these lessons as often as you can stomach!\n\nMy main lesson has been around the patience to match innovation to the receptive environment. My original, and abiding, passion is around economic empowerment via airtime compensation. It took me some time to learn to phase that vision: prove it first in partnership with advertisers, and then tap its potential in the infinite other ways people earn compensation. But it's the right lesson. Innovation doesn't exist in a vacuum; it's about matching it to people's needs with just the right timing.\n\nWhere is txteagle headed, what are your long term aims?\n\nMy ultimate goal at txteagle is to re-route 30% of the money spent on mass advertising in the developing world to the individual consumers themselves\u2014 meanwhile helping brands build loyalty, and helping consumers get the goods and services they want. As I mentioned above, if we succeed, 1 billion people will effectively have a 5% raise \u2014 plus a better consumer marketplace to enrich their lives. txteagle is partnering with several of the world's largest global brands and advertising companies to make this vision real.\n\nFinally, what can we expect from you at the Guardian's Activate Summit?\n\nI'm delighted to have the opportunity to be on the closing keynote panel. I'll also be on the lookout for global brands who wish to cultivate consumer insights, engagement, and loyalty in emerging markets.",

        "text": "When Boston officials suddenly closed the dilapidated bridge from Quincy to Long Island in October, displacing hundreds of homeless people, the clock started ticking for Jack Connors.\n\nThe ad mogul-turned-philanthropist has overseen Camp Harbor View, a summer camp for urban kids on the island, for nearly eight years. But with the bridge gone, Connors\u2019 renowned money-raising and arm-twisting skills are being put to the test. The camp\u2019s foundation has to secure two ferry boats, rebuild a pier, and ensure that underwater lines for power and water make it to the island before 450 children arrive in July.\n\nIf Connors is nervous, he isn\u2019t showing it.\n\nA few weeks ago, Connors dug into his fat Rolodex and started calling on deep-pocketed donors who could help cover roughly a half-million dollars in new expenses incurred by the sudden need for water travel. By hitting up previous Camp Harbor View contributors as well as some new ones, Connors said, he hopes to plug the gap by April. He\u2019s bracing for the worst: It could take four years or more before a new bridge is built.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise an extra $500,000 [per summer] for all these extra costs, for as many years as it\u2019s going to take,\u201d Connors said. \u201cWe have some multiyear commitments [already]. A couple have said they\u2019ll keep doing it until the bridge is back.\u201d\n\nConnors\u2019s progress so far shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. After all, it was the Boston business community\u2019s generosity that built Camp Harbor View seven years ago. Then-Mayor Thomas M. Menino had reached out to Connors to address the violence plaguing some neighborhoods in Boston. Connors remembered seeing a field on Long Island when he visited as a child and proposed to Menino that the city-owned property with one-of-a-kind views be turned into a summer day camp.\n\nConnors manned the phones, and the dollars poured in. The Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston was tapped to run the camp and oversee its programs. Nearly $7 million paid for site work, fields, and construction of the camp\u2019s \u201cgreat hall\u201d for its first year, in 2007. (Connors, of course, was a key donor himself.) Another $11 million flowed during subsequent years for other capital projects, such as a 150-foot pier and a swimming pool.\n\nThen there\u2019s the camp\u2019s operating costs \u2014 last year, the budget was about $3 million \u2014 primarily funded through a gala that draws hundreds every June. Some of the city\u2019s top rainmakers, such people as Suffolk Construction\u2019s John Fish and Steward Health Care\u2019s Ralph de la Torre, have lined up to help sell tickets for the event. This year, EMC chief executive Joe Tucci joins Connors as cochairmen of the gala.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the camp is running low on cash. Connors built up a $6.3 million endowment over the years. About half of that came from Partners HealthCare, the giant hospital group where Connors served as board chairman. Connors said the endowment\u2019s purpose is to ensure the camp survives long after he\u2019s gone \u2014 not to navigate a short-term emergency.\n\nCara Gould, senior executive director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, said most of the 900 kids, ages 11 through 14, who get to attend the camp\u2019s four-week sessions each July and August spend the bulk of their young lives within a three-block radius of their homes. They live just miles away from the ocean, she said, but might never see the sun glint off the waves if not for Camp Harbor View.\n\nThe first day of camp in 2007.\n\n\u201cBringing them to this island, it\u2019s like bringing them to another world, even though it\u2019s 20 minutes away,\u201d Gould said.\n\nTo pull that off without a bridge, Connors and company need a boat \u2014 a really big boat. That\u2019s why the foundation reached an agreement last month with Bay State Cruise Co. to use its slow-speed Provincetown II ferry, at a cost of $200,000 for the season. There\u2019s more than enough room to make daily trips for the campers.\n\nBut one boat won\u2019t be enough. Connors needed another vessel for the kids who miss the morning boat and the catering crew that will cook the hot lunches. That\u2019s where the 60-person Miss Peddocks Island comes in. Connors said he is paying $120,000 for the season to two brothers for use of their vessel.\n\nSo far, so good. But the boats need a place to land. Connors wants to use the state-owned Squantum Point pier in Quincy, not far from where the Long Island bridge is located. Unfortunately for Connors, the pier was badly damaged in a nor\u2019easter in October. A spokesman for the Department of Conservation and Recreation said the state agency hopes to reopen the pier in time for summer.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of utilities. NStar expects to disconnect power to Long Island this month as part of the demolition project.The bridge also carries water and phone lines between Quincy and the island. Those will be gone, too. But city officials say they\u2019ve given a contractor a deadline of June 15 to install utility lines in the seabed.\n\nThe variables have prompted Connors and his team to have backup plans: installing on-site electricity generators, using the island\u2019s old water tower, boarding at the World Trade Center pier where the Provincetown II is normally docked. But these solutions could cost more in terms of time or money, in part for the extra barge trips.\n\nGould, the Boys and Girls Clubs executive, said she\u2019s not worried about the remaining logistical headaches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a long time ago,\u201d Gould said, \u201cthat with Jack Connors behind you, things happen.\u201d\n\nThe Camp Harbor View foundation, spearheaded by Jack Connors, has to secure an extra $500,000 to run two ferry boats, rebuild a pier, and ensure underwater lines for power and water make it to Long Island before 450 children arrive in July.",

        "text": "Sunday, the Boston Classical Orchestra, conducted by Steven Lipsitt, acknowledges a milestone \u2014 the group\u2019s 35th season \u2014 with a program including Joseph Haydn\u2019s Symphony No. 35. The symphony was written in 1767, the first full year Haydn (pictured) spent living at Esterh\u00e1za, the elaborate palace Haydn\u2019s patron and employer, Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy, built on the grounds of a hunting lodge near the Austro-Hungarian border. How elaborate? Work on Esterh\u00e1za would continue into the 1780s, at the eventual cost of some 13 million gulden. Converting Austro-Hungarian gulden is not the most straightforward task, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation, based on comparisons with average Viennese wages then and now, puts Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s cost, in modern dollars, well into the billions.\n\nThe dean of Haydn scholarship, H.C. Robbins Landon, plausibly speculated that the Symphony No. 35 was composed to welcome Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy home following a trip to Paris. That journey, too, involved Esterh\u00e1za: in search of new and interesting ways to spend lavishly on a residence, Nikolaus and his architect visited Versailles, another hunting lodge expanded into exceptional grandeur. However, the visit may have been somewhat anticlimactic, judging from the impressions of someone else who happened to be at Versailles in fall 1767: Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHaving been sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly (for a second time) to combat the Penn family\u2019s machinations, Franklin \u2014 accompanied by Sir John Pringle (future physician to George III) \u2014 made time for a French sojourn. Already renowned for his scientific achievements, Franklin was presented to the current monarch, Louis XV, whom Franklin described to his London friend Mary Stevenson as having \u201ca very lively look.\u201d Versailles itself, though, was less lively. The elaborate waterworks were \u201cout of Repair\u201d; elsewhere, Franklin saw \u201cshabby half Brick Walls and broken Windows.\u201d Versailles and Paris, Franklin concluded, were \u201ca prodigious Mixture of Magnificence and Negligence.\u201d\n\nThe dinginess failed to deter Nikolaus\u2019s ambition; Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s unrestrained splendor earned it the nickname of the \u201cHungarian Versailles.\u201d In the end, though, and like Versailles, Esterh\u00e1za became a museum. After Nikolaus\u2019s death in 1790, Anton Esterh\u00e1zy, his successor, decided that Esterh\u00e1za was too isolated for his taste. Anton\u2019s hobbies were more geological than musical; the extensive musical establishment Nikolaus had assembled was abruptly dismantled. It worked out well for Haydn, at least \u2014 freed from Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s continuous demands, the composer was f\u00eated in cities across Europe. Haydn, the palace-bound courtier, became Haydn, the musical citizen of the world.\n\nThe Boston Classical Orchestra, conducted by Steven Lipsitt, and featuring cellist Meehae Ryo and violinist In Mo Yang, performs music of Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart, Dec. 14 at 3 p.m. at Faneuil Hall (tickets $19-$74; 866-811-4111; www.bostonclassicalorchestra.org).",

        "text": "Best game: Bucks 92, Bulls 90.\n\nThe Bulls literally handed the game to the Bucks.\n\nTwenty-eight turnovers from Chicago is a lot. It's the most turnovers Chicago has had in a game this season, in fact. And it's probably not surprising that Milwaukee would be the team to create such havoc. The Bucks' long-armed defenders employ a switch-heavy scheme that offensive players aren't completely used to seeing yet, with the strong-side pressure defense of Tom Thibodeau still preferred by many teams. And it works for Milwaukee; the Bucks led the league in opponent turnover percentage this season.\n\nSo, yes, the 28 turnovers from the Bulls were a lot. The 39 points Milwaukee generated off those turnovers were a lot, too. But one instance loomed larger than any other on the night.\n\nDerrick Rose brought the Bulls back with some stellar play in the final two minutes after struggling for much of the night. But with the game-winning shot Rose's for the taking, Khris Middleton stripped Rose and earned one final possession for Milwaukee with 1.3 seconds remaining. And, well, Jason Kidd drew this up and Jerryd Bayless executed:\n\nGame over. Milwaukee stays alive. And a big night from Jimmy Butler (see below) is all for naught.\n\nBest stat line: Stephen Curry, G, Warriors: 39 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists, 6-of-8 on 3's.\n\nWe're all going to need to become much more creative, because Curry will have us all out of superlatives sooner or later.\n\nCurry seems an affable chap, and it comes through in his reputation as a fan favorite. More than once, we've heard how Curry is the role model to which young girls and boys can aspire. No one can ever work so hard that he or she grows up to be 7 feet tall. But the exquisite shooting accuracy and deft ball-handling of Curry seem attainable, if only we work hard enough.\n\nDon't let the nature of the gifts fool you: Curry is ruthless. He's shown a knack this season for delivering when his opponents take their game to the next level \u2014 in game or across the country on the night before, and here, we're talking about you, James Harden. Curry is not to be outdone by anyone (except maybe Klay Thompson), and Saturday night was no exception, as the Warriors beat the Pelicans 109-98 to complete a first-round sweep.\n\nAnthony Davis put up another monster performance with 36 points and 11 rebounds. Against anyone else, it's the best stat line of the night, and the Pelicans go home with a win. But Curry isn't anyone else. He's the likely MVP, a star equally likely to bury a dagger or throw a pass that would make Magic Johnson get out of his seat and shimmy.\n\nOne can never discount the King as he reigns in Cleveland. But on nights like Saturday, it's hard to believe this long season belongs to anyone but Steph Curry.\n\nBest stat line, pt. 2: Jimmy Butler, G, Bulls: 33 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 3 steals.\n\nIf the Bulls are just going to keep alternating massive games from Butler and Rose, this team has a chance to make the Eastern Conference finals. But a bit of balance could go a long way toward Chicago surprising Cleveland and Atlanta and earning a spot in the NBA Finals, and it could have earned the Bulls a sweep on Saturday.\n\nIn a helter-skelter Game 4, Butler stood head and shoulders above every other player on the floor. No one came close to matching his 33 points \u2014 the second-highest scorer in the game, O.J. Mayo, scored just 18 points. But there's more to glean from that difference than might first meet the eye. One of the biggest reasons no Buck could hold a candle to Butler was Butler's outstanding defense on whomever the Bulls needed him to guard. In fact, Milwaukee had its greatest success when it ran out a lineup with Mayo, Jared Dudley and Jerryd Bayless, too many Bucks shooters for Butler to guard on his own.\n\nThe Bulls struggled with turnovers, and Butler coughed it up four times. But he was forced to assume much of the playmaking burden because of a quiet Rose (14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, 8 turnovers to 6 assists), so a handful of turnovers can be forgiven.\n\nMilwaukee staved off elimination for at least one more game thanks in large part to those turnovers (see below). But when Bucks fans are asked which Bull put the fear of summer vacation into them, they'll have but one answer: The Butler did it.\n\nBest individual play that symbolizes a Warriors sweep and the future of the NBA: Stephen Curry hits a ridiculous step-back jumper over the outstretched arm of Anthony Davis.\n\nSeriously, there is no better metaphor for where the NBA is, where the NBA is going, and this single first-round series than this shot:\n\nThe Pelicans were game in each of the four contests in the series. They nearly overcame insurmountable deficits, and they gave away a 20-point advantage in Game 3 that will haunt New Orleans fans for a while. And all of it was because of Davis. He couldn't have done it without Tyreke Evans or Ryan Anderson or any of the other Pelicans who stepped up, but it was The Brow who kept New Orleans within arm's reach for four incredibly entertaining games.\n\nAnd Curry and the Warriors were just out of reach each time, coming up with plays out of nowhere that broke the backs and dreams of the Pelicans.\n\nThis one goes to the Warriors. But it's safe to say that we haven't seen the last of Curry vs. Davis.\n\nBest quote: Steve Kerr has seen the future, and it is The Brow.\n\nSteve Kerr on A.D.: \"The guy will be the MVP within in the next few years, I think.\"\n\nBest impersonation of your opponent: The Nets became the Hawks to beat the Hawks.\n\nMaybe Brooklyn as a basketball entity is just a giant chameleon, and playing in the Eastern Conference meant that the Nets took on a bad basketball environment and reflected it in their own play. Introduce a passing machine like the Hawks into Brooklyn's home environment, however, and the Nets turn into a whirling buzzsaw of passes and finishes at the rim.\n\nCan we talk about that Brooklyn home environment for a second, though? Granted, Saturday's game was a pretty early start. But this isn't the greatest showing in playoff fan history, Nets supporters.\n\nBest picture that is clearly not at all a foul: Zach Randolph and Robin Lopez are besties.\n\nListen, referees will let marginal contact go if it doesn't create an advantage for either player, and this collision between Randolph and Lopez is clearly nothing out of the ordinary. It's just two very, very large men trying to get a rebound. Nothing to see here. Next play!\n\nUnlike Lopez, Blazers fans are likely anxiously tugging at their collars, as Saturday night's 115-109 loss to the Grizzlies leaves Portland in 3-0 first-round hole.\n\nBest insight into why Mike Budenholzer is the Coach of the Year: Budenholzer started to draw up a play, decided against it.\n\nThe sign of a true genius is the ability to recognize that simplicity is best. Sure, you could desperately design some crazy set to try to get your team back into the swing of things on the road. Or you could trust the system, shrug your shoulders, and say, \"Let's just play.\"\n\nIt didn't work out in the end for the Hawks, but it was a refreshing glimpse of a coach conceding that sometimes you just need to let players make plays.\n\nBest visual: Kosta Koufos jams all over C.J. McCollum.\n\nCredit to McCollum for putting his body and pride on the line here, but this highlight is not for the faint of heart.\n\nBest use of film study to make an opponent sad: Bojan Bogdanovic perfectly read a Hawks play, got the steal.\n\nTechnology has changed the NBA.\n\nIt's perhaps an under-discussed part of the way the league has evolved, but film study is easier today than it's ever been \u2014 and it's becoming even easier by the day. A player can fire up Synergy on the plane, in the locker room, at the hotel, hell, even on the bench. Whenever and wherever he is so inclined to study, the material is always available.\n\nThat easy access to information makes each and every player who chooses to use it that much smarter and that much more prepared. And it makes going up against such thoroughly informed defenses all the more difficult. Banning hand-checking on the perimeter undoubtedly opened up the game, and that maybe made things easier for elite wing scorers to get past the first line of defense. But once that primary defender is in the dust, an entire system of switches and hedges, of helping and communicating, waits to swallow up all but the very best offensive efforts.\n\nIt might seem that this is a simple steal from Brooklyn's Bogdanovic, on a missed opportunity by Atlanta. But note the switch Bogdanovic makes based on what he knows of the Hawks offense and his faith in the information he's gathered and the studying he's done.\n\nHours and hours of work likely went into that one play. In the playoffs, it's all worth it.\n\nBest improvisation that was completely ineffective and thoroughly hilarious: Leandro Barbosa throws a pass to no one to avoid a travel.\n\nIt might have been better to just suck it up and take the up-and-down violation on this one, Brazilian Blur. But thank you for sacrificing your pride for the sake of the people's entertainment.\n\nBest at being the worst: Aaron Brooks got up close and personal with Jerryd Bayless.\n\nLet it never be said that you have to be a big human being to turn a basketball game into a chippy affair. Brooks is generously listed as 6 feet tall, but he has no problem playing the instigator.\n\nBrooks picked up three fouls in just six minutes, including a flagrant for the shove on Bayless.\n\nBest blatant disregard for the mid-quarter entertainment during a game: Joey Crawford has places to be, people!\n\nListen, elderly Nets dancers, we understand that you're just trying to thrill the crowd with your choreographed shenanigans. But Crawford needs to get from here to over there, and he doesn't have time to wait for you. There's basketball to be officiated.\n\nBest wishes to a player after a scary injury: Mike Conley suffers blow to the head, taken to medical facility.\n\nHere's hoping that the Grizzlies point guard make a speedy and full recovery after an inadvertent elbow from C.J.

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 When Joe Stinziano, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics, took the stage recently at a press event on the future of smart TV, few might have expected him to talk about the quietest device in the living room: the remote control. \u201cUntil now, the remote control has basically stayed the same for 50 years,\u201d Stinziano said, before proceeding to unveil a bevy of innovative new features.\n\nIndeed, Stinziano cast a spotlight on a device that may very well be the last piece of home entertainment equipment to undergo broad, fundamental change. Hampered by manufacturing costs, infrastructure, and competing technical standards, the remote control has gotten little attention even though the average household now has four of them, each with its own confusing array of buttons and services. What changes remote controls have gone through have mostly been evolutionary. That may be starting to change.\n\nWhy has the remote control been a long-time victim of innovation? \u201cIt\u2019s always come secondary to the television or set top box it\u2019s been paired with,\u201d says Michel Alvarez who was lead designer when Boxee TV, a progressive home theater PC software application, developed its flagship set-top box and dual-sided remote. \u201cAs manufacturers continued to invest production costs on making sure the main unit delivered on its competitive features, remote control innovation sat on the back burner, ultimately plateauing the relationship between the remote and the television.\u201d\n\nMORE: The mistake Netflix is making now\n\nIt didn\u2019t start that way. The first wireless remote was a marvel, introduced by Zenith Radio Corporation in 1956 and engineered by Robert Adler. Called the \u201cZenith Space Command,\u201d it offered a simple interface, consistent with consumer habits for watching television at the time. With its introduction an evolution happened: choice or remotes was granted to consumers for the first time. Findings emerged that began to shape programming: 25% of viewers changed the channel once the credits started rolling since they could change the channel sitting down. Yet by the turn of the century, the remote\u2019s design faltered under the weight of multiple systems. Not only did it multiply by device \u2014 while one remote shipped with a TV, another shipped with the cable box \u2014 but the separation of labor and service provider caused an unstoppable multiplicity of buttons.\n\nZenith 300With the introduction of new services to the living room \u2014 VCRs, DVRs, DVD and Blu-ray players, game consoles \u2014 device infraction emerged on the coffee table because each new box pack its own remote. And while universal remotes intended to unite the confounding multiple experiences, it was often a less usable version of simple versions from manufacturers.\n\nAnd there wasn\u2019t much incentive to focus on the problem. \u201cMid- and low-end TV sales are very sensitive to margins, and so many manufacturers effectively gave up trying to own the entire experience and focused on lowering manufacturing cost and on investing in picture quality,\u201d says Jun Lee, a partner at ReD Associates, an innovation and strategy consultancy, \u201cThey reduced the price of remote control manufacturing to $1 for the average remote to $3-5 for a \u2018premium\u2019 remote, but they also knew the remote was no longer a primary point of contact between their customers and the TV viewing experience.\u201d\n\nMORE: 5 things that mattered at SXSW\n\nThere is a chief difference, however, between cable or TV manufacturers (where remote controls are often an afterthought) and the business of making remote controls. Take Logitech LOGI , who for 30 years has been making personal peripherals. These devices win design awards year after year. \u201cWe have customers come in to our office on a weekly basis, says Kevin Simon, director of Product Research. \u201cPeople often don\u2019t know what they want or what their pain points are.\u201d As part of their process, they do a combination of lab studies at their headquarters, ethnographic studies, and traditional surveys. Even the Harmony Link, one of their remotes on the market, effectively crowdsources live behaviors so that each new addition becomes available for Harmony Link users everywhere.\n\nThings could be turning around. Two non-traditional remotes have recently put better control in front of consumers, effectively raising expectations for gesture and voice. First the Kinect, a Microsoft MSFT Xbox remote that supports both voice and gesture input without a device at all. Apple\u2019s AAPL Siri, which shipped with the iPhone 4S, recognizes voice commands, and helped result in $46.33 billion in revenue by the end of 2011 just a few months after it was introduced. And if history is any evidence, Siri has already changed consumer expectations and behavior irreversibly. \u201cApple unified service and product on the iPhone. It may try to make a similar move on TV,\u201d says Lee.\n\nMeantime, Samsung introduced its Smart Interaction technology with face recognition, gesture, and voice control, intended to provide choice for how consumers interact with their TV. And while Samsung still supplies the Smart Touch Remote and traditional remote in the box, the way consumers can interact with them clearly tips a hat to what its voice and gestural predecessors have done well.\n\nMORE: Time to redefine \u201cinnovation\u201d\n\nBut is the advent of voice, gesture, and touch really more control for consumers in a remote? \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to pick up a remote control,\u201d says Chris Harrison, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), \u201cYou\u2019re sitting in your living room and snap your fingers. It\u2019s like clicking the button for Siri. The computer looks for whatever hand is being held out\u2014that is your remote control. Then you type \u2018Channel 52\u2019 or the top five shows you love watching on your DVR and click play. It\u2019s getting away from the paradigm of a remote control. Your whole room is interactive. That\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\n\nTogether with Microsoft Research and a CMU colleague, Harrison prototyped a mobile interaction system, OmniTouch, that turns any surface, including the human body, into a screen. Both OmniTouch, and another of his on-body interface projects, Armura, offer a new evolution of control\u2014one where human interaction with our media experience dissolves into something much simpler: the environment itself.\n\nSo what this the future of the remote control? \u201cWe need to bring great new interaction and interface design to the remote control itself, the compatibility, the crowdsourcing. We absolutely need that because that is what the customer is buying. They demand innovation when they buy our product as opposed to when they buy a cable package,\u201d Simon says. Meanwhile manufacturers will experimenting with voice, gesture, and touch and consumers will play, voting for their choice with gestures and buttons on how to put the control in the remote experience. At least finally this is an evolution, one Joe Stinziano\u2019s audience has been waiting to hear about for more than fifty years.\n\nLiz Danzico is chair and co-founder of the MFA Interaction Design program at the School of Visual Arts.

They should appear \"no more than God in nature\", he once wrote. So it was probably as well that he seldom gave interviews, because there was certainly a lot to talk about. Freud was famously gregarious, and loved the good life, including expensive food and cars. (His regular table at the Wolseley was said to be set with a black cloth last night.) And \"it is thought\", in the cautious words of this BBC profile, that he fathered \"dozens\" of children.\n\nThe legends about his ramshackle (some would say disgusting) studio were also true \u2013 as you can see from the dirt and paint that cakes the walls in this extract from Tim Meara's film Small Gestures in Bare Rooms. For a fuller profile, the best film available online is Jake Auerbach's Portraits (2004), made up of interviews with his friends and family. Part one includes, among other things, the memory of his friend, the novelist Francis Wyndham, being taken to the River Cafe in Freud's glamorous car. \"You know how frightening he can be as a driver,\" Wyndham says. In the second part, fellow artist David Hockney remembers sitting for Freud, and is full of praise for his work. \"I think they're as good portraits as have been done by anybody, actually,\" he says. The third part is here.\n\nAmong critics, the London Review of Books art writer Peter Campbell made a superbly detailed study of Freud's technique, following his visit to Tate Britain's 2002 retrospective. There is also this film on YouTube, which is far from slick \u2013 indeed it's annoyingly shoddy \u2013 but it does give a good summary of Freud's influences and development.\n\nThe Today programme this morning carried a clutch of interviews, including with Sue Tilley, the subject of several of Freud's portraits. Most notable among them was Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, which became the most expensive painting by a living artist ever sold when it was bought for \u00a317m in 2008, reportedly by Roman Abramovic at the instigation of his girlfriend, collector and millionairess Dasha Zhukova.\n\nTilley also spoke in more depth to BBC Breakfast this morning, revealing that the famously protracted process of sitting for Freud was not exaggerated \u2013 taking \"three days a week for nine months\" in her case. \"You'd think he was a very serious person,\" she adds, \"but his excitement when he met Kylie Minogue beggared belief.\"\n\nPerhaps his closest literary counterpart, when it came to documenting the grotesque glory of the human body, was John Updike.

        "text": "1. Follow the flows.New research from Stanford Graduate School of Business found evidence that many mutual managers were skilled, but highlighted the importance of finding low-fee active managers. Professors Jonathan Berk and Jules H. van Binsbergen, who has since moved to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, looked at a universe of 5,974 mutual funds from 1969 to 2011 and compared the funds' results to comparable Vanguard index funds. They found evidence of skill\u2014outperformers continued outperforming over time. The researchers also found that the skilled managers attracted more assets\u2014and, in fact, very quickly. If you have a pot of money to invest and are seeking an actively managed fund, one basis you could use to pick is the fund flows, if you're on top of the latest data on at least a quarterly basis, said Berk.\n\n2. Look for fees under 1 percent on actively managed U.S. equity funds. The research also showed that one of the reasons it's been so difficult for experts and investing services to find skilled mutual fund managers is that they charge so much in fees. But at least you know they're out there.\n\nOn average, actively managed equity funds charged investors 1.37 percent in expense ratios in 2013, according to the Investment Company Institute. That's down from 1.6 percent in 2000. On an asset-weighted basis, the decline has been even more significant, because investors have been pouring money into the lowest-priced funds.\n\nIt is possible to find good money managers charging less than 1 percent. In fact, that's what individual investors should look for, suggested Ram Lee, president at New York City-based Seven Bridges Advisors, which has $3.8 billion in assets and offers CIO services to institutions, individuals and families. A lower fee gives you a much better chance of beating the market and is also a sign that a fund company and a manager are aware of the way the wind is blowing: toward lower-priced funds. Rekenthaler's list of five active funds worth a look (included below) all have expense ratios substantially under 1 percent, except for the American Funds' New World Fund, which comes in right above 1 percent.\n\n3. Understand that it's progressively harder for good managers to deliver good returns. In his first five years managing Fidelity's Magellan Fund, according to Berk's paper, famous fund manager Peter Lynch had a 2 percent monthly gross alpha on average assets of about $40 million. In his last five years, his outperformance was only 20 basis points per month on assets that ultimately grew to more than $10 billion.\n\nLynch still had the same level of skill; he just was spreading it thinner. \"As the capital flows in, the alpha goes down,\" said Berk.\n\nAs their funds become larger, managers cannot always find the amount of stock they need in all the right companies to build stellar portfolios for all their clients. That leads to the next idea: You need to know how much money the manager is managing.\n\nThe prospectus will include the total in the fund in which you're investing. But according to Lee, many managers use the same strategy to invest assets outside the fund. So you'll probably want to email the mutual fund company and ask if the manager is also managing assets for institutions. \"Anything above $25 billion is a lot,\" he said.\n\n4. Don't expect the game to be easy. Investors such as Lee personally interview managers and hone their analysis and instincts. Lee, for instance, looks for managers who try to beat the market by understanding downside risk and those who have a system for how they pick the companies they invest in. \"We focus a lot on repeatability of their process,\" Lee said. You won't be able to interview managers, but you can look for detailed letters that describe fund holdings and the manager's strategy.\n\nRekenthaler said it's only in some bear markets that active managers ability to control downside risk has a benefits. \"In 2008, active managers did not do better than indexes. But in 2000 to 2002, the market dropped a lot, led by high-priced tech stocks. A lot of active managers that outperformed substantially avoided the one big market sector, technology.\"\n\nOne thing Lee doesn't look at: labels, like growth vs.value. Those labels are determined by a fund's holdings and thus can easily change even within a year.\n\n5. Finally, don't forget the taxes. Many professional investors look for managers who aim to buy and hold companies for the long term, so take a look at the fund turnover, too. \"On taxable portfolios, the tax consequences of a high-turnover approach\" could erase any of the returns you've earned above the market, said Jonathan Blau, CEO of Fusion Family Wealth.",

The researchers also found that the skilled managers attracted more assets\u2014and, in fact, very quickly.",

His gravitational pull was so strong that even Drake had no choice but collaborate with him on the summer release \u201cWhat a Time to Be Alive.\u201d\n\nWhen Future sat down with DJ Khaled Friday night on the first episode of Khaled\u2019s new Beats 1 Radio show, the agenda included more than just mutual back-patting for newly-signed, presumably lucrative deals with Apple Music (\u201cWhen I got the deal, I said, \u2018Sensational!\u2019 \u201d Future said, embodying his own meme.) Future was also set to unveil what would be his seventh project in barely over a year.\n\nKhaled, whose talent as a DJ has been overshadowed lately by his SnapChat phenomenon, had Future\u2019s latest album, \u201cEVOL,\u201d in his hands, and it was as if they both were admiring bottled lightning. The album, which was made available to preorder for release at midnight, comes three weeks ahead of his Purple Reign Tour stop in Boston on Feb. 26. It also comes barely three weeks after Future no-so-coincidentally dropped off the 13-track surprise tape, \u201cPurple Reign,\u201d just hours before his ex-fiancee Ciara\u2019s new flame, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, opened up the NFL playoffs. (The Seahawks lost; memes ensued.)\n\nFuture and Khaled talked about the meaning of the album title \u2013 \u201cLove\u201d backward, as well as evolution. But with Future\u2019s tip-toeing on the fine line between harnessing bottled-lightning inspiration and clutching onto short attention spans while he knows he has them, they also talked about how much Future music was flooding the market.\n\nFuture explained the logic behind constantly feeding fans and clubs alike. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit and have them wonder if I love them; I want to show them immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that moment it was clear that for Future, oversaturation doesn\u2019t matter if he could defy it.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t DMX in the late \u201990s, dropping three albums in 20 months (all hit No. 1), but then eventually crashing into a wall. He wasn\u2019t millennial machine Curren$y, putting six albums a year into the air like a running stream of consciousness. Future was dictating his own terms.\n\n\u201cWhen you look back at Future and his career,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to be like, he set the tone, he set the vibe for his own career.\u201d\n\nHe was more than aware that last year\u2019s \u201cDirty Sprite 2\u201d was his tipping point. On the strength of next-generation trap beats that morphed and mutated into something both sinister and soulful, \u201cDS2\u201d was unlike anything else. But in terms of narration, it was the climax of a story Future had been weaving for months. \u201cWhere Ya At\u201d was exquisite because of the way producer Metro Boomin managed to contort the strings from Stan Getz\u2019s sensuous 1960 slow-burner \u201cGoodbye\u201d into an absolute earthquake. But it was also gripping, one of the flashpoint moments when Future wasn\u2019t binging on drugs but purging the feelings of abandonment and loss that he was trying to escape.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dirty Sprite 2,\u2019 I feel like they got me,\u201d he told Khaled. \u201cI marked my territory with \u2018DS2.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cEVOL\u201d keeps listeners in the same frame, even if the emotions aren\u2019t as driven. At one point, on the album opener \u201cAin\u2019t No Time,\u201d he admits to the push and pull of his music\u2019s infectiousness and indecipherability: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we be saying / We just be yelling out, \u2018bon jour.\u2019 \u201d There\u2019s less distress, more hedonism.\n\nThe only leftover trace of whatever bitterness he may still feel shows up on \u201cLow Life,\u201d featuring the Weeknd. How Future\u2019s love-stoned spiral hasn\u2019t intersected with the Weeknd\u2019s walk-of-shame sensibilities until now is hard to fathom, but he raps shamelessly, \u201cIf she catch me cheating, I won\u2019t ever tell her sorry.\u201d\n\nFuture\u2019s still comfortable in the zone he fell into 20 months ago, so much so that he told Khaled he doesn\u2019t even remember how many albums he\u2019s released.\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to continue to build. I\u2019ve got to continue to move on.\u201d\n\nThe thing about momentum, though, is that as exciting as it is to watch it build, the inevitable question is: When will it eventually run out?",

Bouchard ruled that the social network\u2019s minority shareholders are entitled to their day in court over the salaries that Facebook\u2019s directors received.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the company\u2019s board are being sued because a shareholder thinks the pay the directors were awarded in 2013 was too high. Board members decide their own pay, but in this case, the dispute is over whether it was excessive and whether the board acted in shareholders\u2019 interests.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Zuckerberg, who owns a majority of Facebook\u2019s shares, signed an affidavit saying he approved the pay. In a deposition related to the case, he said: \u201cThese are the people who I want and\u2014and who I think will serve the company best, and I think that the compensation plan that we have is doing its job of attracting and retaining them over the long term.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s lawyers claimed that was enough under Delaware law to conclude the majority of shareholders had approved the director pay packages. That matters under Delaware law (where Facebook and many large corporations are incorporated), because unless shareholders have approved the directors\u2019 pay, the Facebook board has to show the pay was fair. But if shareholders approved board members\u2019 pay, they could rely on a presumption that they exercised sound business judgement.\n\nThe judge said not so fast. Just because Zuckerberg signed an affidavit and spoke in a deposition doesn\u2019t mean Facebook is entitled to an easier case.\n\nDelaware law is pretty loose when it comes to shareholder approval. It can be done at a shareholder meeting, by unanimous consent of shareholders, or even by majority shareholder consent \u201cwithout a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote,\u201d Bouchard wrote.\n\nBut Bouchard said protocols under the law on when Zuckerberg was speaking for shareholders matter. To use the majority shareholder consent provision, Zuckerberg not only had to make it clear for whom he was speaking and that he was entitled to speak for the majority, he also had to disclose his action to shareholders following his decision. \u201cIn the case of action taken by written consent, [shareholders are entitled] to receive prompt notice after the fact of the action taken,\u201d the judge wrote. According to the judge, these requirements protect the corporation and its shareholders.\n\nThe rights of minority shareholders are critical to corporate governance. In fact, it\u2019s one area of governance that countries across the globe have been able to agree on. It\u2019s that basic. So because minority shareholders did not get their due, including receiving notice of Zuckerberg\u2019s actions, this case is going forward, as it should.\n\nEleanor Bloxham is CEO of The Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance (http://www.thevaluealliance.com), an independent board education and advisory firm she founded in 1999.

The former Secretary of State issued a statement Monday declining to participate in the Sanders debate that was set to take place two weeks before the California primary.\n\n\"We believe that Hillary Clinton's time is best spent campaigning and meeting directly with voters across California and preparing for a general election campaign that will ensure the White House remains in Democratic hands,\" wrote Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director.\n\nSpokespeople for both the Trump and Sanders campaigns did not immediately respond to PEOPLE queries Thursday about how \u2013 or even whether \u2013 plans are proceeding to make this debate actually happen.",

In a sneak peek of this Sunday\u2019s season premiere, the Victoria\u2019s Secret model blasts Kardashian for re-gifting an iPad she gave him for Christmas to Chyna.\n\nWorsening matters, the eldest Jenner learned of the betrayal through Chyna\u2019s social media page.\n\nKYLIE JENNER AND BLAC CHYNA SHARE SELFIE\n\n\u201cRob is dating someone that has kind of had a bad history with my family and he fully re-gifted my gift,\" the brunette beauty explained in the teaser clip.\n\n\u201cOn top of it, it's so annoying to find out through social media because his girlfriend posted it. Like there's some things that just aren't cool and I don't think this is very cool,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe enraged reality star decides to call Kardashian and demand that he return the present.\n\n\u201cIt came with an iPad, a pen and a keyboard and I want it all back,\u201d she yells at him. \"Because if you're not gonna use it I have someone who actually is really dying for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne I'm annoyed, two I'm actually hurt that you re-gifted my f--king gift that I went out of the way to give you,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe former recluse goes on the attack, chiding Kendall for being \u201chilarious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's the first time you've ever got me a gift in your entire life\u201d the sock entrepreneur tells his little sister, causing her to hang up the call.\n\nThe anger isn't surprising given the divide Chyna is rumored to have created in the family since she linked up with Kardashian in January. The controversial romance stems from rapper Tyga leaving the former video vixen for the younger Kylie Jenner. The former couple have a son together.\n\nHowever, peace seems to have been orchestrated recently by big sister Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe reality starlet was surprisingly spotted on Tuesday with her brother and his bride-to-be. The reconciliation follows a digital olive branch in the form of a selfie shared by Kylie and Chyna last week.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.",
