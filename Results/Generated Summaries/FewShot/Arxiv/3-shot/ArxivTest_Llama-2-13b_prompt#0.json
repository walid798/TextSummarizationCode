        "text": "the polcor instrument is a combined imager , coronograph and polarimeter built for the nordic optical telescope ( not ) . polcor provides sharp images ( resolution down to 02 ) , has a well - defined psf ( resulting in a higher image contrast ) and a high - quality polarimeter . +    we observed three sources using polcor / not : the binary s - type agb star w  aql , and the two detached shell carbon stars u  cam and dr  ser . observations of the polarized light around the stars trace the circumstellar dust distribution and thus enables the search for structures and asymmetries in the circumstellar envelope . though this study the geometry of the mass loss can be investigated which will give important clues not only to the processes at play , but also to the transition from the agb phase to the planetary nebula phase . the circumstellar dust distribution around the binary star w aql is mapped and found to be asymmetric , both on large ( 10  ) and on smaller ( 1  ) scales ( fig .  1 ) . the large - scale images show what appears to be a dust - density enhancement on the south - west side of the star and the inner region appears bi - polar through the coronographic mask . these structures are in agreement with what could be expected from binary interaction .\n",
        "generated": "The Polcor instrument on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) has been used to study the polarized light around three sources: the binary S-type AGB star W Aql, and the two detached shell carbon stars U Cam and DR Ser. The instrument provides sharp images with high contrast and high-quality polarimetry, allowing for the mapping of the circumstellar dust distribution and the investigation of the geometry of mass loss. The study found asymmetries in the dust distribution around W Aql on both large and small scales, consistent with expectations from binary interaction.Keywords: Polcor, NOT, binary stars, AGB stars, carbon stars, circumstellar dust, mass loss, asymmetries.",
        "summary": "stellar light from an agb star is scattered by the circumstellar dust and polarized in the direction perpendicular to the source .  therefore , images of circumstellar envelopes around agb stars in polarized light traces the dust distribution and can be used to search for asymmetries , and to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms at play when agb stars are transformed into planetary nebulae .  the polcor instrument is a combined imager , polarimeter , and coronograph providing images with an angular resolution down to 02 .  we have used it to map the dust distribution around three agb stars : w  aql , and the detached shell sources dr  ser , and u  cam .  w  aql is a binary and we find indications of a bi - polar dust distribution around the star .  the observations of the latter two sources clearly reveal the detached shells , likely the result of a brief , strongly enhanced mass - loss rate during the late evolution of these stars .  mapping the detached shells gives us clues to the symmetry of the mass loss and important evolutionary processes .\n"
