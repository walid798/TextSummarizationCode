        "generated": "The PolCOR Instrument: A Combined Imager, Coronograph, and Polarimeter for Studying Circumstellar Dust DistributionsIntroduction:The PolCOR instrument is a state-of-the-art imaging and polarimetric instrument designed for the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). It provides high-resolution images with a resolution of 0.2 arcseconds, a well-defined point spread function (PSF), and a high-quality polarimeter. In this article, we present the results of observations made with PolCOR of three sources: the binary S-type AGB star W Aql, and the detached shell carbon stars U Cam and DR Ser.Observations of Polarized Light:The observations made with PolCOR allowed us to study the circumstellar dust distribution around these stars and search for structures and asymmetries in the circumstellar",
        "summary": "stellar light from an agb star is scattered by the circumstellar dust and polarized in the direction perpendicular to the source .  therefore , images of circumstellar envelopes around agb stars in polarized light traces the dust distribution and can be used to search for asymmetries , and to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms at play when agb stars are transformed into planetary nebulae .  the polcor instrument is a combined imager , polarimeter , and coronograph providing images with an angular resolution down to 02 .  we have used it to map the dust distribution around three agb stars : w  aql , and the detached shell sources dr  ser , and u  cam .  w  aql is a binary and we find indications of a bi - polar dust distribution around the star .  the observations of the latter two sources clearly reveal the detached shells , likely the result of a brief , strongly enhanced mass - loss rate during the late evolution of these stars .  mapping the detached shells gives us clues to the symmetry of the mass loss and important evolutionary processes .\n"
