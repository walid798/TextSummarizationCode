Today\u2019s answer for: How do you stay motivated at work? is written by Juliet de Baubigny, partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\n\nPush the boundaries: join a board. I strongly recommend that all professionals get involved with work outside of their day job and, when they can, join a board \u2013 the right board \u2013 as a way to keep highly motivated at work.\n\nA few years into my career at KPCB\u2013just when I was starting to really hit my stride (and probably my comfort zone)\u2013my KP partner John Doerr came to me with a completely out-of-the-box request: Would I be willing to speak with Bono and Bobby Shriver about the \u201cProduct RED\u201d initiative they recently launched in the U.K.? That conversation began a nine-year journey, first as an advisor and then as a board member working to shape an organization that has now contributed more than $300 million to The Global Fund to provide antiretroviral drugs to women and children in sub-saharan Africa.\n\nJoining a board also shaped me as a professional in more ways than I could imagine. It tested first-hand everything that I was advising our entrepreneurs to do as they built their companies: achieve the impossible on a limited budget, hire the best (one of the best hires I have ever made was bringing in Deborah Dugan to run RED), navigate choppy regulatory waters, reshape the business model against a changing economy, and develop long-term partners. At the same time, I had the privilege of watching a team and board come together to do something truly impactful: get medicine to those who need it and, ultimately, save lives.\n\nThis \u201cnight job\u201d taught me passion, tested my skills, and pushed me to grow\u2013all skills from which KPCB was able to benefit tremendously. Joining a board (profit or not for profit) develops all the skills above, plus time management in order not to detract from your day job. It has been an incredible learning experience and has truly inspired me.\n\nRead all answers to the MPW Insider question: How do you stay motivated at work?\n\n5 secrets to stay motivated at work by Sarah Robb O\u2019Hagan, president of Equinox.",

        "text": "If you consider flying one of life\u2019s miseries, you might be flying the wrong airline.\n\nA new survey suggests that air travel is slowly improving, led by a small group of airlines.\n\nPassengers who fly JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines had the highest satisfaction rating \u2014 800 and 781, respectively, out of a possible score of 1000, according to J.D. Power\u2019s latest North America Airline Satisfaction study.\n\nOverall passenger satisfaction with major airlines increased to 717 out of a possible score of 1000 in 2015, up from 712 a year ago, according to J.D. Power\u2019s study.\n\nHere are some of the major findings:\n\nThe study gauged passenger satisfaction among both business and leisure passengers in several key areas, including costs, fees, in-flight services, onboard experience and reservations. It was conducted between April 2014 and March 2015. J.D. Power distinguishes between \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201clow-cost\u201d carriers in its ranking, but Fortune combined them for this report.\n\nThe findings reflect another recent study on airline service, which also suggested airline service was trending higher.\n\nTo put these scores into a little perspective, the top-ranked airline would receive an equivalent letter grade of \u201cB-.\u201d The highest-scoring legacy carrier, Delta Air Lines, would get a \u201cC-.\u201d The lowest-ranked carriers receive a grade of \u201cD,\u201d according to its customers.\n\nAirlines still rank below banks and mortgage lenders, two other industries covered by J.D. Power. \u201cAirline customer service experience is low,\u201d says Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nWhat the findings mean for customers\n\nJ.D. Power says the findings show that customer service matters, perhaps now more than ever. In its view, the airline industry is evolving from a commoditized transportation business into a business focused on hospitality and services.\n\n\u201cThe carriers most focused on providing a pleasant experience are being rewarded with higher customer satisfaction and loyalty,\u201d says Garlick.\n\nHe says the study suggests that when passengers make the decision to fly an airline based on the services or experience the airline provides, rather than price, convenient routes and scheduling, satisfaction is higher and passengers are more likely to return to the airline brand and to recommend it to others.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason for the uptick in scores, and they have nothing to do with better service.\n\n\u201cPeople have adapted to the airline fees that use to upset them,\u201d adds Garlick. \u201cSo it might be more accurate to say people are less dissatisfied.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the J.D. Power numbers shows how various airlines succeeded \u2014 and failed.\n\nAmerican and Delta surged ahead by investing in their customer service infrastructure and training, with an emphasis on high-revenue business travelers. Alaska\u2019s downward swing can be explained by some of its growing pains, as it expands to new cities where passengers are less familiar with the brand. And the failure of airlines such as United and Frontier? Garlick says those airlines have focused on low fares and high fees, to the detriment of customer service.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants low-cost travel,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s a price to be paid for it. The low-ranked carriers are running their companies so frugally that not even their core customers are satisfied. They\u2019re willing to pay for a better experience.\u201d\n\nA long way to go\n\nCritics agree that airline service still has a way to go before it can be considered good. \u201cAs the airlines have been complaining that customers are treating their seats like commodities, the airlines themselves are treating their passengers \u2014 except frequent flier elites and first class \u2014 like self-loading cargo,\u201d says Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy organization for air travelers. \u201cOnboard services have been ratcheted back, extra and exorbitant fees are being loaded on passengers, and legroom and seat sizes continue to shrink.\u201d\n\nLeocha says investing in customer service doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. A simple smile from flight attendants or gate agents, waiving a standby fee to get on an earlier flight with empty seats, allowing families to sit together without paying more, all make the travel experience far more pleasant.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he adds, \u201cthese amenities still seem to be in short supply.\u201d",

According to data by Jefferies, the outstanding shares held by short sellers on Noble Group increased from 50 million shares in April to around 400 million now.\n\n\"[Despite the third buyback,] we continue to see the possibility of a dead cat bounce in Noble's shares. Near-term oscillators continue to point to the bearish side, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) still capped below 50 and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) line remaining under the signal and zero line,\" IG's market strategist Bernard Aw wrote in a note released Tuesday, adding that the 50-day moving average at S$0.828 will act as a \"formidable barrier\" for the stock.\n\nA dead cat bounce is a short-lived rally, often caused by short-covering, in a stock suffering from a prolonged decline.\n\nMost importantly, Aw said that weak underlying fundamentals remained the key obstacles for a recovery in the battered stock.\n\n\"The reality is that Noble is under pressure from several fronts, including a falling profit margin, a slowdown in commodity trading as well as issues relating to corporate governance and transparency. Piecemeal measures such as share buybacks are unlikely to relieve the downward pressure as long as the backdrop does not improve substantially,\" Aw said.\n\nFor CMC Markets' Nicholas Teo, the sustainability of the rebound depends on how aggressive Noble Group is with their share purchases.\n\n\"The rebound is relative on how much more the company wants to buy since they have in their authority to buy up to 673 million shares based on their filing. The shares they have bought thus far, with no pun intended, is only the tip of the iceberg,\" the Singapore-based analyst told CNBC by phone. Noble Group now holds more than 62 million shares by way of market acquisition.\n\n\"The aggressive buying has shown a floor in the share price and markets recognize that, regardless of whether the rebound is sustainable or not, so short sellers may not be so keen now. But the rebound above S$0.70 may also allow short sellers to have the opportunity to have another kick in the can,\" Teo added.\n\nShares of Noble Group have lost about 40 percent since February when anonymous group Iceberg Research released a series of critical reports on the Hong Kong trader's accounting practices. U.S. short seller Muddy Waters dealt another blow to the company in April after saying it had taken a short position on the stock.\n\nLast week, S&P downgraded the company's rating outlook to negative from stable, citing that the higher risk nature of Noble's trading positions could result in more volatile earnings and profitability for the company.",

        "text": "Stock markets are falling fast. After a dismal performance last week, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is struggling to climb back from a sharp early Monday drop, while markets all around the world have endured big losses.\n\nWhat\u2019s shaking investor confidence? In a word, China, where weak economic numbers and some increasingly desperate interventions by the state have awakened investors to the possibility of a painful slowdown.\n\nAdd in concerns about how malaise in China could hurt other developing countries, plus fears that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has lost its patience for necessary stimulus, and you have all the ingredients for a global sell-off.\n\nFor decades now, economic growth in China has been fiery, often reaching rates above 10 percent.\n\nBut those heady days of consistent, high-octane growth seem to be over. In the first half of 2015, China\u2019s growth rate was 7 percent, and that\u2019s if you believe the official numbers (for comparison, a recent independent analysis found that the true unemployment rate in China may be nearly three times the official rate).\n\nThe slump is part of a global wave of selling triggered by increased signs of an economic slowdown in China.\n\nFears were stoked earlier this month when China removed some of the limits on currency trading and the value of the yuan fell substantially. Even though the Chinese government was probably hoping for the yuan to lose some value, investors interpreted the drop as a sign of weakness.\n\nThat\u2019s because China was supposed to be moving past the export-first phase of its development \u2014 no longer just a place for companies to make cheap products, but a mature consumer market where companies from around the world can sell their goods to the growing Chinese middle class.\n\nAlso disconcerting was the way the Chinese government handled its July stock market collapse, where it intervened aggressively to prop up stock prices, suggesting that it isn\u2019t ready to let markets operate on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to exaggerate the connection between market fluctuations and events around the world. There\u2019s a lot of unpredictability in market movements, and it\u2019s often impossible to tease out the deeper forces driving markets.\n\nBut here\u2019s how the slowdown in China might be feeding the current troubles.\n\nThe most basic reason stock prices fall is because investors start to think \u2014 or fear \u2014 that companies are going to perform worse than previously anticipated. And if China is facing a severe economic slowdown \u2014 one that could hamper the development of a robust Chinese consumer class \u2014 some companies would indeed have a smaller market for their goods. That means lower profits, less money to share with investors, and lower stock prices.\n\nChina is far from the only thing weighing down markets. Other concerns include:\n\n\u25a0 Contagion: If China\u2019s economy really is slowing, lots of other countries will suffer alongside. As an example, a slowing China would probably need less oil, driving down oil prices and hurting oil-dependent economies like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u25a0 Rising interest rates: For months the Federal Reserve has been preparing investors for a hike in interest rates. But the point of raising rates is to keep the US economy from overheating. And with China\u2019s slowdown threatening the US economy, the big challenge may be to heat the economy back up, not cool it down.\n\n\u25a0 An overdue correction: The stock market has been outperforming the US economy ever since the Great Recession. There\u2019s some good reason for that, including the fact that corporate profits have been particularly strong. But the market can only run so far ahead of the real economy before some kind of correction sets in. And that may be what we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nSometimes a sharp downturn in the markets is followed by an equally sharp recovery. Other times, there\u2019s no such rapid rebound. After the black Monday sell-off in 1987, it took more than a year for the S&P 500 to recoup its losses. After the tech bubble burst in 2000, it took about six years.\n\nOne hopeful precedent is the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which swept through much of southeast Asia and initially sent the US stock market tumbling. Within a few months, all those losses had been recouped.\n\nThen again, in 1997 China was largely insulated from Asia\u2019s economic troubles. That\u2019s not true this time around, and it could mean a wider fallout, a slower recovery, and possibly some spillover from a stock market crisis into a full-on economic downturn.",

And, with house building falling to an 87-year low, just three housing schemes were granted awards.\n\nMany of the country's leading designers, including Zaha Hadid, David Chipperfield and Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, won accolades for buildings elsewhere in the EU rather than at home. Hadid's expressionist angles and curves were reserved for Rome's museum of 21st-century art, MAXXI, while Lord Rogers, widely regarded as one of the world's leading modernists, designed a new headquarters campus for a Spanish technology company in Seville.\n\n\"The RIBA awards reflect not only the state of British architecture but also that of its economy,\" said Ruth Reed, the institute's president. \"In the midst of the deepest recession in the awards' 45-year history, this year demonstrates that, although times might be hard for architects, there are still great buildings being built throughout the country and overseas. The RIBA awards always give an opportunity for gem-like small projects and less established practices to shine through, and this year is no exception. Far from being a size prize, the RIBA awards are for buildings that offer value to people's lives.\"\n\nThe memorial in Hyde Park to the victims of the 7 July 2005 bomb attacks on the London transport network, by Carmody Groarke, also won and is considered by some as a possible contender for the shortlist for the \u00a320,000 Stirling prize for building of the year, which is drawn from the RIBA award winners.\n\nEllis Woodman, architecture critic at the newspaper Building Design, said that other strong Stirling prize contenders included the Nottingham contemporary arts centre, the new British embassy in Warsaw, the Neues Museum in Berlin, Christ's College school in Guildford and Hadid's MAXXI museum.\n\nThe Oregon-born architect Rick Mather won most awards, gaining four. Other winning buildings included a new home in Bristol for Wallace and Gromit's creators, Aardman Animations, and a cluster of foil-clad small-business units, which look like cybermen helmets, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, in Wales.",

Martin Clayton, curator of the exhibition \u2013 which will open in the Queen's Gallery at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh to coincide with the Edinburgh festival, and run on until mid-November \u2013 believes his work on anatomy could have transformed medical knowledge, but the results remained in his own notebooks until his death in 1519. He had intended to publish a major treatise but, like so much of his work, it was never completed as he was constantly distracted by new projects.\n\nAll the drawings had been imported into England by the 17th century, bound into an album which was probably bought by Charles II, and have been in the Royal Collection since at least 1690.\n\nSome of the anatomical drawings were exhibited in the Queen's Gallery in London last year, but the Edinburgh show will be the first to compare Leonardo's results with scalpel and pen with the best results of modern technology.\n\nClayton said: \"For the first time we will be displaying the artist's works alongside stunning examples of medical imaging, showing how the concerns and methods of the world's leading anatomists have changed little in 500 years, and how truly groundbreaking Leonardo's work was.\n\nThe exhibition will show how close Leonardo got in some of his last medical experiments to discovering the role of the beating heart in the circulation of the blood, a century before William Harvey worked it out.\n\nIn 1508 he dissected a 100-year-old man, and recorded accurately for the first time cirrhosis of the liver, and narrowing of the arteries. In the winter of 1510-11 he worked with the professor of anatomy dissecting 20 corpses in the medical school of Pavia, and covered his sheets of paper with multi-layered drawings from different angles of almost every bone in the human body including the first accurate depiction of the spine, and many of the major muscle groups.\n\nOne of the more famous drawings in the collection, of a baby in the womb \u2013 partly based on his dissection of a pregnant cow \u2013 will be displayed beside a 3D ultrasound scan of a foetus.\n\nHis drawings of a hand, beginning with the bones, adding the deep muscles of the palm and then the layers of tendons, will be displayed beside a film of a dissected hand in high definition 3D.

        "text": "On the living room mantelpiece of Yinka Shonibare's house in east London sits another house. It is a scale, doll-sized model, although the d\u00e9cor - diminutive dining table and chairs, four-poster bed, and a framed print of an old master painting \u2013 differs from the real version, which Shonibare has filled with works by fellow artists. A painted sign by Bob and Roberta Smith hangs on one wall, alongside a work by Hew Locke \u2013 a sinister, floor-length photograph of what looks like a south-east Asian tribesman wielding an array of knives.\n\nShonibare has more in common with Locke than simply owning his work. Both artists are previous recipients of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation award for visual arts. The awards carry big money \u2013 currently \u00a345,000, spread over three years \u2013 significant enough to change the lives of its recipients. Yet, compared with higher-profile, headline-grabbing prizes such as the Turner (this year's winners of which will be announced a week today), the Paul Hamlyn - named after the late publisher and philanthropist - is barely ever talked about outside the art world.\n\nThe awards were originally set up in 1994 to provide composers with enough cash to allow them to concentrate on developing their ideas over a three-year period. They were expanded in 1998 \u2013 the year Shonibare was a winner \u2013 to include those working in the visual arts. Since then, they have been awarded to some of the best-known artists around today, from Shonibare and Locke to Jeremy Deller, Gustav Metzger, Mike Nelson and Tomma Abts. The Turner, for which Shonibare was himself nominated in 2004, may exceed the Paul Hamlyn in terms of sheer, brassy glamour, but those who have benefited from the Paul Hamlyn are almost evangelical about its value to their career and confidence.\n\nIn 1998, Shonibare was working three days a week as a development officer for the disability arts organisation, Shape; the rest of his time was devoted to delivering a rapidly increasing number of commissions, and demands for shows. He felt, he says, \"that it was a sort of catch-22 thing. If you still have a part-time job you can't really throw yourself in fully. While I liked the job, my art career was also building. So it was really hard - like pulling myself between the two things.\"\n\nWhen he won the award, however, Shonibare was able to resign and concentrate on his art full-time. It was in the very fact of being able to stop worrying about money that, somewhat ironically, he began to make some. \"Not only did the award give me confidence,\" he says, \"it just took away the worry of money, because that can be very distracting. And actually, being able to switch to the [art] work then subsequently produced more money.\"\n\nPerformance artist Rose English, who won a Paul Hamlyn award the year after Shonibare, agrees. Her multidisciplinary work is difficult to quantify, which meant she had, she says, been finding it very difficult to secure funding \u2013 especially to work on ideas. Public funding tends to require the applicant to create a particular, tangible project (such as a stage show or exhibition), while an award such as the Turner retrospectively recognises a successful show or body of work; the aim of the Paul Hamlyn is to give the artist the breathing space to develop fresh ideas. \"The fact that there were no strings attached was very valuable,\" English says. \"There was no specific play or performance to get together.\"\n\nEnglish did, nonetheless, use the three years financed by the award both to stage a musical performance, Standing Room Only, in London (she had been planning it for years, but had not yet secured funding); and to research a longer-term project. Called Lost in Music, it's a performance piece using acrobatics, singing, fire, and, intriguingly, glass, and it will be produced and performed next year in China. \"I was able to just batten down the hatches,\" English says of those three years, \"and get on with it.\"\n\nEnglish also found her confidence boosted by the knowledge that other artists had been involved in making the decision, rather than the distant, grey-suited bureaucrats more readily associated with public funding. This year among the art world luminaries who helped to choose the shortlist were artist Rachel Whiteread, Serpentine director Hans Ulrich Oberst, and Whitechapel Gallery curator Anthony Spira. The winners are then chosen by a smaller team of judges (this year, the Guardian's Adrian Searle; Paul Hamlyn's daughter, gallery owner and chair of the foundation Jane Hamlyn; and Baltic director Godfrey Worsdale).\n\nTo win, therefore, is to gain a vote of confidence from the people whose opinion matters most \u2013 curators, gallerists and, most importantly, other artists. \"To know that these people whose opinion I valued had actually chosen me,\" English says, \"made me feel such a connection with them.\" Shonibare goes even further: \"Paul Hamlyn has something that the Turner doesn't have \u2026 It has peer respect.\"\n\nWhere Hamlyn also differs from the Turner is in age criteria: the Turner is only open to artists under the age of 50, but artists of any age are eligible for the Paul Hamlyn. Gustav Metzger was 80 when he won the award in 2006; the film-maker and photographer Horace Ov\u00e9 was 69. The Trinidadian-born Ov\u00e9 is using his award to transfer his career-long archive of works between the Caribbean and the UK, and to focus on his photography (planned projects include a trip to Congo). \"Winning the Paul Hamlyn has been very, very helpful to me,\" he says.\n\nFor Shonibare, there is nonetheless a tangible correlation, at least among the younger artists, between Paul Hamlyn winners and Turner prize nominees. \"If you look up all the artists who've been nominated for the Turner in the last 10 years,\" he says, \"you will find that prior to the Turner nomination, a lot of them actually received the Paul Hamlyn.\" So did Shonibare actually find winning the Paul Hamlyn as significant as being nominated for the Turner? \"They're two very different things,\" he says tactfully. \"Paul Hamlyn is very low-key; it's very discreet, publicity-wise. You have to have really thick skin when you do the Turner, because people will just hurl abuse at you from every corner. Even cab drivers have an opinion. You wouldn't get into a cab and find the driver discussing the Paul Hamlyn.\"\n\nAlthough Shonibare won the popular vote at the time of his nomination (64% of visitors to the BBC website said they wanted him to win), he says he still suffered his fair share of abuse. \"The Turner is great,\" he says, \"but it has all other kinds of agendas attached to it. It's more about popular culture, more about the media opportunity to dislike contemporary art. The press love to rubbish art - with the Turner they do it every year. The Paul Hamlyn doesn't get into any of that. It's a serious award. It's not being dragged into the gutter.\"\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday November 25 2008.

        "text": "Manet was the last French painter to love black for a very long time. The museum habit of placing him among the Impressionists has a curious effect. In New York's Metropolitan Museum, stepping from the interminable Renoir rooms into the Manet room produces a shock; stepping back produces another one, not quite in reverse. Renoir, who believed and said that black did not exist, that all shadows had a colour, apparently succeeded a painter who loved the knife-edge contrasts of black. The intense matadors of Manet give way to the smiling pastel matrons of Renoir; dramatic costumes, as if for a stage performance or a last appearance in the arena, are succeeded by a natural sincerity. Black disappeared after Manet, not to reappear until Matisse. Pleasingly, the aged Renoir lived to be deeply shocked by the black horizontal bar in Matisse's Int\u00e9rieur \u00e0 Nice, now in Philadelphia.\n\nVisitors to the Royal Academy's new blockbuster Manet exhibition will be immediately struck by the glowering, Spanish-flavoured black, which separates him so strongly from the next generation. But on the other hand, there are aspects of Manet's painterly practice that root him powerfully in his own time, and strongly influenced the generations that followed \u2013 not just in painting. The age was one that was fascinated by what Gerard Manley Hopkins was to call \"dappled things\" \u2013 the effect of coupled light and dark in flecks and movement under trees and in urban shade. \"All things counter, original, spare, strange; whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?) with swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim\"; Hopkins' catalogue starts to surface elsewhere, in Manet's first mature paintings, and maintains a powerful presence in the art, music and above all painting of the rest of the century.\n\nDapplement surfaces in the great Musique dans les Jardins des Tuileries of 1862, somehow both epic and domestic in scale, and is the thing that saves it from direct comparison with the social panoramas of William Powell Frith, across the Channel. An all-enveloping rippling light turns it into a study of atmosphere. Dapplement, with its unpredictable emphases and shadows, its world of half-glimpses and dramatic clarity, determines what meaning Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe might possess. Dapplement had occasionally interested earlier painters, and Le Linge of 1875 pays some homage to the great series of laundress paintings of Fragonard, a century before, where the figures are almost lost in bursts of light falling on steam.\n\nA subsequent generation, including Renoir in the Bal du Moulin de la Galette, which recapitulates Musique dans les Jardins des Tuileries, used dapplement to create a rippling uniformity in a diverse scene. Manet's fascination was rather different. It is used to demonstrate the unpredictable object, the startling contrast, the grotesque event with the unexpected fall of direct light amid shade. It combines the detailed passage with a grand sweep of crepuscular shade, the closely observed with the mysteriously vague. Dapplement was a tool for him, like the sudden emergence of a social group into the light from deep shade, like the curious group in Le Balcon at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, or the great Dejeuner dans l'Atelier in Munich. It froze a moment in all its curious combinations, as photography was one day to do. Dapplement in Manet is much more like the dappled observations of his friend Chabrier's piano piece \"Sous-bois\" \u2013 a work so strange I remember repeatedly stopping while learning it as a boy, unable to believe that a composer of the 1870s could intend these sounds. Manet's late Un Bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re hung over Chabrier's piano; it is nice to think of the mercurial musician looking up as he played. Manet's dapplement resembles the gorgeous and unpredictable shifts between soloist, septet, chorus and orchestra, between foreground and sweeping backdrop, which Berlioz found for the end of the fourth act of Les Troyens in the late 1850s. It resembles, too, the bizarre juxtapositions in Madame Bovary, such as the declarations of love against the cries of an agricultural auction, and, much later, the freakish shifts of direction in the poetry of Manet's friend Mallarm\u00e9 \u2013 his early \"L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune\", like the Debussy orchestral prelude, is an ode to dappled light and the bizarre, erotic contrasts it produces.\n\nManet's art is devoted to the wrong thing in the wrong place, unpredictably caught out and spotlit by the fall of light or the pitiless gaze. Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe, with its outrageous combination of clothed male figures and nude, or deshabill\u00e9 women, was defended by Zola on the grounds of classical precedent. (Not quite as much as Zola claims, however.) There are Giorgione landscapes and Titian interiors that exploit the same contrast. But Manet's point is the indecency of the contrast in a contemporary context \u2013 the very fashionable little tassled cap on the head of one of the men is the most obscene thing in the painting. Similarly, in the sumptuous Olympia, what turns the nude into a shocking study of a prostitute? It is the clothes \u2013 the clothes the maid wears, the orchid in the hair, the black ribbon about the neck, the pearl earrings and the bracelet, and above all, the slippers \u2013 that transform the nude. There are franker 19th-century studies of the female form, such as Courbet's Origine du Monde, but none so ingeniously obscene.\n\nDressing up is the source of much joy and bizarre contrast in Manet. Go back to the incomparable Manet room in the Metropolitan, and look around. The beautiful Mlle V en Costume d'Espada has the face of a handsome boy, and would pass as a matador but for one thing \u2013 the painter's voluptuous enjoyment of her unmistakably feminine bottom and swelling belly. Next to that, an absurdly upright 1866 matador with showy, excessive sideburns seems to be dressing up as a man, too, as does the little boy with a serious expression carrying a sword that is far too big for him. And then the limp Christ with the angels, their expressions not sweet and generalised, but very much studies of hard-faced Parisian women, perhaps women whose trade is the laying out of corpses \u2013 what to make of that? Was Manet quite serious?\n\nManet retained a detached relationship to the subject matter of paintings that challenged even the most sympathetically inclined of his contemporaries. Gautier was alarmed by the combination of realism and topic in Le Christ Mort et les Anges. Zola, in the course of his spirited defence of Manet, was not quite right to say:\"Feeling that he was making no progress by copying the masters, or by painting Nature as seen through the eyes of individuals who differed in character from himself,\" Manet \"came to understand, quite naturally, one fine day, that it only remained to him to see Nature as it really is, without looking at the works or studying the opinions of others.\" The detachment from artistic tradition comes not through complete freedom, but from a willingness to examine and break the rules of presentation. This urge has, it turns out, resulted in a series of cunning traps laid for the oversophisticated. There is a large body of critical work about Manet's last major painting, Un Bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re, either decrying its impossible depiction of a reflection, or talking about the subtle fantasy that results from this impossibility. It took until 2001, and the reconstruction of the image by an Australian art historian, Malcolm Park, before the scene was shown to be perfectly plausible. Manet had just taken the greatest care to make the scene look as impossible, and indeed ineptly constructed, as he knew how.\n\nPortraiture, which is the focus of the Royal Academy's show, had become still more hidebound by the advent and influence of photography. As one of the great early photographers, Nadar, remarked in his autobiography, the advent of the carte de visite type of photographic portrait \"spelled disaster. Either you had to succumb \u2013 that is, follow the trend \u2013 or resign.\" Carol M Armstrong reminds us in the RA catalogue that Manet's friend Baudelaire had been similarly scathing about photography's impact on society in his Salon of 1859, speaking of the moment when \"our squalid society rushed, Narcissus to a man, to gaze at its trivial image on a scrap of metal\".\n\nManet's portraiture is devoted to the image that is controlled not by the conventions of the form, still less of the acceptable conventions of emerging photography portraiture, but by the gaze of the artist. If some of the portraits, such as the famous one of Zola, follow the conventional format established by Ingr\u00e8s, others, such as the portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 or La Dame aux Eventails in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, return to the fantasy portraits of Fragonard, and seem to draw inspiration from a blurred photographic print. Others revel in the momentary impression, even of a face glimpsed in the street in a dumpy, unconsidered posture in mid-movement, as if thinking that painting could achieve through imaginative action what photography, as yet, was not technically capable of. In the portrait Berthe Morisot au Bouquet de Violettes she is caught between poses, slowly moving into an amused smile. There are curious urban scenes to make Diane Arbus wonder; the grouping of the balcony, or the marvellously awkward and grumpy mother and daughter against the strangest of geometric backdrops in Le Chemin de Fer, now in Washington DC. These are moments that might have been glimpsed in the street, from the window of a moving hansom cab, by a device not yet perfected. Or alternatively, by an unresting and ceaselessly inventive eye, with a perfect visual memory, apparently in need of little mechanical help. It is difficult to tell.\n\nZola was quite right to base his defence of Manet on the painter's perfect eye. It was an eye of great purity, and one that came to an ironic and undermining position after the long years of argumentative apprenticeship in the studio of Manet's master, the salon painter Thomas Couture. (The scholar Beatrice Farwell remarks, surprisingly, that Manet was \"the last great French painter to receive a long and academic training\".) What the eye saw, however, was not completely unprejudiced. It was the observation of the visual moments that would most offend, most alarm, most bewilder; a face in a street, a line of railings and a suggestion of rising steam, a momentary pattern of dappled light that reveals, of all things, a naked woman sitting with two well-off young men in a forest glade, turning and smiling. What do these things mean? The startled eye closes; turns away; turns to something else, with amusement, but no certain claim to be making any kind of statement about anything but the fall of light.",

Manet's work was often criticized for being too radical and incomprehensible, but his friend and fellow artist, Edouard Manet, defended him, arguing that his paintings were not meant to be realistic or representational, but rather to capture the fleeting impressions of modern life. The article also mentions how Manet's style influenced later artists, such as Renoir and Mallarm\u00e9, and how his use of dappled light and unexpected contrasts was a precursor to the Impressionist movement.",

        "text": "History has been overly kind to \u201cFull House.\u201d Though it\u2019s now seen \u2014 through the obfuscating fog of nostalgia \u2014 as a classic family sitcom, the show was also archetypally average, hiding behind a ubiquitous laugh track and obnoxiously on-the-nose life lessons. It may well have been a television touchstone, but it was also the equivalent of a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup: fluffy, insubstantial, and so sickly sweet it could induce toothaches.\n\nSo when it was announced that Netflix planned to brush away the cobwebs for a new series dubbed \u201cFuller House,\u201d one question immediately arose: Why? Why this sitcom? Why does the original, which ran from 1987 to 1995, warrant a second serving, especially in a TV landscape already populated by series like \u201cModern Family,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d all of which mark smarter, more inclusive evolutions of the \u201cFull House\u201d formula?\n\nWell, as it turns out, the answer\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t, at all. In the six episodes sent to critics, \u201cFuller House\u201d suggests a raison d\u2019\u00eatre that amounts to little more than fan service of the most bare-faced, blaring variety.\n\nAs the pilot, by far the worst installment, teases out one familiar face after another (minus the Olsen twins, who get a fourth-wall-breaking admonishment for sitting this one out), an excess of communal back-patting takes center stage. \u201cDamn, we all still look good,\u201d Uncle Jesse (John Stamos, who admittedly does still look very good) even says at one point.\n\nBut like most of the shout-outs in \u201cFuller House,\u201d that line feels like less of a triumphant, meta declaration and more of a plea for fan validation. Jesse shouldn\u2019t sound so desperate. The live studio audience, of course, is ready with a hero\u2019s welcome, not just for Stamos but also Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, and Scott Weinger.\n\nHowever, the joy that hardcore fans will find in seeing this crew reassembled mostly intact is short-lived. At premiere\u2019s end, most of them hit the road, destined to flit back for occasional cameos, and the gender-flipped conceit of this new take becomes apparent: a widowed D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Cameron Bure) winds up installed in the San Francisco house, alongside sister Stephanie (Sweetin) and pal Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber), both of whom agree to help her raise a trio of young boys.\n\nThere will be three schools of thought around how \u201cFuller House\u201d riffs on the original\u2019s premise. Some may praise the absence of a domineering patriarch, seeing the freshly forged Tanner-Fuller-Gibbler triumvirate as a commendably feminist foundation. Others will likely fault the series for how it regressively encourages its three female leads to answer the call of motherhood and ditch any professional or personal ventures that could get in the way. And others still (the ones Netflix is really catering to) won\u2019t care to consider either thematic implication, instead relishing every stock plot, speech, and group hug the show has to offer, just as one relishes comfort food on a lazy Sunday morning.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub \u2014 with \u201cFuller House,\u201d Netflix has created its first critic-proof series. It\u2019s easy to wish everyone involved with this revival had been concerned with something more honorable than narcissistic self-celebration. Furthermore, in 2016, it\u2019s fair enough to look upon trite laughs, cloyingly sentimental touches, and cutesy diversions (a baby here, a puppy there) with some degree of distaste. If \u201cFull House\u201d had aired this year, it \u2014 like its sequel \u2014 would pale in comparison to practically everything else on offer. As such, most sitcom aficionados will find they\u2019ve outgrown the Tanner clan.\n\nNetflix knows it only has to please the ones who haven\u2019t, for whom seeing this mix of new and old characters run through the motions will feel like going back to the glory days of the sitcom itself. Bashing those folks is futile \u2014 let them enjoy this hollow exercise in nostalgia. But for the rest of us, \u201cFuller House\u201d never justifies its own existence, let alone why the uninitiated should give it a chance.",

        "text": "In recent weeks, \u201cGirls\u201d has put two central characters in a difficult spot \u2014 the classic \u201cill-fated love\u201d spot. Jessa and Adam, the show\u2019s two towering infernos, are enormously attracted to each other. But Jessa really doesn\u2019t want to hurt the prickly Hannah, her best friend and Adam\u2019s ex. Adam keeps aggressively courting Jessa, but she keeps fighting his efforts, trying to alter her lifelong pattern of unscrupulous, impulsive choices.\n\nActually, \u201cGirls\u201d is putting viewers in a difficult spot. too. It\u2019s obvious that Jessa and Adam, both looming physical presences, could make a great couple. They seem to belong together, in that somewhat indescribable but natural way, unlike Hannah and Adam, who never appreciated each other and were forever parsing misunderstandings. We\u2019ve watched the Jessa-Adam chemistry grow, as they\u2019ve toyed with friendship born of mutual sobriety. We\u2019ve seen that even the actors who play Adam and Jessa, Adam Driver and Jemima Kirke, click organically. But we know about the Ex Code \u2014 that you don\u2019t date your friends\u2019 past loves \u2014 and Hannah and her inevitably dramatic feelings of betrayal hang over all of us.\n\nOn many shows, this kind of three-way crash is something of a time killer. The lead guy and gal are clearly going to get there, with their wedding serving as one of the season finales, or even as the series finale. They are the show\u2019s fated pair, and that is the subtext of everything they do. But the writers need to find obstacles in the meantime, to fuel seasons of episodes. So they bring in a third player. On \u201cFriends,\u201d we knew all along that Ross and Rachel would wind up together, that they were \u201cmeant to be.\u201d But nonetheless we had to go through a ridiculous dating period between Joey and Rachel, as if. \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d played the same game, steering Robin into Barney\u2019s arms \u2014 even marrying them \u2014 while all along we felt in our heart of hearts that she\u2019d wind up with Ted, which she did.\n\nSometimes, though, writers fool with the fated-couple expectation, that often wearying clich\u00e9, and it can work perfectly. The best example I can think of was on \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d At the start of the series, viewers could easily assume that sensitive boy Dawson would end up with his childhood pal Joey. But as the series developed, it became clear that the endearing innocence of their early bond made them soulmates, but not lovers, and that Joey and Pacey were far more suited for each other romantically. In the end, Joey and Pacey were together, and it felt right.\n\nI certainly thought early in \u201cGirls\u201d that Hannah and Adam were destined to work out, that they\u2019d grow up and together, that he\u2019d be her Mr. Right and her Mr. Big. But the writers have shown the unbearable dysfunction of their relationship in such detail, it seems increasingly possible that Hannah and Adam aren\u2019t going to prevail. Is the Jessa and Adam story a detour, or is it a main thoroughfare to the end of the road, which will be next season? I love the thought that \u201cGirls\u201d would avoid the guaranteed-love formula, that it would follow through with its generally more realistic and honest approach to twentysomething romance in the 2010s.\n\nBy now you can probably tell that I am an Adam and Jessa shipper, that if I wrote fan fiction I would have them together and doing performance art on the streets forevermore. They could be Brooklyn\u2019s bushy, boho birds of a feather, mumblecore\u2019s own Gomez and Morticia Addams. It\u2019s so obvious they are cut from the same cloth; they\u2019re both moody, cryptic, and willfully unpredictable. Perhaps that means that, as Jessa said, a love affair would be a mess: \u201cYou know as well as I do, even if we could be together, even if Hannah didn\u2019t exist, that I would destroy you,\u201d she told him after they spent a carefree day together. \u201cAnd you would destroy me.\u201d I\u2019d definitely like to find out if that\u2019s true.",

(Ages 5 to 9)\n\nTHE STORY OF LITTLE BABAJI\n\nMichael di Capua Books/HarperCollins Publishers. $14.95.\n\nIn order to look at ''Sam and the Tigers'' and ''The Story of Little Babaji,'' many adults, and all of today's children, would be helped by a little bit of history. Madras in the summer of 1898 was no place for small girls of fair complexion -- especially since their father was busy investigating the causes of bubonic plague. Retreat to a villa in the hills was prudent, leaving Mother to divide her time between cool daughters and sweltering husband.\n\nTo keep the family's spirits up during her shuttle trips, Helen Bannerman turned to writing illustrated letters and telling homemade stories. Among the most successful of these was the tale of how Little Black Sambo bested a bunch of tigers who had tried to steal his clothes. She invented it on one of her train journeys down to Madras and made a little book out of it, which she illustrated and bound herself.\n\nIts success was not confined to the family, however. An English friend, due to return shortly to Britain, thought it ought to be published and volunteered to take the manuscript to London to negotiate a deal. Bannerman was not too keen on that, but with many injunctions against selling the copyright she let the little treasure go.\n\nAnd that was the last she saw of it, and almost the last direct connection she had with it. For her hapless friend fell in with the monocled publisher Grant Richards, and ''The Story of Little Black Sambo'' was spirited out of her grasp to be published in 1899 as the fourth volume in his Dumpy Books series. He bought the whole thing for just 5.\n\nHaving obtained the copyright, Richards then failed to protect it in the United States, and it wasn't long before the stateside predators moved in. The simple story, so well fitted for the dynamics of storytelling or the pages of a picture book, and costing nothing, was like a present, and ''Little Black Sambo'' soon began a trans-Atlantic career in magazines, in storybooks and in a host of unauthorized editions with rewritten texts and recast illustrations.\n\nOddly enough, the same thing was to happen a year or two later when Messrs. Frederick Warne forgot to copyright ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in the United States; but where Beatrix Potter's work was merely devitalized or vulgarized, ''Little Black Sambo'' had a harder time. Having begun life in India as an innocent companion to two homesick girls, it became, 60 years later, one of the principal miscreants accused of bringing racism into children's literature.\n\nAs far as Bannerman's hero was concerned, the main charges were his offensive name (along with that of Black Mumbo, his mother, and Black Jumbo, his father) and their cheerful but crude depiction in Bannerman's illustrations. Subsidiary charges related to a kind of illegal immigrant status, since the characters in the pictures appeared to be African while the setting, with its tigers and its ghee, was clearly Indian, and there was also trouble over Sambo's gross behavior in eating no fewer than 169 pancakes. Guilt by association was reflected back from the multiplicity of -- usually frightful -- unauthorized editions, and Sambo became a pariah.\n\nNow, however, as the boy approaches his 100th birthday, a rehabilitation begins. With great generosity of spirit, Julius Lester recognizes in his notes to ''Sam and the Tigers'' that Helen Bannerman's unpretentious tale ''transcended its stereotypes.'' ''What other story,'' he asks, ''had I read at the age of 7 and remembered for 50 years?'' Where lay the secret but in the story's ''truth of the imagination''?\n\nThus, with Jerry Pinkney, with whom he has also collaborated on versions of the Uncle Remus stories and a life of John Henry, Mr. Lester has fashioned a new telling, expanding the story and narrating it in a ''Southern black storytelling voice.'' Concurrently, Mr. Pinkney has converted the ''mythical quality'' of Bannerman's illustrations into pages filled with action.",

The German sports brand's proposed new shoes feature orange rubber shackles fixed to the back of the sneaker that can be attached around the ankle. The sneakers have since been dubbed the \"shackle shoes\" after rousing fury for its racist connotation.\n\nAdidas faced a furious backlash over its shackle shoes, or the JS Roundhouse Mids, from those who accused the brand of racism.\n\n\"The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive,\" wrote Reverend Jesse Jackson, for the Huffington Post. \"Removing the chains from our ankles and placing them on our shoes is no progress.\n\n\"For Adidas to promote the athleticism and contributions of a variety of African-American sports legends -- especially Olympic heroes Wilma Rudolph and Jesse Owens and boxing great Muhammad Ali -- and then allow such a degrading symbol of African-American history to pass through its corporate channels and move toward actual production and advertisement, is insensitive and corporately irresponsible.\"\n\nAlthough Adidas initially defended the designer of the shackle shoes, Jeremy Scott, as having a \"quirky\" and \"lighthearted\" vision, the company turned around and announced it would pull the sneakers from its line, according to CNN.\n\n\"The design of the JS Roundhouse Mid is nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery,\" the statement from Adidas said. \"We apologize if people are offended by the design and we are withdrawing our plans to make them available in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe photo still remains posted on Adidas' official Facebook page and, at the time of this posting, has more than 38,000 \"likes\" and almost 4,000 comments.\n\n\"I'm very glad Adidas has decided not to sell this shoe,\" commented one Facebook user. \"If you can't see how adding shackles to a pair of basketball sneakers is demeaning, you can't see much at all. Leaving that argument aside, these are not only butt ugly, but they were set to retail for THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. That's outrageous, given they have no function beyond making wearers look foolish.\"\n\n\"If any of you study the psychological effects of bondage in relation to any group of people or thing experiencing it under just or unjust conditions, studies show it's used to create fear, restrict and effect negatively the mental, physical and spiritual growth of the subject,\" commented another. \"But when man gets farther and farther away from true knowledge of self he begans [sic] to accept being treated like and animal and you can then sell him chains and bondage without resistane [sic].\"\n\n\"Forget the slavery angle for a moment -- why orange?\" asked another. \"Prison orange. Is prison an attractive concept now? 2/3 or more are filled with African American men. Is that the new cool... the new dope for un-incarcerated men, to emulate locked-up brothers by wearing symbols of their grief?\n\nOthers thought that the issue has been extremely overblown.\n\n\"Everyone equating these shoes with slavery are the true racists,\" wrote a Facebook user underneath the photo of Adidas' shackle shoes. \"They are the ones perpetuating stereotypes and are the reason this kind of talk is even an issue anymore. I hope Adidas reconsiders their decision to pull these from shelves and tells these offended people to go pound sand.\"\n\n\"People of all 'races' wear Adidas,\" commented another. \"Why do we have to jump to the conclusion that these are meant for a particular people group?\"\n\nAdidas is not the first sneaker brand to offend this year.\n\nNike announced plans to celebrate St. Patrick's Day 2012 with the release of the \"Nike SB Black and Tan Quickstrike\" to commemorate the Irish holiday. According to the Belfast Telegraph, Nike intended for \"Black and Tan\" to refer to the St. Patrick's Day drink made of a mix of stout and lager, usually Guinness and Harp. The sneaker was set to be released as part of a beer-inspired series, including the \"Nike SB Dunk High 'Guinness'\" colored black like the Ireland-brewed beer, ahead of St. Patrick's Day.\n\nHowever, \"Black and Tan\" was also the name of the British paramilitary unit who brutally attacked Irish citizens in the 1920s to quell revolutions against British rule, reported the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nThe Black and Tans, otherwise known simply as \"the Tans,\" killed and destroyed on a large scale, reported the Irish publication. \"When a Tan was killed in Cork, they burnt down more than 300 buildings,\" added the paper. The Catholic cardinal at one time referred to them as \"a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves.\"\n\nWhat do you think of the Adidas \"shackle shoes\" controversy -- is it rooted in racism or is it completely groundless?\n\nThePostGame brings you the most interesting sports stories on the web.\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter to read them first!",

Republicans call that number too high and extreme to be offering two weeks into negotiations with a just a month left before the deadline.\n\nIn exchange for the added tax revenue, Democrats would give in on $400 billion in spending cuts from entitlement programs like Medicare and an aide said those cuts would not be immediate.

While Congress could act to block a debt limit increase, it would not be necessary for Congress to approve one.\n\nOne Republican aide expressed outrage that the White House would ask for that with no reforms attached at all. Earlier today, Boehner said, that \"there is a lot of things that I have wanted in my life but almost all of them had a price tag attached to them.\n\n\"If we're going to talk about the debt limit in this, then there is going to be some price tag associated with it.\"\n\nDemocrats have been equally critical of Republicans in negotiations so far saying that Republicans have not put a real revenue offer on the table since they have not said how much money they'd be willing to put to the deficit through tax revenue.\n\n\"Right now, the only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates,\" Deputy White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a written statement.\n\n\"The President has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts and we remain willing to do tough things to compromise, and it's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices - from the business community to middle class Americans across the country - who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.\"\n\nDespite the appearance of talks breaking down today, Boehner said he's still optimistic a deal can be reached.\n\nThe White House's Nabors also seemed determined to keep talking.\n\n\"We're going to keep working with folks just like we have been and, you know, we'll make progress.\"",

        "text": "Is the hedge fund, as we know it, dead? Fifteen years ago, they were the hottest investments around. Every pension fund, endowment, and foundation clamored to get into this elite club, willing to pay hefty fees for the prospect of outsized returns.\n\nBut much has changed since the financial crisis. Except for the top hedge funds, most have shown disappointing performance since 2008, not even beating stock index returns. It seems the edge many had in outmaneuvering the markets has evaporated in more complex times. Red Sox owner John Henry is shutting down the commodities hedge fund shop that made him rich, the latest in a line of big names to retire. Others have been ensnared in a federal insider-trading inquiry that has tainted the industry, revealing a host of players who used unfair, and illegal, tactics to notch big gains.\n\nNow many large investors that favored hedge funds \u2014 from the Massachusetts state pension fund to Harvard University to small-town retirement funds like Plymouth\u2019s \u2014 are rethinking their approach to this once high-flying sector. They\u2019re looking less for the shoot-the-lights-out performance that hedge funds touted in the \u201990s, and more for traditional hedging and ways to reduce volatility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very crowded, and more and more difficult for them to show good performance,\u201d said Michael Trotsky, head of the $50 billion state pension fund and a former hedge fund manager himself. \u201cThe challenge becomes gaining access to only the very best, or you might as well go home.\u201d\n\nHedge funds are designed for institutions and the wealthy; they can invest in almost anything and usually take bigger risks than, say, a mutual fund meant for a typical investor with a 401(k) plan.\n\nTo be clear, hedge funds are still getting launched and money is still gushing into them; the sector recently notched a record $2.2 trillion in assets. But a majority of the new funds are shifting away from classic stock strategies and focusing instead on approaches such as interest rate bets and positions following the moves of the economy.\n\nOne reason for the shift: Far fewer hedge funds are producing big returns. And the gap between the best and the worst is enormous, suggesting that risks far outweigh the rewards when it comes to less-than-stellar funds. For the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, the top 10 percent of funds reported an average gain of 34 percent, while the bottom 10 percent saw an average 19 percent loss, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. of Chicago.\n\nSophisticated investors like the Massachusetts state pension fund and Harvard University are able to get access to the best hedge funds. But even they are looking more critically at these investments and considering alternatives.\n\nOne of Trotsky\u2019s first tasks running the state pension fund was explaining losses in two hedge funds raided by the FBI for alleged insider trading. These were relatively small holdings, worth $66 million. But the revelations laid bare a bigger issue: Three of the middleman firms the state used to gain access to hedge funds \u2014 called funds-of-funds \u2014 all had invested in one of the raided managers.\n\nSo much for spreading the risk. The state is now abandoning funds-of-funds,reasoning that they did not come up with original investment ideas or properly monitor their picks. Even with money divvied among more than 230 hedge funds, the state saw disappointing returns and high fees while becoming exposed to a number of investment scandals, including the Madoff scheme.\n\nThe state has 10 percent of its assets, or $5 billion, in hedge funds; Harvard has 15 percent, or about $4.7 billion. Both have increased their hedge fund allocations over time, although Harvard in the past year has backed off from 16 percent.\n\nThese and other institutional investors are also looking more critically at the firms they\u2019re willing to invest with and their costs. Many are abandoning funds-of-funds because of their lack of transparency and extra layer of fees.\n\nInvestors pay a fee of 1 percent to 2 percent upfront for access to most hedge funds, (plus another 1 percent or so in a fund-of-funds). After that, the hedge fund manager gets 20 percent of any gains they make on the investments, after certain hurdles. So, if you make $1 million, the hedge fund manager gets $200,000 of that.\n\nInvestors were willing to pay up when hedge funds generated fat profits for them during long bull markets. But in the volatile markets since 2008, many hedge funds have been unable to beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, or even the bond market.\n\nSome argue they\u2019re not supposed to \u2014 they\u2019re oriented so they don\u2019t correlate directly with the movements of stocks or bonds. But it\u2019s hard for many investors to justify the extra risk and enormous fees if they could do better in a simple index fund.\n\n\u201cWhen asset values are going up, regardless of strategy, people aren\u2019t focusing on fees as much as they should,\u2019\u2019 said David Scharfstein, a professor of finance and banking at Harvard Business School. If gains continue on a more modest track, he said, there will likely be more pressure on fees.\n\nAnother strike against hedge funds is the cash crunch they caused investors during the crisis. Institutions couldn\u2019t get their money out, because many hedge funds impose lockups, allowing money to be withdrawn only quarterly or less often. And in bad times, they can put up \u201cgates,\u201d barring withdrawals until markets calm down. In 2008 and 2009, many investors were suddenly faced with not only poor results, but a serious liquidity problem.\n\nThat led to a massive exodus from some funds once investors were able to get their hands on their money. Harvard has made a concerted effort to bring more assets in-house since 2008. The endowment\u2019s chief, Jane Mendillo, is a fan of \u201creal assets\u201d \u2014 including real estate, natural resources, and publicly traded commodities \u2014 which make up 25 percent of the portfolio, significantly more than hedge funds.\n\nGaining access to the best hedge funds matters more than ever. Dan Farley, senior managing director of State Street Global Advisors in Boston, said clients need to be clear on what they are looking for in a hedge fund, and realistic about whether they can get it.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get into the funds that meet your objectives and have top managers,\u201d Farley said, \u201cyou\u2019re probably better off looking to other alternatives.\u201d\n\nTrotsky is spending a lot of time on this issue, even teaching a class last year at the Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst where he assigned students to look for products that could model the risk/return profile of hedge funds at lower cost. He recently hired Eric Nierenberg, a Harvard-trained economist, to help analyze hedge funds, and to start thinking about alternative investments for the state. Trotsky has pledged a goal of saving the pension fund $100 million in fees in coming years, and a big part of that would come from hedge funds.\n\n\u201cWhat I want Eric to investigate is whether there are other techniques, or products, or ways to do it as effectively at a much reduced price,\u2019\u2019 Trotsky said.\n\nDozens of towns and cities around the Commonwealth are counting on Trotsky and the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board to deliver better returns from hedge funds, to help meet their retirement obligations. Thomas Kelley, chairman of Plymouth\u2019s retirement board, which oversees about $120 million, said he\u2019s keeping a close eye on the new approaches.\n\n\u201cI think it may be a change for the better,\u201d Kelley said, \u201cbut if it doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019ll take our money out.\u2019\u2019",

        "text": "Shall it be the Congolese goat stew or the Scottish red-legged partridge? The yam leaves in peanut paste with salted fish, or the wild rabbit terrine? We decide to go for a bit of everything. I'm having dinner with the artist Carsten H\u00f6ller in his latest project, the Double Club. This is a bar, restaurant and dance club where the Democratic Republic of Congo meets the west, and the west meets Congo. At least, that's the idea.\n\nThe club is up an alley beside Angel tube station in Islington, London, and we seem to be neither here nor there. I am confused. We drift between continents, choosing from two simultaneous menus. The most expensive dish on tonight's western menu is cote de boeuf, at \u00a342 for two, while the liboke na mbisi (conger eel in marantaceae leaves) is only \u00a311. The conger is very good, but my favourite is the goat.\n\nThis is not, H\u00f6ller says, some misplaced collision of world cuisines. \"There's no fusion here!\" he insists, and wants everything to be as authentic as possible. Nor has he suddenly decided to become a chef.\n\nThe restaurant - overseen by Mourad Mazouz, founder of London restaurants Momo and Sketch - is learning to cope; in another part of the club, a man in a boiler suit is still tinkering with the as-yet-unfinished dancefloor. Tomorrow, when the club opens, this will rotate, at one revolution per hour, turning between the Congolese and western sides of the club. The DJs will sit on the revolving platform, playing Congolese music or western dance, depending on which side of an invisible international divide they find themselves. So far, the only concession to Africa in the dance hall is a gaudy, kitsch plastic palm tree. The ceiling bristles with disco lighting equipment, which also rotates. But tonight it all feels far away.\n\nH\u00f6ller is best known in the UK for the slides he installed in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in 2006. They were enormously popular with the public, which deflected any doubts about their status as art - which, in any case, is an ever more complicated question. H\u00f6ller currently has a revolving hotel bedroom, where visitors can book a night between satin sheets, in the group show theanyspacewhatever, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. It's booked out for the entire duration of the exhibition, even though you must spend the night watched over by a museum guard.\n\nSponsored by the Fondazione Prada in Italy, the Double Club will stay open for the next six months. When H\u00f6ller suggested the idea, he was convinced Prada would turn it down. Not only did they say yes, they insisted on London as a venue. Now he's trying to encourage the Congolese community to come, as well as the regular club scene, plus the foodies, the art crowd, and an inquisitive public.\n\nWeek one, and the atmosphere hasn't quite kicked in yet. The cooking has yet to hit its stride, though the barbecue was firing up nicely out in the big open space where the western and Congolese bars collide: swanky lights, serious cocktails and high bar-stools on one side; a knocked-together wooden bar, a big Primus Bi\u00e8re sign on the wall and plastic garden furniture on the other. On good-weather nights, the roof opens up. The whole place is a cultural mash-up, in what feels like a good way. In the restaurant, there are paintings by Andy Warhol and Italian artists Alighiero e Boetti and Carla Accardi. A big wall-relief by Louise Nevelson is due to arrive. The decor is still being tinkered with. Out in the bar there's a huge portrait by Kinshasa-based painter Ch\u00e9ri Samba, and in a corner a seating area of Portuguese tiles, which continue up the wall, their glazed surfaces depicting the utopian, sci-fi apartment blocks of 1920s Russian architect Georgi Krutikow. Sometimes, it is hard to penetrate the logic.\n\nAs if this weren't confusing enough, there are three Congos, H\u00f6ller tells me. There's the former Belgian colony of DRC on one side of the river, and the much smaller former French colony of Congo-Brazzaville on the other. A third Congo exists entirely in the European mind, a mentality and a false memory that has at its core Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. What about today's civil war? It is far from Kinshasa, H\u00f6ller, a frequent visitor, tells me. He has been visiting the DRC, a place as big as western Europe, since around 2000, having first travelled to Benin in the mid-1990s. He fell in love with the music, the vitality and complexity of Congo's culture.\n\nH\u00f6ller himself is German, although born and brought up in Belgium. He now lives in Stockholm. Before becoming an artist, he was a biologist. I ask him what led him away from science: was it the nerdiness of science types, all those beards? The beards were definitely a problem, he says; scientists are so nervous of being regarded as charlatans, they don't want people to think they care what they look like.\n\nBut aren't people suspicious about art and artists, I ask - and is the Double Club an art work? Half art, half not, he tells me, like the slides. For a lot of people, especially the kids who used them, the slides were just a playground. Niceties about what might be art don't appear to worry H\u00f6ller. Not so long ago, he installed a carousel with chairs in chains in London's Gagosian gallery. He seems to like things that go round and round. The club, he says, is also here for people who are hungry, and people who want to drink, dance and meet their friends. H\u00f6ller admits he doesn't party much these days. He likes to spend his evenings at home, beside a lake near Stockholm, where he breeds nightingales for a hobby. I ask him if he's ever eaten one. Only the tongues, he tells me. This could be a wind-up, but there is something entirely genuine about the artist.\n\nEarlier this year, H\u00f6ller and I took part in a discussion about art and food at Ferran Adri\u00e0's world-famous El Bulli restaurant in Catalonia. During the discussion, chef Heston Blumenthal was wary of describing what he did as art, and H\u00f6ller also expressed doubts about his own status as an artist. \"I just want to play out some things in my life,\" he now says.\n\nH\u00f6ller is, I think, simply curious about the world. Just as the Double Club is intended to be two places at once, he likes the idea of spending half the year in Sweden, half in Africa. Like the nightingales, he says, on their annual migrations. This sounds magical, but the logistics come down to hard reality. As well as having Mazouz on board, the project has been overseen by Jan Kennedy, who opened the restaurant Quo Vadis with Marco Pierre White back in the 1990s. Design studios and architects have also played their part. H\u00f6ller is the impresario of all this.\n\nDescribing the fear, pleasure and out-of-control screaming abdabs some participants experienced as they sped earthward on his Tate slides, H\u00f6ller has talked about people as \"pleasure bundles\", and the effect his art has on us as bodies in space. Space is not just physical. And we are not only bodies in space, but minds, too. H\u00f6ller, I think, wants to take us out of ourselves and re-find some pleasure in the world. That includes eating, drinking and having fun. Does this make him an artist or just an entertainer?\n\nAfter a certain point in the evening, the question no longer seems interesting. Instead, we toy with our northern European winter comfort food, and the Congolese stews and barbecues, having our rumbles in the disco jungle, and following the footsteps of Kurtz in Heart of Darkness (\"The horror! The horror!\") as we spill out into the cold glare of the credit crunch, the 5am Islington morning.\n\nThe Double Club, at 7 Torrens Street, London EC1, opens tomorrow. Details: thedoubleclub.co.uk",

        "text": "Welcome to the post, post-Lehman era.\n\nEarlier this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported the results of self-administered stress tests. The results do not hold as much significance as the ones administered later this year by the Federal Reserve, but they were notable. For the first time since the financial crisis, the stress tests showed that, at a number of banks, a key measure of readiness for the next crisis had dropped.\n\nCitigroup C , for instance, said its tier one capital ratio\u2014the amount of money a bank has on hand to cover loan and investment losses\u2014would drop to 8.4% in another severe downturn. That\u2019s down from 9.1% a year ago. At Morgan Stanley MS , capital levels could fall to 8.9%, down from 9.5% a year ago. Wells Fargo WFC dipped to 9.6% from 9.9%. And JPMorgan Chase JPM said it would have enough capital after a stress scenario to cover losses on 8.4% of its remaining risky assets, down from 8.5% a year ago.\n\nGoldman Sachs GS was the only bank that came out looking better than it did last year, 10.4% versus 8.9%. Bank of America\u2019s BAC results were the same as they were last year.\n\nThe drops are relatively small. And the banks are still far more prepared for a downturn than they were before the last recession. But the banks have spent much of the past six years socking away extra cash to make them look as safe as possible. Now, the pendulum is swinging back.\n\nBut there were signs of that already. About a month ago, the FDIC reported that, as of mid-year, banks had boosted lending by nearly $400 billion in the past 12 months, the biggest jump since late 2008. Also, at the end of the second quarter, JPMorgan reported that it was taking increased risk on its trading desk. It appeared to be one of the few banks to do so. But the others are likely to follow. The banks will report new risk numbers a few weeks from now, along with their earnings reports.\n\nAlready, some regulators are getting nervous. Bank regulators have warned a number of banks about a return to risky lending. And the Fed is contemplating new rules that would require the big banks to continue to add to their capital piles.\n\nRemember, though, all of this renewed risk is good for the economy. While the Fed is telling banks not to take too much risk, its low interest rate policy is intended to get banks to lend more and, well, take more risk. And the fact that banks are lending more means the Fed\u2019s efforts have been, at least partly, a success.\n\nRegulators and the rest of us should not want the risk-taking pendulum to swing in just one direction. The question is whether the rules passed in the wake of the financial crisis will stop it from swinging too far back in the wrong direction.",
        "generated": "The results of self-administered stress tests conducted by the nation's largest banks showed a decrease in their ability to cover loan and investment losses, with the exception of Goldman Sachs, which showed an improvement, and Bank of America, which remained the same.",

The problem for enthusiasts of the virtual currency is that not only will they have to give the Feds a chunk of whatever capital gains they realize on their bitcoin holdings, the taxation of bitcoin as a currency will also constitute a serious hurdle for its widespread use.\n\nBitcoin, by design, is deflationary. After the 21 millionth bitcoin is mined, no more will ever be created. This distinguishes it from both fiat currencies, like the dollar, and even gold, the supplies of which grow over time. The problem is that as the economy and productivity grow, bitcoin will naturally become more valuable, creating a psychological incentive for people to hold onto rather than spend their bitcoin.

In other words, the capital gains tax is an incentive for bitcoin users to hold onto, rather then spend, their bitcoins.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve written earlier, the IRS\u2019s tax treatment of bitcoin has embedded in it the irony that your bitcoin tax bill will be directly proportional to the dollar\u2019s inflation.

        "text": "In all this chaos, Vladimir Putin is trying to grab the steering wheel. The reality is that today Assad\u2019s people are still killing more Syrians than Isil \u2013 but it is a close thing. It is also clear from intelligence that the US air campaign against the terrorist group has been causing it to change.\n\nWhile Iraqi Ba\u2019athists remain in firm control and their officers command the majority of the military capability made up of lowly Sunni Arab tribal fighters, their degradation has meant foreign fighters \u2013 including British subjects \u2013 are rising to command appointments and influential posts. Those who have had contact with the group have identified the British Jihadists as militarily inept, yet by far the most bloodthirsty. These people are increasingly unpalatable to the vast majority of the Sunni tribes who populate Isil territory.\n\nAlthough the majority of the Isil fighters are Sunni Arab tribal fighters, they are increasingly reluctantly so. Trapped between the Assad Shia regime and the Shia-dominated Iraqi regime, they are effectively stateless. This is a direct result of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. This was a situation that was bound to cause strife. It has handed Isil a constituency. They have driven out the Christians, Yazidis and Druze as well as other minorities, all in order to strengthen their grip.\n\nNow we need a diplomatic effort in tandem with bombing to wrest that constituency back. The Sunni Arabs of the region need a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, something to hope for if they are ever to rise up against Isil. The minorities need to believe they won\u2019t be slaughtered if they return. The bottom line is that we need to give Syrian and Iraqi Sunni Arabs (as well as Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and others) a homeland free from the control of Iran and its proxies and rid of Isil \u2013 a safe place to return to. Hope for jobs, education and dignity. None of that is in Russia or Iran\u2019s plan. It must be the war aim of ours. We have to grab the initiative.\n\nThat means carving out a new Arab homeland that is free from external control. Such an entity must take account of the needs and wishes of Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia as well as the Russians, Iran and the Iranian proxies. This plan must be forced through for a just peace.\n\nBut will bombing help? There is no doubt we must degrade Isil\u2019s military capability and we must eliminate those who are targeting the UK directly. But I believe that we must tackle Isil as part of a wider campaign to solve the bigger crisis, and to aid our allies \u2013 the Free Syrians and the Kurds. We must address the crisis that is generating the refugee wave and which is at the heart of the regional instability.\n\nSadly, President Obama has displayed a complete lack of leadership in the region. It is clear he is a follower, so there needs to be a leader. I look to David Cameron to step up. We need our other allies in Saudi and Turkey and Jordan to focus and back us up in confronting Assad and defeating Isil. That means accepting and backing a plan for a Sunni homeland. We need to agree demarcation lines with Russia and her ally Iran. That all will need British leadership.\n\nBut the starting point is that MPs must vote to support a campaign to bomb Isil. Ignore Corbyn. Labour MPs will vote supportively in sufficient numbers.

The law is set to take effect on Aug. 1.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Austin on Wednesday, requests a federal judge block license holders from bringing their guns to one of the nation\u2019s largest campuses, Reuters reports. The Texas law allows university presidents to enact their own rules regarding concealed handguns as long as those rules don\u2019t generally prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons on campus, and a 19-member task force at the University of Texas in Austin voted to recommend that concealed handguns be allowed in classrooms in December. The task force recommended concealed handguns be kept out of dormitories, however. Advocates of the law argue that it could protect students in the event of a mass shooting on campus.\n\nIn the suit, which named the state\u2019s attorney general, the university president and the university\u2019s board of regents as defendants, the professors argue that allowing students to carry concealed guns in classrooms \u201cchills their First Amendment rights to academic freedom\u201d by making it difficult for professors to discuss controversial or emotional subjects without fearing gun violence.\n\nThe law has already incited protest on the campus, with students staging a fake mass shooting in December, and an economics professor quitting over the \u201crisk that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom.\u201d\n\nUniversity officials are reviewing the lawsuit. The university president, Greg Fenves, approved properly licensed and concealed handguns in classrooms once the law takes effect earlier this year, though he has said he does \u201cnot believe handguns belong on a university campus.\u201d",

The Silicon Valley company is still appealing the Android case in Russia, which was opened last year after Yandex complained that its services for Android were being treated unfairly.\n\n\u201cWe have received notice of the fine from F.A.S. and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps,\u201d Google said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nGoogle dominates its service areas in much of the world, but it has failed so far to do so in Russia, where Yandex retains more than 50 percent of the market for internet search, according to industry statistics.\n\nWhile the Russian fine is akin to a rounding error compared with Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue, the ruling against Android is the newest setback for the company at a time of mounting global competition investigations into the search giant\u2019s activities.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official, charged Google in April with unfairly using Android to promote its own services \u2014 like Google Maps and Google Search \u2014 over those of its rivals.\n\nEuropean Union officials have also charged the company in a separate competition case, accusing it of favoring some of its search services over those of rivals. They filed a third set of charges in July linked to Google search services offered to third-party websites, like newspapers and online retailers.\n\nGoogle denies wrongdoing in those cases, saying that it competes on equal terms with companies like Yelp and Microsoft, among others. It also says that cellphone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches.\n\nThe company\u2019s antitrust woes have also spread to the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering claims that Google\u2019s activities linked to Android are uncompetitive. American officials previously investigated whether the company had unfairly favored some of its services over those of rivals within its search engine, but they eventually decided not to bring charges.\n\nAnd in India, one of Google\u2019s fast-growing markets, the national antitrust authority sent the company a report last year outlining its concerns about search dominance and anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe Indian officials suggested that the company was abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people with knowledge of the report, which has not been made public.\n\nFollow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 12, 2016, on page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Fine in Russia Is Reminder of the Obstacles at Google.

        "text": "On Saturday, the Australian freestyler Mack Horton was in the warm-down pool before the competition when Sun, his main rival, vigorously splashed him, as if to get his attention.\n\nSun served a three-month suspension in 2014 for taking a banned stimulant.\n\n\u201cI ignored him,\u201d Horton, 20, said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have time or respect for drug cheats.\u201d\n\nThat night, Horton out-touched Sun for the gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle. Horton did not acknowledge him in the water and later called it \u201ca win for the good guys,\u201d although he and Sun did shake hands during the medal ceremony.\n\nMembers of the Chinese swimming team expressed outrage about Horton\u2019s actions, with the team manager Xu Qi calling for an apology. None has been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cMack obviously has very strong views about the need for clean sport, as every single one of us does,\u201d said the Australian delegation\u2019s chef de mission, Kitty Chiller. \u201cHe has every right to express his views and his displeasure in that sense.\u201d\n\nThe current Olympians Dana Vollmer and Cody Miller and past winners weighed in on the doping controversy at the Rio Games that has resulted in tiffs between Lilly King and Russian swimmers who were booed.\n\nSun went on to win the gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle Monday night.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t belong in a sport,\u201d Camille Lacourt, a star French swimmer, said Monday night in comments reported by the French newspaper L\u2019\u00c9quipe. \u201cThey should make up their federation of dopers and have fun among themselves. It disgusts me to see people who\u2019ve cheated standing on podiums. Sun Yang, in the 200 free, he pees purple.\u201d\n\nThat night, the American swimmer Lilly King, 19, cited Horton as an influence when she spoke out about Efimova.\n\nKing entered the Rio Games with the top time in the world this year in the women\u2019s 100-meter breaststroke. The next-fastest swimmer in the lead-up to the competition was Efimova, a 24-year-old Russian whose place at these Olympics was not confirmed until Saturday.\n\nEfimova, the reigning world champion, had served a 16-month doping suspension handed down by swimming\u2019s global governing body, known as FINA, a ban that ended in early 2015. Early this year, Efimova failed a test for the newly banned drug meldonium, but the result was overturned when she appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, arguing that she had already served her penalty.\n\nEvery time Efimova has raced inside the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, she has been booed. King demonstrated her disapproval in another way. After posting the fastest time in qualifying on Sunday afternoon, King wagged her finger to remind everyone who was No. 1.\n\nAs King looked on from the ready room, where swimmers gather before they race, Efimova won the first semifinal and mimicked King\u2019s move. King went out and won the second semifinal and shook her finger again.\n\nA spokesman for the International Olympic Committee said that fans want \u201cfair play\u201d from athletes amid tensions over doping and that the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, wants a life ban for serious doping.\n\nIn a postrace interview with NBC, King said, \u201cYou wave your finger No. 1, and you\u2019ve been caught drug cheating?\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan.\u201d\n\nIn a group interview in the mixed zone, King defended her actions. \u201cI\u2019m not this sweet little girl,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\nAll the finger wagging set the stage for the final on Monday night, when their score was settled in the pool. King occupied Lane 4. Efimova was in Lane 5. It was a duel at 100 meters. King turned first at the 50 and hung on to win with a time of 1 minute 4.93 seconds. It was her best time and an Olympic record. Efimova was second in 1:05.50, 19-hundredths of a second ahead of King\u2019s American teammate Katie Meili.\n\nAfter the race, King hung on the lane line that separated her from Efimova and splashed twice in Efimova\u2019s lane. King said she had not done it on purpose. But she also studiously avoided contact with Efimova.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she really wants to be congratulated by me,\u201d King said.\n\nThe news conference featuring the medal winners felt more like a trial than a triumphant review. King sat at the opposite end of the table from Efimova. Meili was in the middle seat, normally reserved for the gold medalist. Neither King nor Meili looked at Efimova, who was on the verge of tears from the opening question about the boos directed at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy I\u2019m here and racing,\u201d said Efimova, who looked miserable. She appealed to people \u201cto try to understand me,\u201d but King, who sat stone-faced through Efimova\u2019s answers, did not appear moved.\n\nSam Manchester will guide you through the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nHey. It\u2019s Sam from the NYT Sports desk. I\u2019m at the Olympics in Rio (so you don\u2019t have to be :)). Grab a limited spot and I\u2019ll text you updates, answer your questions and share the behind-the-scenes stuff nobody else gets.\n\nThanks! Talk to you soon.\n\nU.S. numbers only. Standard messaging rates may apply. Your information is used only to deliver messages about the Rio 2016 Olympics.\n\nAt one point, Efimova switched from English to Russian. The moderator nudged a pair of headphones toward King and told her she could use them to listen to the English translation. King declined, as did Meili.\n\nWhat is striking is that the antidoping chorus in Rio has consisted of newcomers and veterans alike, with Olympic rookies like Horton, of Australia, and King joining the 31-year-old Lacourt and Michael Phelps, who is also 31 and is the most decorated athlete in Olympic history.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the desire of Olympic athletes to uphold the values of the Olympic Games without exception,\u201d Adam Nelson, an American shot-putter and activist for athletes\u2019 rights, said in an email Monday.\n\nNelson was named the winner of the 2004 Olympic shot-put competition eight years after it was contested when the original champion, Yuriy Bilonog of Ukraine, retroactively tested positive for a banned substance.\n\n\u201cThese athletes know, when an athlete cheats, he or she will experience a residual physical benefit for many years,\u201d Nelson added. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a residual sentiment that negatively impacts the sport moving forward. The clouds of suspicion that linger over doped athletes who return to competition continue to take a toll on the value of the clean athlete.\u201d\n\nThere is not yet conclusive evidence on the long-term benefits to performance for athletes who took banned substances earlier in their careers. And as Thomas Bach, the I.O.C.\u2019s president, has repeatedly pointed out, lifetime bans from sports for doping offenses have not proved legally defensible. In the cases of men like Sun and Justin Gatlin, the once-barred American sprinter who has been another target of athletes\u2019 criticism since his return, they are being called out even though the system in place gives them every right to resume competing.\n\nKing said Monday night that she believed any athlete with a doping offense \u2014 including Gatlin \u2014 should not be allowed to compete. The national governing body for track and field, U.S.A. Track & Field, issued a statement on Tuesday rejecting that notion.\n\n\u201cThe WADA code indicates that when an individual has completed their suspension, they are eligible to re-engage in the sport,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Amateur Sports Act stipulates that if an athlete is eligible to compete, they cannot be prevented from being on a national team. So in the United States, it is a matter of law. If you are not under a ban, regardless of what you may have served in the past, you are fully eligible to be on the team.\u201d\n\nStill, Nelson defended the right of athletes to criticize once-barred competitors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not undermining the system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt highlights a major flaw in the system. Ms. King could have lost out on an Olympic gold medal future had the events turned out differently yesterday, and she would have had to accept the fact that a known doper beat her. Where\u2019s the spirit of Olympism in that outcome?\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 10, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Rio Pool, Disdain for Dopers Is Bubbling Over.

The estranged couple appeared at Brooklyn Supreme Court on Thursday morning, where a judge urged the pair to settle their dispute outside of court, according to the defendant's attorney, Harold Mayerson.\n\nA rep for Vereen tells PEOPLE that the actor originally filed for divorce from Andrea back in 1972 \u2013 and that she filed her own divorce paperwork two years later in 1974.

Earlier on Thursday, he told\n\n, \"This is a personal matter, and nothing has been proven yet.\"\n\nMayerson, who is representing Andrea, tells PEOPLE that his client believed she had been divorced for decades, and only learned that the marriage was not legally dissolved recently when she went to collect Social Security.\n\n\"Mr. Vereen told her years ago they were divorced,\" Mayerson explains. \"But when she applied for Social Security, she found out that not only are they not divorced, but that some other woman is collecting under his name.\"\n\nThat woman, Nancy Bruner, married Vereen in Los Angeles in 1976. They ultimately divorced in 2012. However, according to Mayerson, Vereen would have had to mention the date of his divorce on his California marriage certificate. \"That's what's fishy about this,\" says Mayerson.\n\nThe attorney adds that after Andrea discovered she was still married, he contacted Vereen's team to work out a solution. \"We were negotiating with them, and they really didn't want to give much of anything,\" he explains. \"And then they, inexplicably in my opinion, filed this lawsuit [for divorce].\"\n\nWhile Mayerson does not believe that Vereen is \"a bad guy,\" he hopes that the singer/dancer \"will respect the fact that this woman raised his son and do the right thing.\" He adds, \"He left this young girl \u2013 she was 14 and pregnant at the time \u2013 to raise a child by herself in New York City, which was not easy at the time for an African-American woman, and life was tough.\"\n\nThe attorney says that Vereen has a union pension, has not collected Social Security yet and earned as much as $400,000 last year alone. \"It's not as though he's impoverished,\" Mayerson explains. Andrea, one the other hand, he says, \"has lived exceptionally modestly her whole life. She's a religious women, was a pastor, worked in churches, sang in choirs and was scraping everywhere along the way with virtually no help from him.\"\n\nWhile Andrea's lawyer is confident that the judge will rule in her favor, he is still hopeful the parties will reach a settlement outside of court. \"We're hopeful there will be a settlement before we go to trial and that Mr. Vereen will come to his good senses and get this settled and have a great twilight to his career.\"\n\nVereen, now 69, won best actor in a musical at the 1973 Tonys for his portrayal of\n\nand has also appeared in numerous films and television series.",

        "text": "Vin Scully was impressed with me as a broadcaster \u2026 at least that's what he told me.\n\nIt has been 23 years since I shared a booth with the Dodgers' legendary broadcaster, who's calling it a career this week after 67 years on the job. But when you were in the presence of greatness, you tend to remember all the details.\n\nOn May 19, 1993, I was part of a team that delivered the first Mandarin Chinese broadcast from a Major League Baseball game.\n\nWhen the Dodgers faced the Cincinnati Reds that day at Dodger Stadium, four radio booths were occupied to air the game -- in English, Spanish, Korean and Chinese.\n\nI was just out of college at the time, working at the Pasadena Star-News. When a press release announcing the game would be broadcast in Chinese made its way to our newsroom, I jumped at the chance. I lobbied the radio station to bring me on (pro bono, of course) to be part of the announcing team, selling my ability as a fluent speaker of both English and Chinese as well as my \"expertise\" in baseball.\n\nIt worked. Thomas Kao, the original announcer who was a local talk show host, graciously asked me to be his sidekick. I bounded into Dodger Stadium that afternoon with unbridled enthusiasm. It wasn't that I hadn't covered a Dodgers game before, but this occasion was much different. It was historic, and I knew I'd get to share a booth with the Hall of Fame voice of the Dodgers.\n\nAs the game went on, I took over more of the play-by-play duties as Kao did the scene-setting. S.C. Chao and Jerry Sung, famous baseball players from Taiwan, were also in the booth as our color analysts. For a first-time group that's never worked together before, I thought we had pretty decent chemistry.\n\nThen Scully walked in at the end of the third inning. The way the Dodgers radio broadcasts were set up at the time, Vin did the first and last three innings of the game, with him taking a break in the middle innings. He'd spend the fourth inning with us.\n\nI was thrilled and nervous at the same time. I remember telling myself: \"Do not stutter!\"\n\nBut Scully was as gregarious and gracious in person as his listeners have come to know during a career that began in Brooklyn in 1950. He sat down between Kao and me and immediately put us at ease. He asked us some questions (with me translating for our Chinese audience) and I did some in return. At one point, I asked him to call a few pitches and plays for our listeners, and he happily obliged.\n\nAs the inning went on, I had the occasion to describe a near double-play ball started by Reds shortstop Barry Larkin. When I finished, Vin was effusive in his praise, telling me my call was \"terrific,\" even though he didn't speak Mandarin and probably didn't understand what I said besides \"Larkin.\" But his reaction was so enthusiastic and genuine, if I had died at that moment it would've been a life well lived.\n\nThat call ended up on an NBC News feature and was part of the highlights package on that night's ESPN SportsCenter. We also were visited in the booth by then-Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley. The team was delighted with the broadcast and invited us back for a few more that season.

        "text": "This summer, like most others, has been a pretty quiet one for the video game industry. Notable releases have been few and far between, and sales numbers haven't typically been eye-popping.\n\nWhen the clock struck 12 a.m., \"Madden NFL 09\" hit store shelves. Thousands of retailers around the country, including Best Buy (nyse: BBY - news - people ), Wal-Mart (nyse: WMT - news - people ) and GameStop (nyse: GME - news - people ), hosted launch parties for fans who couldn't wait until a more civilized hour of the morning to get their hands on the game.\n\nIt will likely sell between 2 million and 3 million copies within a month. By the end of the year, it's sure to be one of the industry's top 10 selling titles.\n\n\"Madden\" is to the gaming industry what the Macy's Thanksgiving parade is to retailers: the official start of the holiday season. Its release kicks off the avalanche of top-tier game releases that will continue through mid-December.\n\nIt's also the premier game in Electronic Arts' (nasdaq: ERTS - news - people ) catalog, selling more than 70 million copies in its history. Sports titles account for roughly a third of the game publisher's $3.7 billion fiscal 2008 revenues.\n\nWith \"Madden\" now in its 20th year, the publisher is pulling out all the stops. On Monday, EA hosted a massive celebration and launch event for the game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Fans were able to rub shoulders with former Madden cover athletes and see performances by some of the bands who have used the game's soundtrack as a launching pad for new singles, albums and, in some cases, careers. Good Charlotte and Busta Rhymes were among those scheduled to perform.\n\nDespite the hoopla surrounding the anniversary, analysts expect this year's \"Madden\" will have trouble topping sales of its predecessors. Colin Sebastian, senior vice president of equity research at Lazard Capital Markets, says he expects \"Madden NFL 09\" will sell roughly 4.5 million copies this fiscal year--more or less what the previous version sold last year.\n\n\"I would say the brand, to this day, is very important, but we saw a decline in sales last year, so there has been the concern that there are cracks in the foundation for EA Sports,\" he says.\n\nIt's not customer loyalty that's to blame. Football is the great equalizer in the video game world, reaching both the hard-core and casual gamer. \"Madden\" consistently has been the one title that appeals firmly to both.\n\nRather, it's the ongoing transition to the newest generation of consoles that's stunting growth. The PlayStation 2 has historically been an important part of Madden's sales base, and software sales for the platform are rapidly declining. As the Wii becomes the dominant hardware in the industry, third-party publishers haven't had much luck in capturing audience they did with the PS2. (EA hopes to attract that audience with a new feature that lets the game adapt to a player's skills.)\n\nNot that sales of 4.5 million are anything to sneeze at. Typically, any title that sells over a million copies is considered an overwhelming success.\n\nOther publishers, recognizing the strength of the Madden brand, act much the way movie studios do when a major release comes out in theaters: They stay out of the way. But after the Madden juggernaut primes the pump at retail, the free-for-all will begin for gamers' dollars.\n\nEA follows up \"Madden\" with the long-anticipated \"Spore\" from Will Wright, creator of \"The Sims,\" on Sept. 4. MTV is up next with \"Rock Band 2\" on Sept. 14. By November, Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ) and Sony (nyse: SNE - news - people ) will be duking it out with \"Gears of War 2\" and \"Resistance 2,\" respectively. Nintendo (other-otc: NTDOY.PK - news - people ), meanwhile, will offer up \"Animal Crossing: City Folk\". Other expected hit titles include \"Little Big Planet,\" \"Fallout 3\" and \"Left 4 Dead\".\n\nSome of these games may outsell this year's \"Madden.\" (And Take-Two Interactive Software's (nasdaq: TTWO - news - people ) \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" released earlier this year, certainly will.)\n\nDon't let a single year's sales numbers fool you, though. The Madden franchise, after 20 years, remains a consistent performer for EA--one the company can rely on. For all the pomp and circumstance that accompanies the release of a new \"Halo\" (or some other marquee title), these games can't compare to the numbers \"Madden\" turns in year after year.\n\nXbox + Netflix: Who's Next?",

        "text": "05.25: Waiting in departure lounge of RAF Brize Norton. After wake up call at 04.00, breakfast at 04.30, I have successfully checked in for my C17 transporter flight to Kandahar. I am the only passenger.\n\nDressed in combat trousers, desert boots, body armour and with a 20kg bag as hand-luggage, I am relieved to be ready and in the right place. [...]\n\nAt 06.30, I am called to board the RAF C17. A small woman appears, looking flustered, and suggests I follow her ... The crew are already aboard. I am led up the steps of the squat plane and motioned toward one of the canvas jump seats fixed to the side of the fuselage ... Half a million rounds of palletised ammunition is cargo netted around me.\n\n04/11/07 Arrival at Camp Bastion\n\nI find myself sitting among a squad of Royal Marine Commandos. They appear incredibly young. One of them, who looks like a teenager, is wearing a commando knife in his chest webbing. It is hard to reconcile my recognition of this student-aged man with the 8in blade fastened at the ready on his armour. After a strange, propeller-powered 45 minutes I wake to realise that we had all been lulled into a fitful sleep by the drone of the engines. [...]\n\nThe ramp opens to reveal the orange light of Bastion. The sun is setting and vast amounts of dust have been thrown into the air by the landing. The diffused glow of the sun appears to ignite the sky. In the distance I see a burning plume of smoke (apparently the 24-hour waste fires).\n\nAt 07.00, the lights in the tent crackle to life.\n\nI am surrounded by activity. The shower block \"ablutions\", like everything else, are semi-communal. I feel conspicuously unfit and I try to pretend that my ponytail is not noticeable. [...]\n\nI have an invitation to attend the \"ops\" briefing at the MED GRP CP. Acronyms describe all units, events and places. I imagine the briefing is confidential, but even if it weren't, I would need a code book to decipher the language of common usage. \"Enhanced threat of VBIED reported by RC FOB Delhi\" = Enhanced threat of vehicle-bourne improvised explosive device reported by regional command, forward operating base Delhi. [...]\n\nAn insurgent has been captured and MERT [the medical emergency response team] have brought him for treatment. It seems that he was a suspected mortar commander and has been shot in the leg. We photograph the helicopter approaching and find ourselves coated in dust as the Chinook \"wheels down\" (WD).\n\nThe suspected Taliban fighter is blindfolded and searched carefully with metal detectors before being allowed entrance. A team of about 10 people is waiting. Notes are taken in triplicate as x-rays are taken digitally and he is stripped and prepared for surgery. The wound is not life-threatening and within 10 minutes he is being wheeled, already sedated, into theatre.\n\nThe MASH-style theatre is an amazing venue. Under canvas like the rest of the hospital, the theatrical lighting of the operating spotlights adds to the incongruity of surgeons with blue gowns over Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) camouflage uniforms. We stand well back beyond a striped line on the floor, attempting to understand from a distance what is happening in the bubble of intensity at the far end of the dome tent.06/11/07 First operation\n\nAt 10.00, a nine-liner starts to come through the \"Jchat\" system: a T1 casualty (meaning evacuation needed within an hour or less - life threatened). I rush to my tent to assemble a selection of lenses. I feel a little vulgar; my role is sinister, an ambulance chaser with a camera. I am here [sent by the Wellcome Collection] to consider \"War and Medicine\" - the role of healthcare in combat. I have never been in the military and have never seen an operation. I am a trauma tourist desperately trying to justify my role - to others but, more difficultly, to myself.\n\nBy 11.00, the helicopter has not returned. I begin to hear little bits of news. The casualty may be in a minefield. It will take at least another hour for the other soldiers and engineers to inch their way toward him. He has self-administered morphine and is conscious. I find it impossible to imagine: two hours with a mine injury awake and unable to move. At 13.00, the Chinook finally arrives. As it swings on to the HLS [helicopter landing strip], the sand washes over the waiting Land Rover ambulances, and medics run from both vehicles to meet and make the exchange. The soldier is wheeled across. I watch from a distance with a telephoto lens. By the time I have walked past the quartermaster's office to the entrance, the ambulances have arrived. As always, a crowd of some of the NHS's most highly paid and skilled consultants are waiting in DPM clothing.\n\nHe is taken to Resus. Awake, in pain and bloody. The doctors adopt varying roles. One doctor stands with a nurse and an administrator at a lectern taking notes of every observation. Others direct the x-ray team, manage the unwrapping of the field dressings, check the vital signs, look for internal bleeding and try to calm the soldier. He is young; I suspect, a Commando.\n\nHis right leg has been bandaged in three field dressings - each one can absorb a litre of blood. His foot is unwrapped and clothes are cut away. It strikes me that all the kit fetish that follows the FOB [forward operating base] postings is discarded. The boots, the webbing, holsters and DPM are cut into pieces, and deposited into a black plastic bag for incineration.\n\nThe most obvious injury is to his foot. Bone and flesh hang from its centre. The heel protrudes about 2in below the base of his sole.\n\nThe x-ray explains. There are no fragments of shrapnel. The force of the blast has travelled through the armoured vehicle into his foot and, with devastating effect, has forced the bones from the base of the foot upwards. The neat lattice of bone and tendon has been rotated and pushed away from his heel. The anaesthetist is beginning his work. The soldier keeps shouting \"Sir!\" as he deliriously looks around \"Don't take my legs,\" he appeals. \"Have I got my legs?\" He doesn't believe the doctor who reassures him.\n\nI find myself cold and sweating profusely. I struggle to stop myself fainting. I must not faint. His right leg has multiple fractures and the knee is crushed. His left leg is also broken.\n\nHe is still conscious as they wheel him to theatre. The surgeons wear gowns over their DPM and plastic covers over their desert boots. The soldier is put to sleep, and intense but unhurried activity takes place to untangle the mess of bone and skin. Pieces of bone come off the base of his feet in the surgeon's hands. He cuts away the last bits of muscle and skin symbolically attaching the bone fragments to the soldier and places them in a steel tray. The foot is emptied of dead tissue and takes on the form of a near empty bag of skin. The toes are still attached and have the appearance of some remaining circulation. I pray that the surgeons will decide that the foot will survive.\n\nDespite their appearance, the surgeon suspects that they are no longer salvageable. One of the doctors suggests to me that the best case for him will be to lose the lower part of his right leg. I listen quietly but am horrified.\n\nBy 15.30, the operation is nearly complete; the wounds are left open and packed with gauze. No amputation will happen here. They will allow the soldier to return to Britain as he is. The decision will be made in Selly Oak. Two more injured patients are waiting for theatre.\n\nI feel dislocated and aimless. I am not certain if my anxiety comes from my ethical fears of delivering a facile response or from the thwarting of adolescent fantasies. I am not certain of my own intentions.08/11/07\n\nTwo Afghan children and their dignified elderly-looking father appear from the ambulances. I am struck by how beautiful they are. The son has shrapnel to his face and is in pain. The daughter has a wound to her leg and looks like aliens have abducted her. She is wide-eyed and confused. All three are covered in a thick layer of desert dust. I leave them as they are stabilised in Resus, unable to face another operation so soon.\n\nAt about 16.00, the hospital fills. Clerks are rushing to don surgical gowns. Rumours are spreading. Hell at Inkerman (commonly renamed as \"Incoming\"): 2 T1s, 2 T2s + 1 T3. A \"major\" incident is declared. Eight more wounded may also be on their way. There are only two theatre teams.\n\nThis is the first major incident \"mass casualty\" for the hospital squadron. It is what they have trained for, but there is some uncertainty as to the point at which capacity will be reached.\n\nIn Inkerman, the landing zone is still hot. The Apaches have spent 20 minutes attacking fire points before the Chinooks can land. Eventually, we hear the sound of the helicopters and in less than a minute, ambulances begin ferrying patients.\n\nLeg and chest wounds. I notice two men's chests displaying the flutter of Asherman chest seals rhythmically rising as air escapes their collapsed lungs. One of the soldiers is wearing two CAT (combat application) tourniquets and has had his boots tied together, trapping an improvised splint. The beds in Resus fill. X-rays, clothes cut away. Cleaning away the dirt of battle and consultants comparing notes. MERT medics arrive, covered in dust and in full body armour, to brief the Resus staff. They appear as if parachuted into A&E.\n\nPeriodically, the senior medics pause and convene to compare priorities. I am impressed by this restraint. A scene of violent injuries is dealt with in a strange, professional way. Any one of the cases would be life-threatening. Here they seem to be received as routine.\n\nThe first priority becomes visible. As the clothes are cut away, the bizarre and gory scene is unwrapped. There is a gap in his legs. His thighs appear missing. I feel sick, as I mistakenly fear his groin may have also been destroyed. Bloody rags and gauze are piled around his legs and in the distance I see figures frantically attending to his mangled body.\n\nI withdraw to meet the surgeons grabbing one last cigarette before the casualties become their charge.\n\nCaptain Paul Britton is scheduled [for surgery] later that morning. He was wounded at Inkerman and evacuated with shrapnel embedded in his shoulder and hand. He had been injured at the same time as last night's casualties, but had refused to leave his squad. A fire-support commander, he had been in charge of a small (now depleted) team controlling mortars, air-strikes, artillery and Javelin surface-to-air missiles.\n\nBritton has a shaved head and full beard. [The surgeon] asks him if he minds being filmed. The response causes hilarity among the nurses: \"Just make sure he gets my good side.\"\n\nI set up the camera and step back. I can't face another operation and leave as the camera observes for me.\n\nI pass the tent chapel and a padre jumps out. \"I've been looking for you,\" he says. \"I believe you came to see me earlier when I was out.\" It is true that I had found myself wandering in to the church a few hours earlier. In a slightly maudlin moment I had heard music and followed it inside. It is a cliche to seek redemption and faith in times of fear or trauma. I was feeling both and had found myself enacting the stereotypical route to religion.\n\nThe mass of lines and tubes almost conceals the mummified soldier. The bulk of the equipment fights against the confined space of the ambulance. Five medics gingerly slide Fletcher's life-support equipment past the snags and handles of the Land Rover ambulance. I sit in the front and we move off at the regulation 15mph. [...]\n\nDuring take-off and the flight, I am struck by the kindness displayed by the nurses in armour. Even Fletcher is reassured and comforted in his fitful sleep.\n\nWe descend in darkness to Kandahar and as the ramp opens we feel the aircraft spinning around. A majestic sight comes into view. The open ramp of a C17 is waiting, framing an illuminated strategic team. The C130 backs up to its larger sibling until 50 yards of ashphalt separates the two worlds of tactical and strategic care. [...]\n\nStanding on the runway between these two great transport aircraft, I watch the stretchers being ferried across, illuminated by an honour guard of ambulances and Toyota pick-up trucks. I feel a strange sense of calm as the patients, strapped into the stretchers and protected by an assortment of Day-Glo equipment, are received by the C17 strategic CCAST [combat medical technician] team. I feel that some of the tension has passed away. They are crossing a threshold on the runway between combat and care. Their guilt about leaving the friends and duty, which appears so present at Bastion, seems to be left in the Hercules. As the stretcher crosses the halfway point between craft, it crosses a threshold. The gravitational pull of home overtakes the longing for the immersive FOB community. Powerless to resist, there is no shame for the soldiers. Their injuries answer any inquiries. The comfort, care and cleanliness of the civilian world beckons. The CCAST envoys welcome their cargo, outnumbering the patients three to one, and envelop them in the warm light of the C17 cathedral.\n\nDuring my month-long stay in Helmand, two British soldiers died, 29 were wounded in action and there were 74 admissions to the field hospital. Seventy-one Aeromed evacuations were recorded and an undisclosed number of civilian, insurgent and Afghan National Army soldiers were treated. I arrived back in Britain feeling a great sense of anger. I was frustrated by my previous ignorance of the frequency of injury. Soldiers are surviving wounds that would often have been fatal in previous conflicts. Body armour, medical training and the proximity of advanced surgery to the front line have led to a \"disproportionate\" number of casualties surviving.\n\nIn the media, we hear only about the deaths, with occasional reference to the wounded. I came home assuming the violence I had witnessed in Afghanistan would be the focus of the news. But reality television, local politics and other less dramatic events occupied the headlines. For me, the incongruity between what I had seen and what was presented as the public face of conflict was, and continues to be, profound and irreconcilable.\n\n\u2022 War and Medicine is at the Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, London NW1 until February 15.

        "text": "With Jane (Jaimie Alexander) in a state of near-constant panic over her identity, Dr. Borden (Ukweli Roach) administers a Rorschach test. But all Jane's got is the memory of weapons training in the woods with the ruggedly handsome man. Meanwhile, Weller (Sullivan Stapleton) has breakfast with his sister Sarah and her son Sawyer, who have moved in while looking for an apartment. Sarah mentions their father called to ask if they're attending Taylor's yearly memorial? Weller is definitely not interested. At work, he tells Patterson (Ashley Johnson) that he noticed a scar on the back of Jane's neck. Then he runs Jane through more weapons training, hoping to trigger another memory. One thing's for sure: Jane knows her guns, and she now remembers shooting a nun in the back of the head. Stunned, she refrains from telling Weller, just as word arrives that Chao is dead of a massive stroke. Surveillance footage shows a man walking away from Chao's room as everyone else rushes toward it... Suddenly, Patterson announces that she's decoded a Vigen\u00e8re cipher on Jane's neck: Maj. Arthur Gibson - a Silver Star-awarded pilot, who once injured, left a desk job in Nevada to work for the Air Force in New York. Convinced Gibson may know something about her, Jane insists on accompanying the team to his home in Brooklyn. Refusing to talk, Gibson orders the team off his property. As they head back to their SUV, Gibson's house explodes.\n\nThe only thing that survives the explosion is a wall safe - no sign of Gibson. The team questions Air Force Colonel Margaret Powers, who explains that after experiencing collateral damage on a mission, Gibson's increasing paranoia and PTSD earned him a desk job and, ultimately, a discharge. But after reviewing Gibson's files, Patterson finds that not only did the Air Force not fire Gibson, they promoted him - and gave him top security clearance. Weller figures the Air Force made Gibson a drone pilot, which means there must be a drone program in New York. Meanwhile, Gibson kidnaps Emily, the six-year-old daughter of his co-worker Alex, in order to force his assistance in launching an armed drone. Moments later, the drone drops a missile on Colonel Powers as she's getting into her SUV. Frustrated, Reade (Rob Brown) wonders whether Jane and her tattoos are to blame. Weller insists it's not Jane's fault; they need to focus on finding Gibson.\n\nFurious, Mayfair (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) calls General Fitzmorris, who admits Gibson worked for a secret domestic drone surveillance program, and the drone he now controls is armed with two more missiles. Distraught over the general's disregard for Emily's welfare, Weller blows up, so Mayfair orders him to stand down. While Reade speculates that whoever tattooed Jane knew about the drone program, Jane flashes back to shooting the nun. Maybe her tattoos are some kind of penance? Mayfair pulls Weller aside, to chastise him for yelling at Fitzmorris. Weller admits he's been thinking about Taylor, who went missing 25 years ago when he was 10. In his last memory of her, Taylor fell while climbing a tree, leaving a scar on the back of her neck - the same scar as Jane's. Weller knows why his name is on Jane's back: Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw.\n\nPaterson cracks Gibson's safe, finding an air-gapped laptop with a list of five seemingly unrelated domestic accidents - yet the victims of each incident were all from the Middle East. Gibson's initials are associated with three, the initials I.M. with the other two. Patterson thinks I.M. is Major Ivon Musgrave, so the team scrambles to his Brooklyn apartment. When Musgrave runs, Jane gives chase. An intense fight ensues, until Weller intervenes, hauling Musgrave onto the street. Musgrave demands to talk to Colonel Powers, just as Jane spies the man from her memory. That's when the second missile hits, blowing the team back into the apartment building. Jane rushes to help an injured Reade, then stumbles back to the street, but the man from her flashback is gone. Back at HQ, Musgrave explains that Gibson wanted to expose the drone program, which was rife with collateral damage. When he asked for help, Musgrave turned him in, then helped the Air Force destroy Gibson's life. Since Gibson has one missile left and is dead set on destroying the program, Weller asks Fitzmorris where the drone pilots work from... and it's the top three floors of the building they're in. Twice a day, every pilot is in the building for a shift change, which is in one hour.\n\nAs the building evacuation begins, Patterson narrows Gibson's location to one of two construction sites in Brooklyn. On the way, Jane tells Weller that she did remember something... what if she's a terrible person? Insisting Jane has a good heart, Weller leaves her in the car, then runs to check the roof. After a firefight, Gibson takes the elevator down as Weller tries and fails to warn Jane. Gibson open fires on the SUV, then drives off, so Jane decides to follow, forcing a crash and rolling her own car, which brings on another flashback. The nun is actually a soldier in disguise. After the shooting, Jane pulls a coded USB fob from around his neck. After pulling a woozy Jane out of the SUV, Weller extracts Emily's location from Gibson and returns the little girl to her father.\n\nBack at HQ, the team argues about the day's events. The Air Force has already come up with a cover story for the press, and Reade isn't convinced Jane's tattoo saved thousands of lives. Mayfair pulls Weller aside to advise that Patterson is running DNA tests to confirm whether Jane truly is Taylor. But Weller doesn't need test results - even if he's not ready to tell Jane. That night, he runs his theory by his sister. Stunned, Sarah reviews how this could change all their lives: their father was accused of kidnapping and killing Taylor, causing their mother to leave. Weller has spent the last 25 years believing his father murdered Taylor... and now their father is dying of pancreatic cancer. Soon. Across town, Jane is surveying the dismal contents of her safe house refrigerator when someone grabs her from behind... the ruggedly handsome man.",

        "text": "Mrs. Clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before California holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party\u2019s nomination. But in choosing to raise concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy stances, she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a Trump presidency.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal Democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances, her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering Republicans to support her this fall.\n\nRoughly 21 percent of independent voters and 32 percent of Republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security, compared with 16 percent of Democrats, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll conducted last month. At the same time, 61 percent of registered voters said a Trump presidency would make America\u2019s image in the world worse, according to the latest New York Times-CBS News poll.\n\n\u201cThere are many Republicans concerned about this,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, an American ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration who also served on Bill Clinton\u2019s National Security Council, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThey find his policy positions beyond the pale, and they\u2019re also turned off by his vulgarity.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the Clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate Republicans who could endorse Mrs. Clinton, largely making the case for foreign policy sure-footedness.\n\nThose calls have included to an aide of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and to Nicholas F. Brady, who served as secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, with plans to reach out to James A. Baker III, a White House chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state under President George Bush.\n\nIn her debates with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions, including urging the Obama administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which she later said was a mistake.\n\nDonald J. Trump told a crowd in Sacramento that NATO states and other allies should be paying the United States compensation for all the U.S. has done for them.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. \u201cBernie Sanders said it and I\u2019m going to use it all over the place because it\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe is a woman who is ill-suited to be president because she has bad judgment.\u201d\n\nAs each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the Oval Office, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are preparing to make a case against Mr. Trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the campaign against McCain or Romney, which was two competing visions,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former White House and Pentagon official under President Obama.\n\nInstead, he said, Mrs. Clinton will remind voters that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un have expressed support for Mr. Trump, who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with Mr. Kim, a pariah worldwide.\n\nMrs. Clinton will also accuse Mr. Trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of American diplomacy that every president has adhered to since World War II.\n\nJulianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the Brussels-based coalition of European nations. Mrs. Clinton, she added, needed to explain to voters that \u201cevery single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances\u201d and that \u201cplaying by the rules makes sense for all of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was \u201cfraudulent\u201d in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions, explaining that he supported global alliances, but believed that the United States should shoulder less of the financial burden.\n\n\u201cOur country can\u2019t afford to protect the world anymore, and at least not get reimbursed for it,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the American-led operation to defeat the Islamic State, ending the economic embargo against Cuba, and pledging unwavering support of Israel.\n\nAnd she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201creckless actions\u201d on foreign policy.\n\nThe San Diego speech, to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when Mr. Trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans\u2019 groups, will present a more sweeping \u2014 and fearsome \u2014 portrayal of Mr. Trump, one that the Clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cThis is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose, not individual policy proposals.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers, who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call for a no-fly zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to Europe. But Mr. Trump, in addressing foreign policy, has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters\u2019 emotional concerns that America has lost its standing in the world.\n\n\u201cYou do get the sense that he\u2019s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate \u2014 and I consider it a minority \u2014 that couldn\u2019t be less interested in facts or realities,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways.\u201d",

The GOP front-runner proposes tax cuts across all income levels, and slashing taxes for those making up to $50,000.\n\n\"With Trump, of course, it's going to benefit the wealthy the most, so as you go up, your paycheck will increase drastically, which would benefit him as well,\" Cole explained on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday.\n\nBut this comes at a cost -- a $9.5 trillion federal deficit over the next decade, which would require drastic reductions in federal spending to help pay for the tax breaks.\n\nRepublican rival Ted Cruz's tax plan would also result in an enormous federal deficit: an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Cruz's plan is the \"most creative,\" Cole said, and would reform the current 750,000-page tax code for a flat tax rate of 10 percent across all incomes.\n\nCruz's plan would also benefit the wealthy most, even more so than Trump's, Cole said. As for the middle class, paychecks may increase by about 50 dollars, according to the International Business Times analysis.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders would also raise the federal deficit with his tax plan, which Cole said was \"more extreme\" than Trump's. The senator vows to raise taxes regardless of your income, with the highest earners paying over 40 percent, for a \"trade off\" for funding free government programs, including college and health care.\n\n\"Unless you need health care, then Bernie Sanders is not going to do a lot for you,\" Cole said.\n\nBut if you want to keep things as they are, Cole said Clinton is your choice. Most Americans can expect the same taxes, and only those making over one million dollars would face an increase. For those making $5 million and over, Clinton plans to add a four percent surtax.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton is very status quo.

Those attacks, and one in Brussels four months ago, shocked Western Europe, already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration, open borders and pockets of Islamist radicalism.\n\nAuthorities are yet to produce evidence 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, shot dead by police, had any links to Islamic State, which claimed the attack, but Valls said there was no doubt on the assailant's motives.\n\n\"The investigation will establish the facts, but we know now that the killer was radicalised very quickly,\" Valls said in an interview with Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.\n\n\"The claim on Saturday morning by Islamic State and the fast radicalisation of the killer confirms the Islamist nature of this attack.\"\n\nOfficials said on Saturday that people questioned by police had indicated that he had undergone a rapid transformation from someone with no apparent interest in religion.\n\nRelatives and friends interviewed in Nice painted a picture of a man who at least until recently drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and according to French media even ate pork, behaviour that would be unlikely in a devout Muslim.\n\nSpeaking from his home town in Tunisia, Bouhlel's sister told Reuters he had been having psychological problems when he left for France in 2005 and had sought medical treatment.\n\nAs authorities were trying to better understand his motives, two more people, a man and a woman close to Bouhlel, were arrested in Nice early on Sunday, bringing the number of people in detention over the killings to seven.\n\nThe Amaq news agency affiliated with the militant Islamist group said that Bouhlel \"was one of the soldiers of Islamic State\".\n\nValls, who said security services had prevented 16 attacks over three years, indicated that at play on Thursday was the group's modus operandi of cajoling unstable individuals into carrying out attacks with whatever means possible.\n\n\"Daesh gives unstable individuals an ideological kit that allows them to make sense of their acts ... this is probably what happened in Nice's case,\" Valls said, referring to the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.\n\nThe group, which is under military pressure from forces opposed to it, considers France its main target given its military operations in the Middle East, and also because it is easier to strike than the United States, which is leading a coalition against it.\n\nDespite mounting criticism from the conservative opposition and far right over how President Francois Hollande's Socialist government is handling security, Valls said there was no risk zero and new attacks would occur.\n\n\"I've always said the truth regarding terrorism: there is an ongoing war, there will be more attacks. It's difficult to say, but other lives will be lost.\"\n\nWith presidential and parliamentary elections less than a year away, French opposition politicians are increasing pressure and seizing on what they described as security failings that made it possible for the truck to career 2km through large crowds before it was finally halted.\n\nAfter Thursday's attack, a state of emergency imposed across France after the November attacks in Paris was extended by three months.",

The magazine's recent championing of female architects, and highlighting of inequalities within the profession, is commendable. Among its findings was that the proportion of female architectural staff in the UK has actually declined since 2009, from 28% to 21% \u2013 this despite the proportion of female architecture students being roughly 50%. That work-life balance is evidently hard to strike in a profession many say is still inherently masculine, with its long apprenticeship, long working hours, and emphasis on competition rather than collaboration. No wonder they've called it the WAA \u2013 it sounds like a cry of despair, doesn't it?\n\nThe shortlists aren't too depressing, though. Eight women are up for the award, including Amanda Levete (formerly of Future Systems, doing well on her own), Roisin Heneghan (of Heneghan Peng, designers of the new London Olympics footbridge) and Sarah Wigglesworth (whose fine Sandal Magna primary school gained her a lot of attention last year). There's also an award for emerging woman architect of the year. The prizes are announced on 20 April. There's a nice (if confusingly Anglo-American) infographic on women in architecture here, by the way.\n\nThe woman for whom it has not been such a great week is the first female architect most people would name: Zaha Hadid. She's up for the WAA as well, but first she lost out on the competition to design the prestigious new Bauhaus Museum in Weimer, Germany, for which she was the only British architect in contention. Her absence was conspicuous, too, when it came to another architecture award: the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) announced the 23-strong shortlist for its inaugural national awards this week, and Zaha's Glasgow Riverside Museum for Transport isn't on it, despite being surely the highest-profile new building in Scotland of the past year. It wasn't a unanimously popular project, but its omission has baffled even its critics. Was it because Zaha has won the Stirling prize for two years running? Has she just become too big?\n\nHadid can at least take consolation from her inclusion in the V&A's new exhibition on British design, which opens today. The exhibition's architecture component includes a model of her Aquatics Centre, the only female-designed building in the show, as far as I could see. There are plenty of the usual architectural suspects here: the postwar Festival of Britain generation; Basil Spence; Denys Lasdun; big models of Foster's Gherkin and Rogers's Lloyds building.\n\nOne discovery for me was John Prizeman, about whom I'd known very little. He was an accomplished writer, and his work mainly focused on domestic interiors, particularly kitchens. There are illustrations of two small designs by him that caught my eye. One was his \"Soft-Tech House for the 1980s\" \u2013 an evocative, late-70s vision of \"the future\" that looks like a cross between Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House and a sort of Hobbit-style eco-dwelling. It's somehow simultaneously quaint and ahead of its time.\n\nThe other, particularly pertinent in the context of women in architecture, is a cutaway illustration of a neat, compact family home Prizeman designed in 1959. It's bracingly modern, with fitted kitchens, free-flowing living areas and a new Mini in the garage, though its name wasn't exactly progressive: it's called Her House. It says it all that the woman in Prizeman's dream home is depicted bustling around indoors; the man is lounging on the back terrace.\n\nFinally, another new discovery this week was Architects of Invention, a practice that not only has one of the best names in the business but looks to be living up to it. It is headed by Niko Japaridze, a former senior architect at Rem Koolhaas's OMA, who has worked in the UK and also has offices in his native Georgia. Last year, the firm wove a snaking wooden staircase through the new headquarters it designed for Georgia's National Olympic Committee, and has recently finished an imposing new building in Tbilisi with an imposing name: The Prosecutor's Office. It looks like a giant black filing cabinet, with square, glass rooms projecting out like half-opened drawers. Seventy per cent of the building is hung off the ground. The interior is just as startling \u2013 its long central staircase with green glass walls looks like something out of The Matrix. Japaridze has a host of other promising-looking buildings going up in Georgia. He also claims to be Tbilisi's one millionth citizen. One to watch.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2012.

        "text": "It\u2019s hard to remember a time when video games and comic books were enjoyed almost exclusively by people under the age of 18. But that was the case a mere couple of decades ago, before both began featuring violence, profanity, sex, and other material not appropriate for young children. Along the same lines, in recent times many other things long associated with kids are now being marketed to adult consumers. Here are a dozen examples:\n\nGummy Vitamins. A string of studies indicating that vitamins appear to be largely a waste of money has resulted in flat sales for the once sizzling vitamin market. It looks like consumers are getting the messages spread by researchers in the field, who point out that while vitamin supplements are correlated with better health, there is little proof of causality because the people taking vitamins tend to healthier and take better care of themselves in the first place. But if consumers are dubious about the benefits of boring old-fashioned vitamins, they appear less skeptical about vitamins \u201cdisguised as candy,\u201d a.k.a. gummy vitamins. Once popular only with children, colorful, chewable, sweet-tasting vitamins are now ubiquitous in stores\u2019 adult vitamin sections, and makers of such adult vitamins say that the category has been enjoying \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of late.\n\nWalt Disney World. In some ways, Disney World has always been marketed to adults\u2014who often say they enjoy \u201cfeeling like a kid\u201d while touring the theme parks sans children. Some even wish Disney would host child-free days when adults could hit the rides without having to deal with the young whippersnappers clogging up the parks. While that\u2019s highly unlikely to ever take place, Disney has taken several steps over the years to appeal to adult-only clientele, including the introduction of booze for sale at the Magic Kingdom, as well as special events like $35 \u201cAfter Hours\u201d party with alcohol and tasting menus, and, most recently, a $79 \u201cFood & Wine Late Night\u201d at EPCOT.\n\nPop Tarts. While interest in breakfast cereal has collapsed in recent years, sales of another kid favorite at the breakfast table, Pop Tarts, have risen each and every year for more than three decades straight. The Wall Street Journal noted that while Pop Tarts are most popular with teens and younger children, \u201cadults reach for them as a retro snack.\u201d It\u2019s not just nostalgia that\u2019s drawing adults to Pop Tarts, but that, \u201cShoppers increasingly want quick breakfasts they can eat with one hand on the go.\u201d Over the years, Pop Tarts and its imitators have periodically tried out products more directly marketed to adults and foodies, such as \u201cToaster Pastries\u201d in flavors like Cherry Pomegranate from Nature\u2019s Path.\n\nHappy Meals. McDonald\u2019s briefly tried to market a \u201cGo Active Happy Meal\u201d for adults a decade ago, with a salad and an exercise booklet instead of chicken nuggets and a plastic toy. It obviously didn\u2019t catch on\u2014very few healthy fast food items are successful\u2014but this fall, the Happy Meal for Adults concept is back, bizarrely, in the world of high fashion. Nordstrom is selling a series of pop culture-themed items from Moschino, including an iPhone case that looks like a McDonald\u2019s French fry container ($85) and a Happy Meal lookalike shoulder bag that retails for over $1,000.\n\nBackpacks. In what could be considered a sign that adults really don\u2019t want to grow up, backpack sales are up dramatically among consumers ages 18 and up\u2014including a 48% rise in backpack purchases by female adults over a recent time span. Valentino, Alexander McQueen, and Fendi are among the many fashion designers to feature posh leather and camouflage versions of the bag normally associated with high school and college kids, only theirs sometimes cost $2,000.\n\nLunchables. OK, so neither Kraft nor its Oscar Mayer brand actually markets Lunchables to adults. But the Adult Lunch Combos look eerily like Lunchables only without Oreos or Capri Sun, and everyone is referring to the new protein-packed prepared lunches as \u201cLunchables for Adults\u201d even though the real name is the Portable Protein Pack.\n\nObstacle Courses. Kids have playgrounds in town parks and schools. What do adults have to help keep them in shape while also having fun? The gym doesn\u2019t qualify because, for most people, working out is work, not fun. The exception is when the workout allows adults to swing, jump, get dirty, and challenge themselves on courses made specifically for them, like those on the popular TV show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d and on Tough Mudder and other extreme obstacle course races. This fall, Las Vegas is even hosting an \u201cAdult-Themed\u201d course where the obstacles have names like the Dominatrix Dungeon and the Blue Balls Dash.\n\nSugary Cereals. A big reason that cereal sales have dropped is that fewer kids are eating them for breakfast. Yet as parents try to sub in healthier fare as a replacement for kid-favorite sugary cereals, the cereal giants appear to be having some success reaching a different audience\u2014the parents themselves. Baby Boomers and Gen X, who grew up craving the sugar rush provided by a bowl of neon-colored goodies on Saturday mornings, are now being fed heaping doses of nostalgia, in the form of cartoon-character cereals brought back from the dead and other adult-focused marketing efforts. The fastest-growing consumers of Trix and Lucky Charms are, in fact, older adults.\n\nLegos. \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d was certainly clever and entertaining enough to warrant an adult audience, especially among those who grew up building with the bricks. Lately, Lego has been making another appeal to adults. Several Legoland Discovery Centers\u2014which normally attract families with children under the age of 10 or 12\u2014have been offering special Adult Nights, where all visitors must be 18 or over.\n\nFruit Roll-Ups. Many adults would probably be embarrassed if they were caught eating Fruit Roll-Ups, delicious though they may be. How can you avoid being kidded about your preference for what is a quintessential kid snack? Easy. Call them something more adult-sounding, such as Fruit Strips or Fruit Leather.\n\nHot Pockets. Last year, Nestle attempted to broaden the Hot Pocket demographic\u2014typically, teen boys and slacker college kids who don\u2019t want to cook or even order pizza\u2014by introducing gourmet versions featuring angus beef, hickory ham to appeal to adult foodies.\n\nHalloween. October 31 used to be about children trick-or-treating door to door in their neighborhoods. Now it\u2019s the centerpiece of a whole Halloween season where the kids are invited to enjoy only some\u2014but by no means all\u2014of the fun. A year ago, adults spent roughly $1.2 billion on costumes, compared to $1 billion spent on costumes for kids. Roughly 7 out of 10 college-aged adults plan on dressing up for Halloween, which explains the sales success of oddly \u201csexy\u201d costumes of pizza slices or corn fields. Or sexy nuns. Adults also tend to spend more on their costumes than they do on Halloween outfits for kids. So that explains why companies are marketing the holiday to adults more and more. Still, it\u2019s hard to come up with a good explanation for the existence of the Sexy Pizza Costume.",

        "text": "The Murdochs are still in crisis mode at Fox News. The network was rocked yet again on Friday, this time by a devastating article in New York magazine by Gabriel Sherman, who reported that Fox News paid a $3 million settlement to a booker who said Mr. Ailes carried on an abusive 20-year relationship with her \u2014 at times using company resources and personnel to facilitate it. Mr. Ailes denied the charges through his lawyer.\n\nIt immediately raised new questions about whether the Murdochs would be forced into a bigger house cleaning of Mr. Ailes\u2019s remaining team of lieutenants at Fox News, where, it seems, sexual harassment payouts were not followed by the recognition that there just might be a problem, let alone by any obvious attempts to aggressively address the corporate culture that facilitated the behavior in the first place.\n\nMr. Ailes\u2019s departure from the network leaves a huge vacuum in its own right. He drove it to pursue the stories that helped define the strife of the Clinton, Bush (No. 43) and Obama eras. He made it a TV headquarters for the patriotism-infused Bush war marketing effort; the false accusations that Mr. Obama was a \u201csocialist\u201d of dubious citizenship, and, most recently, the Trump movement.\n\nMr. Murdoch abided by it all, even when it conflicted with some of his own views, such as his support for a path to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants. But as often as not he seemed to be in line with Mr. Ailes, at least based on how he portrayed himself on Twitter \u2014 as a \u201cclimate change skeptic\u201d; as a fan of Dr. Ben Carson, \u201ca real black president who can properly address the racial divide\u201d; and as one who believes: \u201cMaybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.\u201d\n\nThough executives who have worked with Lachlan Murdoch say they assume he shares some of his father\u2019s conservatism, they also say he does not readily advertise his views, which is in itself a major departure from the elder Murdoch.\n\nAs for James Murdoch, his leanings are in plainer view than his brother\u2019s, and they are decidedly different from his father\u2019s (with an important exception, friends say: free-market fiscal policy).\n\nJames Murdoch\u2019s wife, Kathryn, is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund and a former director at the Clinton Climate Initiative. The couple started Quadrivium, a foundation that focuses on the \u201csustainable use of resources\u201d and \u201cscientific understanding.\u201d James has spearheaded initiatives to make the company \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d\n\nIn an essay in Time magazine in December, he wrote, \u201cEntrenched and compromised interests spin the fiction that science is more divided than united, and they sow seeds of uncertainty on issues of unquestionable priority: namely, the survival of our species on this planet.\u201d\n\nHis views have heartened producers and executives at National Geographic, which 21st Century Fox took greater control of last year.\n\nFox News\u2019s reporting often tells a much different story. Its hosts don\u2019t hesitate to report that \u201cthe science is still in question,\u201d as Heather Childers recently did, or that warnings about climate change are emanating from \u201cpeople aligned with the political left in the scientific community,\u201d as the host Steve Doocy said in April while promoting a film purporting to debunk climate change.\n\nEven before Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster, climate activists were hopeful that James Murdoch would force changes to skeptical coverage of climate change at Fox News, as well as its corporate cousin The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page has great sway with congressional Republicans.\n\nTo nudge it along, one group, Partnership for Responsible Growth, has run ads with both outlets reminding Republicans that their leaders used to support market-based solutions to climate change \u2014 and calling on The Journal\u2019s editorial page to acknowledge humankind\u2019s role.\n\nDavid Fenton, a longtime strategist for progressive causes whose agency, Fenton, made the ads, said its main goal was to push a bipartisan solution in the form of a carbon pricing system. The Murdoch outlets have been standing in the way, he said, by creating a \u201cfalse reality bubble denying science\u201d that scares amenable Republican politicians away from the cause.\n\n\u201cJames knows better, and there\u2019s no way that someone like that could be happy with the terribly negative role the Murdoch properties have played in slowing bipartisan action on climate,\u201d Mr. Fenton said.\n\nNone of the Murdochs would comment for this column.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to talk about the intersection of their political and business interests without lingering for a moment on the latter. Even if some of Fox News\u2019s programming drives one or both of the brothers bananas, it is still a major cash generator for 21st Century Fox, with $1.6 billion in operating profit in fiscal 2015, according to Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.\n\nFox News\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre was to fill a void that conservative-leaning viewers sensed in the mainstream media. That guiding philosophy has provided a steady compass, and a lucrative revenue stream, as its competitors have struggled with their own paths.\n\nThat could provide a strong argument against drastic change, especially for the elder Mr. Murdoch, who is by all accounts enjoying his new role running the network and is saying he won\u2019t rush into picking a successor to Mr. Ailes. It seems a near certainty that he will stay through the election.\n\nWith Mr. Murdoch at the helm, the network covered Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention in Philadelphia with all the skepticism you\u2019d expect. It didn\u2019t show the speech of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a fallen American soldier. Then, there was Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s aside that the slaves who built the White House, whom Michelle Obama referred to in her prime-time address, were \u201cwell fed\u201d and adequately housed.\n\nThat said, Fox News\u2019s audience tends to be older, which is why executives there indicate that the family views its younger prime-time star, Megyn Kelly, as an important part of its future. Her appeal extends to the core Fox News viewer as well as to those with more mainstream news tastes.\n\nMs. Kelly\u2019s contract, like Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, comes up for renewal next year. Before Mr. Ailes left, Ms. Kelly seemed certain to leave. Now it\u2019s a given that her decision will depend on how the Murdochs decide to proceed \u2014 as will so, so much else.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 1, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: With Ailes Out, and Murdoch In, What\u2019s Next at Fox News?.

        "text": "A couple of experts have just been on the radio warning against a dangerous growth in addictive behaviour among adults in western societies, much of it including internet gambling, porn and gaming, deliberately designed to be so. At the same time the Daily Beast is reporting excitedly that other experts are telling us not to drink more than three glasses of wine a week.\n\nYes, that's not a misprint. Clever chaps at Oxford University have concluded that the optimum intake of alcohol to dent booze-related deaths should be around 5g a day \u2013 that's slightly more than half a \"unit\" (8g) as currently defined, half of one (125ml) small scotch, half a half pint of beer, half a mean glass of red wine.\n\nMuddled messages here? You bet. The experts who complain about the commercial fostering of dirty habits are surely right. It's obvious to anyone who has watched a small child adeptly playing on an iPad, a teenager \u2013 including those of 35 \u2013 game-playing on a PC screen, let alone a harassed housewife getting past the chocolate and junk food in the queue for the supermarket till.\n\nBut half a glass of wine a day, what my father's generation would have dismissed as merely a dirty glass? As the saying goes, that sounds like a cure worse than the lurking diseases, public policy with little credibility which both contradicts other research that says that moderate drinking is good for most people \u2013 and undermines the Department of Health's (DH) official guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines have themselves been shrinking safe drinking for years. Twenty-eight units a week for men? Or 21? Twenty-one for women \u2013 or 14? The DH has changed its mind. What's more the number of units in a bottle of wine or scotch seems to be changing too. Ah well, say the puritans, the stuff's getting stronger. They say that about pot, too.\n\nTobacco? Well, that's more straightforward and is more a matter of liberty \u2013 the right to sell a legal (and tax-lucrative) substance using lawfully owned brand labels \u2013 than of health. Andrew Lansley is surely more right than wrong (I don't say this every week) to argue that alcohol, even crisps in moderation, are OK, but that in health terms the potential damage in tobacco always outweighs the pleasure of the drag.\n\nBy coincidence, the papers also contain warnings from the Health Protection Agency that sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise again among those young people not totally addicted to Grand Theft Auto. Charities rush to blame government cuts in the health education budget \u2013 they would, wouldn't they? \u2013 though it's not father-of-five Lansley who is not taking the precautions that put young people at risk. It's the young people \u2013 and we all remember why. It didn't seem important at the time.\n\nThe cost of all these bad lifestyle choices is considerable, both in terms of the battered NHS budget and the misery it causes, ill-health, premature death, infertility, domestic violence. Yet we struggle to get a handle on it. On one page of the Daily Beast, people who should know better complain that the nanny state interferes too much in our lives, on the next it demands more intervention to protect us from risks that most adults should be sensible enough to evaluate without having to be told.\n\nThe struggle between liberty and 'elf 'n' safety is beautifully illustrated by Thursday's Guardian report about the German climber on Everest who took that now-famous shot of the traffic jam of those mostly romantic amateurs (one carrying his bike) queuing to try to climb the world's highest mountain. Some will die, he thought sadly, and four later did. Lethal places mountains, even for the experts.\n\nYet the German climber, Ralf Dujmovits, encountered what he called \"an overweight French journalist\" \u2013 a woman weighing 80kg \u2013 who had used up all her oxygen long before she had reached the point where a proper climber would need it. Who let her climb? Who sold her the oxygen? It's not a self-regarding action that merely puts her own life at risk. Mountains aren't like that. Climbers are roped.\n\nFast-forward to the Oxford report. Yes, we know that booze can kill and maim. We can see that every day \u2013 though in Fleet Street and Westminster I see rather less of it than I once did and admit to slightly mixed feelings: it was so much more fun in the old days before the new puritanism took hold, a puritanism that is, incidentally, hedonistic in its own way.\n\nBut I can't believe any good is served for scientists to step in at a time when governments in London and Edinburgh are grappling with the most effective model of unit pricing (how to target the winos' tipple without being unfair to the sober poor) and suggest that virtual teetotalism is the answer. It just defies belief and as such is bad policy. My oldest friend still drinks four or five proper units a day every day \u2013 and he's pushing 85.",

        "text": "DALLAS -- The day after five Dallas officers were killed by a sniper, the city\u2019s police chief described the men as \u201cguardians\u201d of democracy, praising them for protecting the freedom to protest at a large demonstration against police brutality.\n\nPresident Barack Obama later eulogized the slain officers, saying they died while defending essential constitutional rights.\n\nBut nearly two months after the shootings, Dallas police have moved to silence critics and squelch lingering questions about the attack. Officers in riot gear have been told to ticket protesters who block or disrupt traffic, and Police Chief David Brown has refused to meet with demonstrators unless they agree to end their marches through downtown, which he says pose a threat to officers.\n\nAuthorities have also refused to release even the most basic information about the slayings, including any details about the weapons used, the autopsy findings and ballistics tests that could establish whether any officers were hit by friendly fire. Police have indicated that such information could be withheld almost indefinitely.\n\nIn addition, the police department\u2019s most vocal, visible critic -- a 27-year-old self-styled preacher with a criminal history -- has been arrested multiple times in the last month on warrants that include unpaid traffic tickets and attempts to revoke his probation from a 2009 felony. On Friday, Dominique Alexander was ordered to prison.\n\n\u201cWhy all of a sudden are we the target?\u201d asked Damon Crenshaw, vice president of the Next Generation Action Network, which organized the July 7 protest. \u201cWe\u2019re not protesting because we\u2019re mad at them. We\u2019re protesting because the problems still exist and they won\u2019t talk to us.\u201d\n\nCrenshaw said Alexander was targeted because of his protest activities and that the shooter, Micah Johnson, was not affiliated with their group.\n\nDallas has a history of cracking down on protesters.\n\nDuring the Occupy Dallas demonstrations in 2011, the city tried to require protesters to have a $1 million insurance policy, strengthened rules against camping in the city and eventually evicted campers from City Hall in a midnight police raid.\n\nIn 2013, the city cited a decades-old rule prohibiting holding signs within 75 feet of major roadways to stop a group that planned to protest the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. The city settled a lawsuit from that group before changing the law to prohibit protests on overpasses and other areas near highways. Another group sued over that law leading to another settlement, and the city repealed the rules all together.\n\nAlexander, the founder of the protest network, believes he was targeted because he refused to stop the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThey try to hush and silence people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a failure to the lives lost if we don\u2019t continue. The issues still exist, and they can act like they want to heal, but then they ignore the issues.\u201d\n\nThe police chief has support from City Hall. Mayor Mike Rawlings said in a statement that he trusts Brown\u2019s \u201cjudgment in how he communicates with protest organizers.\u201d\n\nAlexander, whose record includes convictions for forging a check, evading police and theft, was on probation for a 2009 conviction for causing injury to a child. He said the 2-year-old he was watching had fallen off the couch, but hospital staff said the child\u2019s injuries were more consistent with abuse.\n\nAlexander denied injuring the child and said he pleaded guilty because he could not afford a good attorney.\n\nHis uncle was killed by police in 2010 after firing on officers. But it was the 2014 death of a woman he knew in high school that prompted his involvement in police protests, Alexander said. The woman was missing for a week before being found dead in an abandoned building. Her family complained that police ignored their initial pleas for help.\n\nAlexander spent the past two weeks under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor and awaiting a judge\u2019s determination of whether his probation would be revoked.\n\n\u201cNo new crime has been committed to warrant this kind of action,\u201d said Kim Cole, one of Alexander\u2019s attorneys. \u201cAnd the timing does appear suspicious.\u201d\n\nJust days after a July 29 silent protest -- the first following the sniper attack -- authorities asked that Alexander\u2019s probation be revoked for a variety of violations, including twice leaving the state without notifying his probation officer, once to attend the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Court records show the judge admonished Alexander and added 30 hours of community service to his sentence.\n\nThen on Aug. 10, following a confrontational appearance at a city council meeting, Alexander was cited for trespassing and escorted out of City Hall, where officers were waiting to arrest him on nine outstanding traffic ticket warrants. He spent the night in jail and, within an hour of his release, another arrest warrant was issued in a new attempt to revoke probation. That request rehashed clprevious allegations from the past year, including missed meetings with his probation officer, for which Alexander had already served 10 days in jail in December.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s hearing, the judge considered all of Alexander\u2019s probation violations and sent him to prison for two years. With credit for time served, that comes to about six months, his attorneys said.\n\nProsecutor Douglas Millican denied that politics were behind the efforts to revoke Alexander\u2019s probation. But Cole said Alexander got extra scrutiny because of his protest activities, noting that police and sheriff\u2019s officers had provided the judge with social media posts and other photos and video of Alexander to show he had left the state.\n\nIn addition to the protest crackdowns, city and police officials have also succeeded in suppressing questions about the shooting, including details about the law enforcement response and the motive of the gunman, who was killed when police deployed a bomb-carrying robot. It was the first time law enforcement in the U.S. had used a robot to deliver and detonate an explosive to kill a suspect.\n\nAuthorities have refused public records requests for police reports, 911 calls, audio and video recordings, autopsy documents, crime scene photos and evidence gathered at Johnson\u2019s house, which police initially said held an arsenal of weapons and bomb-making material and a journal of combat tactics possibly indicating plans for a larger attack. Other officials have told The Associated Press that Johnson did not have a large stockpile of bomb-making materials.\n\nThe Associated Press was informed by Dallas police late Friday that a portion of the records it requested would be made available, but the content was unclear.\n\nBrown told the City Council earlier this month that much of the information about the attack could be withheld for an indefinite period during an investigation into whether the use of force was justified. He declined to estimate how long that investigation might take, but said his office\u2019s findings would be reviewed by the district attorney and a grand jury.\n\nThe police chief did acquiesce to one of the protest network\u2019s top demands, agreeing to eliminate a 2013 policy allowing officers 72 hours to give a statement after being involved in a shooting. The move, announced in a nighttime post to the department\u2019s blog, said officers \u201cwill be provided the same legal rights as any other citizen who is the subject of a criminal investigation.\u201d",

Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express have \"zero liability\" policies, so you'll never lose a penny to credit card fraud.\n\n(Read more: 4 tips for avoiding holiday-related identity theft)\n\nWith debit cards, your maximum liability is $50, if you notify the bank within two days. After that it jumps to $500. You could lose all the money thatwas stolen from your checking account if you fail to report the fraud within 60 days of getting your bank statement.\n\nVisa and MasterCard promise \"zero liability\" on the debit card transactions they handle if the customer chooses to sign for the transaction rather than use a PIN. Even so, the missing money doesn't go back into your account instantaneously.\n\n\"Your money could be legally missing from your account for as much as two weeks while the bank investigates and decides whether to reimburse you,\" noted Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the advocacy group U.S. PIRG. \"During that time you may not be able to pay your rent or mortgage or buy anything with your debit card.\"\n\nSo why have a debit card? Some people don't qualify for a credit card. Others use them to stick to their budget, since you can't spend more than you have in your checking account.\n\n\"Debit cards are fine, right up to the point where they get stolen, and then they're no longer fine,\" Ulzheimer said. \"In my mind, if you qualify for a credit card and have the willpower not to run up a massive amount of credit card debt, then credit cards are a safer alternative.\"\n\nNote: After the Target breach, a few banks took the unprecedented step of limiting how much customers could spend at stores or withdraw from ATMs using their debit cards. No such restrictions were put on credit card customers.\n\n2. Free credit monitoring is nice, but it won't protect Target victims\n\nWe've come to expect free credit after a breach. It's a way for the company to show they care about us.\n\nCredit monitoring can be a useful fraud-fighting tool if someone steals your identifying information, such as date of birth, account passwords or Social Security numbers. That did not happen in this case.\n\n(Read more: Chart of the Day: Target's image takes a beating)\n\n\"To be honest with you, it's worthless in this situation,\" Pascual said. \"I think it created a false sense of security, which is unfair and probably wasn't the best way to go about helping people.\"\n\nThat's because the fraudulent use of your credit card does not trigger an alert on your credit report. And debit card transactions aren't even reported to the credit bureaus.\n\n3. A security freeze won't protect you in this sort of breach\n\nA lot of \"experts\" advised victims of the Target breach to put a security freeze on their credit report.\n\nWhen Social Security numbers are stolen, a credit freeze is the smart thing to do. It prevents an identity thief from opening new accounts in your name. But that did not happen in this case.\n\n\"A security freeze doesn't make any sense as a way to respond to this data breach,\" said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). \"That's something you typically do after you spot obvious signs of financial fraud.\"\n\nA freeze prevents lenders from accessing your credit report to process a new loan or credit card application. It does not prevent fraud on an existing account. It will not stop a crook from using a stolen account number to shop online or clone a new debit or credit card to use at the store.\n\nA credit freeze is a smart thing to do when Social Security numbers are stolen because it prevents a thief from opening new accounts in your name.\n\n4. Should you change the PIN number on your debit card?\n\nTarget confirmed Friday that encrypted PINs were stolen in the breach, though it said the \"key\" necessary to decrypt data is not within its system and could not have been taken during the breach.\n\nChanging your PIN will prevent a stolen debit card number from being used to withdraw cash at an ATM, but it won't stop a crook from using it to buy things. Debit cards can be used without a PIN at most stores.\n\nTo be completely safe, you'll need to ask the bank to issue you a new card number.\n\n5. Is it safer to choose \"credit\" over \"debit\" when you use a debit card?\n\nWhen you swipe your debit card, you're asked to choose \"debit\" or \"credit.\" I've heard it suggested that if you hit \"credit\" you are then making a credit card transaction. That's not true.\n\n\"There is nothing you can do to turn that debit card into a credit card, even if the card has the Visa or MasterCard logo on it,\" said Bill Hardekopf, CEO and founder of LowCards.com.\n\nWhat you are doing is choosing how that transaction is processed. Does it require a PIN or just a signature to pull that money out of your checking account?\n\n\"You're just as vulnerable to a hacker,\" said Brian Krebs, who broke the Target breach story on his KrebsOnSecurity blog. \"Nothing magically happens if you push credit instead of debit that makes it any harder for someone to steal your card information. It's all still ones and zeros on a magnetic strip.\"\n\nDebit cards are not going to go away. People like them. Banks encourage us to use them.\n\nConsumer groups want Congress to guarantee more fraud protection for debit cardholders.\n\n\"We would like to see the liability for debit cards capped at $50\u2014just like credit cards,\" said Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at the advocacy group Consumer Action. \"We'd like to see a higher standard of protection for debit cards enshrined in law, not just in the voluntary 'zero liability' programs offered by card issuers.\"\n\nThe nation's bankers oppose any change in the law. And quite frankly, it's unlikely Congress will do anything. That means you need to take steps to protect yourself.\n\nBest practices for anyone with a credit or debit card\n\nThe best way to take responsibility for your financial security is to go online a couple of times a month to check your credit card and checking account statement. Look for any unauthorized charges and report them right away. Don't wait for your end of the month statement.\n\nTake advantage of financial alerts, if available, on your accounts that can give you a heads-up to a possible problem.\n\n(Read more: Banks could sue over Target card data breach)\n\nIf you get a notification in the mail that your debit or credit card accounts have been breached, respond immediately, because the risk is real. Javelin's data show that people who were notified of a card breach this past year had a 28 percent chance of being the victim of card fraud.\n\nBeware of email alerts that ask you to provide your personal information. Target is not doing this, and no company would. These bogus alerts are from identity thieves.\n\n\"These attacks are affecting retailers of all sizes, and they are going to continue to happen,\" Pascual said. \"Consumers need to remain vigilant and take advantage of any opportunity they have to monitor their accounts and protect themselves.\"\n\n\u2014By CNBC contributor Herb Weisbaum.

It fuels the world\u2019s workforce, with more than 1.3bn cups consumed around the world every day according to coffee researchers Allegra Strategies.\n\nMore than 1.3bn cups are consumed around the world every day\n\nYet unlike wine sommeliers, the baristas making and serving your skinny, frothy, cappuccino or latte haven\u2019t always been taken seriously. Working in the coffee industry has been thought of as an in-between job, something you\u2019d do to get you through college or help bolster the sporadic income from an acting career. For decades, working in coffee was a stopgap on the way to another, more important career goal. Things however are changing.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge business - Allegra has calculated that cups drunk out of the home account for sales of around $60bn -$80bn per year globally and the coffee industry is now considered a viable career option in itself. Speciality coffee shops employ workers who are passionate about their trade and see it as an end in itself, not a route to their dream career. Poke your head into a fancy coffee joint in New York, Sydney or Singapore and the chances are you\u2019ll be served by someone who waxes lyrical about their latest beans in the same way as a craft brewer eulogises on a favourite ale.\n\nYou\u2019ll be served by someone who waxes lyrical about their latest beans\n\nYou won\u2019t be earning an investment banker\u2019s salary. In 2014 the Speciality Coffee Association of America found that, on average, baristas in speciality coffee shops in the US earned $22,000 a year basic salary. With an industry certification this salary rose to $24,500. Make the next step to become a roaster and you can expect on average $38,000, rising to nearly $40,000 with a certification. Baristas can also use their expertise to get a well-paid job in equipment sales and product sourcing.\n\nGlobally there are 40,000 professional baristas according to coffee research specialists, Allegra Strategies. Throw senior chain store baristas and senior brewers into the mix and the number swells to 200,000 in the US alone. Big chains such as Starbucks still account for the majority of coffee shops \u2013 a staggering 45,000 worldwide including 22,000 outlets but there are a sizeable number of independents; around 1,200 in the US and 450 in the UK.\n\nLondon, for its part, is an independent coffee shop hot spot. In the heart of Fitzrovia, a trendy, enclave north of the frenetic hub, Oxford Street is a plethora of high-end joints so certain of their value to espresso drinkers that the presence of coffee behemoths seemingly on every street corner, doesn\u2019t worry them.\n\n\u201cIf a rival opens five doors down, it makes us focus even more on what we offer,\u201d said Peter Dore-Smith, owner of coffee shop, Kaffeine. \u201cWe need to make sure our coffee, our food, our service, our atmosphere make our place somewhere people want to hang out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that go-getting attitude that marks out small independent outlets as the industry pioneers. Among the big drivers of the rise of \u2018barista craft\u2019 worldwide are international coffee competitions. In 2000 the inaugural World Barista Championships were held in Monte Carlo and since then it\u2019s spawned a host of other events globally.\n\nGareth Jones is the manager of the Fitzrovia branch of Workshop Coffee, a small chain. He takes his job and the chance to show off his skills in competitions, very seriously. But whilst winning is a bonus, the taking part is, in some ways, more important\n\n\u201cBaristas from around the world can get together, discuss ideas and move the industry forward. Competitions push you to improve, raise the quality and focus on the finer details.\u201d\n\nTaking the job seriously also brings financial rewards. Gareth earns around \u00a325,000 ($37,000) a year and down the road, Claire Brice manager of Kaffeine boasts a salary of \u00a332,000 ($48,000). Winning one of the big competitions can also mean thousands of dollars in equipment, trips abroad and of course the prestige of being the best.\n\nIt\u2019s this change in attitude and expectation which has helped elevate the barista trade from a fill-in job for college students to a caffeine-fuelled career.\n\nDo you have what it takes to be a coffee hot shot?

        "text": "To some, he is verging on a saint and martyr, singlehandedly standing against the forces of Chinese political repression. For others he is a canny manipulator, utterly in control of his reputation and place in the art world and market. For others still, he is all these things: an artist who outdoes even Andy Warhol in his ubiquity, his nimbleness at self-promotion and his use of every medium at his disposal to promulgate his work and his activism.\n\nWhatever your views on the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, one thing is clear: he is everywhere, from the Hampstead theatre in London, where Howard Brenton's play about the 81 days Ai spent in detention in 2011 is underway, to the web, where his the video for his heavy metal song Dumbass is circulating, to the Venice Biennale, where not one but three of his large-scale works are on display \u2013 perhaps the most exposure for any single artist at the international festival.\n\nOne of the works, Bang, a forest of hundreds of tangled wooden stools, is the most prominent piece in the German national pavilion. Then, in the Zuecca Project Space on the island of Giudecca, is his installation Straight: 150 tons of crushed rebar from schools flattened in the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, recovered by the artist and his team, who bought the crumpled steel rods as scrap before painstakingly straightening them and piling them up in a wave-like sculptural arrangement.\n\nBy far the most revealing about Ai's own experience, though, is the third piece, SACRED. Situated in the church of Sant'Antonin, it consists of six large iron boxes, into which visitors can peek to see sculptures recreating scenes from the artist's detention. Here is a miniature Ai being interrogated; here a miniature Ai showers or sits on the lavatory while two uniformed guards stand over him. Other scenes show him sleeping and eating \u2013 always in the same tiny space, always under double guard. (The music video refers to some of these scenes with a lightly satirical tone that is absent from the sculpture.)\n\nAccording to Greg Hilty of London's Lisson Gallery, under whose auspices SACRED is being shown, and who saw Ai in China a week ago, the work is a form of \"therapy or exorcism \u2013 it was something he had to get out. It is an experience that we might see as newsworthy, but for him, he was the one in it.\"\n\nThe uncanny hyperreality of the installation speaks of the fact that, according to the project's curator, Maurizio Bortolotti, \"the experience made him fix all the details like a nightmare\". For 81 days, said Hilty, he had nothing to do (aside from his periods being questioned) but memorise the minutest details of the tiny, featureless room in which he was kept. The outside of the metal boxes is entirely blank \u2013 Ai was brought there hooded. The only detail of the cell's exterior he observed was on his release, when he saw the number on the door: 1135.\n\nThe ecclesiastical setting, the title of the work, the appearance of the metal crates (which might resemble a reliquary or saint's coffin) suggest that Ai is positioning himself as a martyr. According to Hilty, however, \"He is not pretending to be a saint, but the setting does suggest things such as the stations of the cross, or the temptations of St Anthony, to whom the church is dedicated. But these are human, universal things that go beyond Ai Weiwei \u2026 he's not saying he's a saint, or that he is wholly right or good. He's just being honest.\n\n\"There is a reflex among artworld people that if he is strong as an activist you can't see him as an artist,\" Hilty added. \"But Ai shows a remarkable knack for working in different registers.\" The sculpture at the Venice Biennale should be seen as entirely different from the pop video, the blogging, the activism and the rest, Hilty suggested. \"He could be dismissed as a polemicist, an activist. But I hope people see these works and recognise that he can do all that and also step back and make art with profundity.\"",

A group of these vulnerable Democratic senators recently signed a letter to embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asking that the March 31st open enrollment deadline for Obamacare get pushed back.\n\nRepublicans in the House, meanwhile, may seek to increase the pressure this week by again voting to delay the mandate for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Calls for an individual mandate delay, fiercely opposed by the administration, will likely becoming overwhelming if the federal website is not functioning seamlessly by Dec. 1. Even if the mandate is delayed, the millions of young, healthy and currently uninsured people the law depends on to make the economics work could ultimately decide paying the penalty is better than buying insurance. That could spark a \"death spiral\" for the law, an outcome that would be devastating for the Obama presidency and Democrats hopes in 2014 and beyond.\n\nThe hearings begin on Tuesday but the main event comes Wednesday when Sebelius squares off against Republicans at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing. Obama speaks on the health care law the same day at Faneuil Hall in Boston, the place then-Gov. Mitt Romney in 2006 signed the Massachusetts law cited as the model for Obamacare.\n\nALSO IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEK \u2013 The House-Senate budget conference begins Wednesday at 10 a.m. EDT with a meeting that should be little more than a photo-op and a chance for the 29 members to speechify on their priorities.

The suspension also covers the postseason.\n\nRodriguez originally received a 211-game suspension from MLB in August due to his alleged ties to Biogenesis, an anti-aging clinic in South Florida which supplied performance-enhancing drugs. A number of high-profile players were suspended for their involvement in the scandal, including Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz, and Jhonny Peralta, but Rodriguez received the biggest penalty of them all, allegedly for interfering with MLB's investigation.\n\n(Read more: Elite athletes born all 'roided up: Data on books)\n\nWhile the other players connected to Biogenesis immediately accepted their suspensions, Rodriguez appealed and was able to finish out the season. Following a contentious arbitration process, Horowitz did not uphold the original ban, but this should be considered a major victory for MLB and commissioner Bud Selig. It is still the longest suspension under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention & Treatment Program. Guillermo Mota previously received a 100-game suspension in 2012.\n\nThe other big winner today, at least from a financial perspective, is the Yankees, who will no longer have Rodriguez's salary ($25 million) on the books for the 2014 season.

This injustice is MLB's first step toward abolishing guaranteed contracts in the 2016 bargaining round, instituting lifetime bans for single violations of drug policy, and further insulating its corrupt investigative program from any variety defense by accused players, or any variety of objective review.\n\nI have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I will take this fight to federal court. I am confident that when a Federal Judge reviews the entirety of the record, the hearsay testimony of a criminal whose own records demonstrate that he dealt drugs to minors, and the lack of credible evidence put forth by MLB, that the judge will find that the panel blatantly disregarded the law and facts, and will overturn the suspension. No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with, and I am exhausting all options to ensure not only that I get justice, but that players' contracts and rights are protected through the next round of bargaining, and that the MLB investigation and arbitration process cannot be used against others in the future the way it is currently being used to unjustly punish me.",

        "text": "The historical stereotype of prosthetic limbs is of military men - or pirates - stomping along on a peg leg or threatening people with a hook where their hand used to be. But prosthetics have a venerable history going back thousands of years \u2013 and the two earliest examples involved women.\n\nThe first record of a prosthetic limb is in a Sanskrit holy book from India written sometime between 3500 and 1800 BC, which relates how the warrior Queen Vishpla was fitted with an iron leg to replace one lost in battle. While Vishpla's leg has never been found, alas, archaeologists digging in Egypt in 2000 unearthed an artificial big toe estimated to be 3000 years old, attached to the mummy of a woman. The prosthetic toe showed a remarkable degree of sophistication, with three bendable joints. Wear and tear showed it had been used extensively during the woman's lifetime.\n\nIt wasn't until the 16th century that further major advances were made, when French surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 created prosthetics including mechanical hinged hands and locking knee joints which could be used to at least partially aid ordinary daily activities. But even though demand for prosthetics rose \u2013 generally driven by war - not much changed greatly in general appearance or function until after WW2.\n\nThe use of new materials such as plastic has today been superseded by prosthetics with a far more naturalistic appearance. \u201cCustomised silicone covers are available that match the amputee\u2019s sound limb in size, colour, shape and texture. This includes freckles, hairs and even creases in the joints,\u201d says Abdo Haidar, director at The London Prosthetic Centre.\n\nThe advent of computer aided design and better production processes has also made prosthetic limbs far more functional. Motorisation has also developed significantly. In 2007, UK researchers created a highly flexible motorised ankle which combined sensors to detect minute movements with micro-motors to adjust the ankle in response to uneven surfaces. This provided users with far more normal gait and greater stability.\n\nAbdo Haidar sees developments in the next decade focusing on the increasing blending of human and machine to boost senses of feeling plus mind control. \u201cMicroprocessors will improve at a much faster rate, while another advancing technology is osseointegration, which involves inserting an implant - accepted by the body as part of the bone - that allows artificial limbs and body parts to be permanently attached to it.\u201d\n\nBoosting sensations is a key area. In 2015, for example, Austrian scientists created an artificial leg which allowed the amputee to feel lifelike sensations from their prosthetic foot via sensors which measured pressures at the heel, toes and sole. Signals were relayed through the limb to sensors connected to the base of the stump, stimulating the nerve endings to relay signals to the brain.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago has been a pioneer of such 'bionic' prosthetics, including legs able to climb stairs with the minimum of fuss - not so easy for an artificial limb. Sensors detect speed changes, orientation and weight, feeding the data to built-in computer chips that guide the leg to respond to differences in terrain. The sensors in the prosthetic limb 'talk' to the patient's body via links to nerves in their thigh.\n\nLast year, meanwhile, engineers at John Hopkins University unveiled a robotic arm with 26 joints, capable of curling up to 45 pounds - and a modular construction allowing it to be taken apart and adapted in myriad ways to suit the needs of different people.\n\nThis Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) is also controlled by the user's mind via connections between over 100 sensors in the limb to nerves in the stump. Talking to the New York Times last year, chief engineer Mike McLoughlin revealed that as the remapped nerves grew through use, users were able to feel increasing sensation in the limb - to the point of detecting differences in texture.\n\nBritish researchers have led the way in bionic hands, beginning in the early 1960s with efforts at Edinburgh's Princess Margaret Rose Hospital to find prosthetic solutions for children affected by birth deformities caused by the drug Thalidomide. The hospital's Bioengineering Centre has became a global leader, with successes including the world's first electrically-powered shoulder in 1998.\n\nMaking high-tech prosthetics accessible... and affordable\n\nOlder readers may recall a 1970s series called The Six Million Dollar Man, where hero Steve Austin was 'rebuilt' into a bionic dude who used his super-charged skills at running or fighting to deal with bad folk every week. Putting a figure in the title flags up the very real issue of cost when it comes to bionic advances.\n\nTake the John Hopkins modular arm, which presently comes in at a whopping $500,000 each \u2013 a figure even its maker admits he would like to see come down to a tenth of that amount at least. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed a Maserati here, but what most people will want is a good Toyota,\u201d Mike McLoughlin told the New York Times last year.\n\n3-D printing may be one way to slash costs for basic prosthetic limbs. A basic arm with very minimal functions can already be printed for around $50, for example \u2013 albeit more for appearance than key day-to-day use. However, exiii Inc. is a recently-founded Japanese robotics company specializing in bionic arms, coming up with a 3-D printed limb called the handiii that comes in at under $5000.\n\nIts greatest success has arguably been the i-limb (nothing at all to do with Apple!). Brought to the market in 2007 via a company called Touch Bionics, the i-limb is a hand with five highly flexible digits, plus lifelike artificial skin. Refined over the years, the latest version \u2013 the i-limb quantum \u2013 includes customisable grips, a slim anatomically-correct design and a robust aluminium structure.\n\nIt also features a high level of digital control using software dubbed a biosim, allowing wearers to control hand movements via Bluetooth. More intuitive apps were added last year, while the hand itself was given 30% greater digit speed and strength. Over 200 people now have i-limb hands.\n\nAn artificial hand developed at John Hopkins, meanwhile, uses pressure sensors in the fingers wired to nerves in the upper arm to allows users to 'feel' the shape of objects, and also if they are hard or soft. Such improved sensory feedback offers more than a psychological boost. Users have found they can use the new sensations to greatly improve their control of the prosthetic hand - to the point of being able to pick the stem off a cherry!\n\nThe process by which prosthetics get 'thought control' is fairly straightforward in concept \u2013 but requires delicate surgery. Todd Kuiken at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago pioneered a key process a decade ago, called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR).\n\nThis uses the residual nerves from the amputated limb and transfers their links to alternative muscle groups. Computer chips inside the prosthetic are then connected to sensors that pick up motor signals from nerves in a patient's stump that formerly commanded limb movements, such as a hand opening or a knee bending. Because muscles are electrically active, they act as amplifiers for the nerve signals, strengthening them enough for the prosthetic sensors to pick them up and send them to motors that move the relevant bits of the artificial limb.\n\n\u201cAll of the direct neural-machine interfaces that connect to the peripheral nerves - outside of the brain and spinal cord - require surgical intervention,\u201d says Paul Marasco, a neuroscientist at the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute and leading prosthetics researcher. \u201cThese include placing different types of electrodes on or in the nerves, such as electrodes that are threaded in with a needle along the length of a nerve. The end-goals are to build a way to communicate with the nerve signals and the brain through normal channels. We can get people to view the limb as if it actually belongs to them.\u201d\n\nInitially, these signals could only be interpreted one at a time e.g. turn wrist, then open hand \u2013 resulting in motions that appeared robotic compared with the natural fluidity of the normal motion. However, more refined computer algorithms in the sensors now allow them to recognise patterns of movement to make things flow more naturally.\n\n\u201cThe long-term goal for all of this work is to have non-invasive ways to control a dexterous robotic device - no extra surgeries, no extra implants, said Robert Armiger, project manager for amputee research at the Johns Hopkins lab, speaking to the New York Times last year. His vision for the future is for limb users to be able to slip on a cap with sensors that would beam information from the brain to the prosthetic limb.\n\nToday's researchers have their hands \u2013 natural and bionic - full just getting prosthetics to mimic everyday activities. \u201cWe are still working on the basic processes of walking on inclines or stairs, and dressing, eating, and hygiene,\u201d admits Paul Marasco.\n\nThere are some more futuristic developments in the pipeline, however. The company Second Sight are behind one of the most exciting. Their Argus II is a visual prosthetic device that sits on top of the retina and links wirelessly to special glasses that can bypass damaged parts of the eye and send visual signals straight to the brain. The promise here is the ability to restore sight to a blind person in a similar way to the visors worn by the Jordy character in Star Trek: Next Generation. And that is a wonderful vision.",

Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat advice would you give your 22-year-old self today?\u201d is written by Michael Leabman, founder and CTO of Energous.\n\nLet me start out by saying I have a lot of advice for my 22-year-old self. But the most important parts are actually the same pieces of advice that I would give to anyone starting out\u2013whether that\u2019s a young entrepreneur or my own kids. For me, these life lessons translated into the achievement of a dream\u2013cheesy, but true: the creation of my own company. Here\u2019s to hoping they are valuable to others as well.\n\nMake your parents nervous It\u2019s never too early to follow your dreams. Over the years, I realized that my biggest mistakes were the result of not following my instincts or taking enough risks. It wasn\u2019t until I turned 30 that I started pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and consciously taking more chances. Early on, one of the biggest deliberate risks was trading in a stable position for a $0 salary. I wish I could say that everyone was supportive, and while my parents were, others said it would be impossible. In the end, following my gut led me to where I am today.\n\nSurround yourself with smart people You don\u2019t need to have all the answers to accomplish your end goal\u2013all you need to have is the vision and the passion to seek out the unknown. Whether it\u2019s family, friends, a business partner, or mentor (both personal and professional), surround yourself with people who can act as a sounding board or share valuable insights into challenging areas that you might not have expertise in. These people can help guide your ideas and provide support at various levels, which can prove tremendously valuable.\n\nKnow when to stop listening and follow your heart While it\u2019s helpful, and even critical, to subject yourself and your idea to the opinions and recommendations of other smart people, it\u2019s important to take all advice with a grain of salt. Consider, for example, if the person is truly staying within the bounds of their expertise, or if they have perhaps tried and failed at your vision using another approach. Challenges will happen frequently and you will cross paths with people who are non-believers, but doing something that you are passionate about makes it much easier to overcome obstacles you encounter along the way. For me, this advantage naturally pushes me towards solving a problem, as opposed to letting it upset me. I am thankful that I wake up every day and work on my dream.\n\nLearn from your experiences Last but not least, and one of the most valuable pieces of advice I can give is to realize that your first endeavor might not be successful\u2013and accept that from the beginning. Deliberately choosing to take more risks means you are also acknowledging that failure is a possibility, but realizing that without taking the risk you won\u2019t reap the benefits. The trick is to also commit to learning from your mistakes. For me, each career move is a stepping stone to something better. From your first job to your dream job and everything in between, there\u2019s value to be gained at every level, so embrace the small things and don\u2019t be afraid to push yourself outside of your comfort zone. You have everything to gain.",

        "text": "There is no question the United States has achieved a moral victory by finding and killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. More practically, the implications relating to geopolitical risk are much less certain. While some would argue that killing the head of al Qaeda is a positive development, there is also a credible case to be made that this action could potentially accelerate terrorist activity if bin Laden is perceived as a martyr by his brethren.\n\nIn assessing the impact of the death of bin Laden, it is important to note that he has been on the run from U.S. Special Forces for almost a decade. While figuratively bin Laden remained the head of al Qaeda, there is no doubt that being on the run reduced his effectiveness from an operational leadership perspective. With the entire CIA looking for him and a massive award on his head, bin Laden realistically didn\u2019t have the capability to micro manage al Qaeda operations. Therefore it is unlikely that the killing of bin Laden will dramatically reduce the threat from al Qaeda in the short term.\n\nStepping back for a moment, it is also important to note that the very nature and organization of al Qaeda remains very much in question. There are some analysts that question whether al Qaeda is as organized as is often portrayed by the press. In fact, as Marc Sagemen, a former CIA agent based in Islamabad, and author of Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, wrote:\n\n\u201cThere is no umbrella organization. We like to create a mythical entity called al-Qaeda in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with.\u201d\n\nThis is a controversial position and is widely disputed, but the reality is that al Qaeda is most certainly not organized akin to a Western criminal organization with specific command and control functions.\n\nTo this point, as of 2004, it was estimated that almost two-thirds of the senior leadership of al Qaeda had either been captured or killed. If this were a typical American crime family, it would be safe to assume the family would be out of business. This has not been the case for al Qeada. In fact, the July 2005 London bombings purportedly occurred without specific leadership from abroad. Conversely, the 2009 plot by three Londoners to detonate seven bombs on airliners bound for North America was tied directly to al Qaeda. These actions suggest that al Qaeda is alive and well despite this loss of \u201cleadership.\u201d\n\nWhile al Qaeda, as led by bin Laden, may have once provided funding or training for some of these groups, currently many them, as characterized by the 2005 London bombings, likely work largely independently. In fact, while bin Laden had at one time bankrolled al Qaeda, his ability over the past decade to do so was limited by the fact that he was cut off from the family fortune; and even if he still had some independent wealth, moving those funds would have likely given U.S. operatives information as to his whereabouts.\n\nConceptually, bin Laden\u2019s key role over the past decade seemed to have been to fan the flames of discord against the United States, and the Western world generally. In this effort, he was certainly successful and the al Qaeda network will likely need to fill this vacuum.\n\nUltimately, the real legacy of bin Laden is the hundreds of thousands of operatives that have been trained in al Qaeda terrorist camps. In fact, Gary Bernsten, a former senior ranking CIA official, and author of Jawbreaker, has estimated this number to be as high as 800,000. Despite the death of bin Laden, this large group of like-minded Islamic terrorists continues to exist.\n\nIt is also important to note that, based on the evidence, al Qaeda activities are typically planned years in advance of when they are actually intended to occur. Therefore, even if bin Laden were more directly involved in orchestrating broader terrorist activities of the al Qaeda network than we believe he was, it is still not likely that any potential attacks currently in the pipeline would necessarily be thrown off course. The primary example of this process is the September 11th attacks in the United States. According to reports, the idea for these attacks was germinated in 1996 and planning began in 1998, which was a full three years before they occurred.\n\nNot surprisingly, equity markets, as a proxy of investors\u2019 propensity to accept more risk, have completely shaken off any potential positive impact of bin Laden\u2019s death. This is partially because of the points outlined above, which suggest that killing bin Laden likely won\u2019t halt terrorist activity in the intermediate term, but also because there is real potential that bin Laden\u2019s death accelerates terrorist activity on the basis of avenging bin Laden. In fact, Hamas started stirring such emotions by stating the following in a press release:\n\n\u201cWe condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior. We ask God to offer him mercy with the true believers and the martyrs.\u201d\n\nWe certainly won\u2019t suggest that the world is not a better place with the death of bin Laden, but it is not quite clear that is a safer place, or that geopolitical risk premiums should be reset lower as a result. While the head of the serpent has been cut off, the snake is still very much alive.",
        "generated": "The death of Osama bin Laden is a moral victory for the United States, but its impact on geopolitical risk is uncertain, as al Qaeda is still active and bin Laden's death may even accelerate terrorist activity if he is perceived as a martyr.",

        "text": "1. Follow the flows.New research from Stanford Graduate School of Business found evidence that many mutual managers were skilled, but highlighted the importance of finding low-fee active managers. Professors Jonathan Berk and Jules H. van Binsbergen, who has since moved to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, looked at a universe of 5,974 mutual funds from 1969 to 2011 and compared the funds' results to comparable Vanguard index funds. They found evidence of skill\u2014outperformers continued outperforming over time. The researchers also found that the skilled managers attracted more assets\u2014and, in fact, very quickly. If you have a pot of money to invest and are seeking an actively managed fund, one basis you could use to pick is the fund flows, if you're on top of the latest data on at least a quarterly basis, said Berk.\n\n2. Look for fees under 1 percent on actively managed U.S. equity funds. The research also showed that one of the reasons it's been so difficult for experts and investing services to find skilled mutual fund managers is that they charge so much in fees. But at least you know they're out there.\n\nOn average, actively managed equity funds charged investors 1.37 percent in expense ratios in 2013, according to the Investment Company Institute. That's down from 1.6 percent in 2000. On an asset-weighted basis, the decline has been even more significant, because investors have been pouring money into the lowest-priced funds.\n\nIt is possible to find good money managers charging less than 1 percent. In fact, that's what individual investors should look for, suggested Ram Lee, president at New York City-based Seven Bridges Advisors, which has $3.8 billion in assets and offers CIO services to institutions, individuals and families. A lower fee gives you a much better chance of beating the market and is also a sign that a fund company and a manager are aware of the way the wind is blowing: toward lower-priced funds. Rekenthaler's list of five active funds worth a look (included below) all have expense ratios substantially under 1 percent, except for the American Funds' New World Fund, which comes in right above 1 percent.\n\n3. Understand that it's progressively harder for good managers to deliver good returns. In his first five years managing Fidelity's Magellan Fund, according to Berk's paper, famous fund manager Peter Lynch had a 2 percent monthly gross alpha on average assets of about $40 million. In his last five years, his outperformance was only 20 basis points per month on assets that ultimately grew to more than $10 billion.\n\nLynch still had the same level of skill; he just was spreading it thinner. \"As the capital flows in, the alpha goes down,\" said Berk.\n\nAs their funds become larger, managers cannot always find the amount of stock they need in all the right companies to build stellar portfolios for all their clients. That leads to the next idea: You need to know how much money the manager is managing.\n\nThe prospectus will include the total in the fund in which you're investing. But according to Lee, many managers use the same strategy to invest assets outside the fund. So you'll probably want to email the mutual fund company and ask if the manager is also managing assets for institutions. \"Anything above $25 billion is a lot,\" he said.\n\n4. Don't expect the game to be easy. Investors such as Lee personally interview managers and hone their analysis and instincts. Lee, for instance, looks for managers who try to beat the market by understanding downside risk and those who have a system for how they pick the companies they invest in. \"We focus a lot on repeatability of their process,\" Lee said. You won't be able to interview managers, but you can look for detailed letters that describe fund holdings and the manager's strategy.\n\nRekenthaler said it's only in some bear markets that active managers ability to control downside risk has a benefits. \"In 2008, active managers did not do better than indexes. But in 2000 to 2002, the market dropped a lot, led by high-priced tech stocks. A lot of active managers that outperformed substantially avoided the one big market sector, technology.\"\n\nOne thing Lee doesn't look at: labels, like growth vs.value. Those labels are determined by a fund's holdings and thus can easily change even within a year.\n\n5. Finally, don't forget the taxes. Many professional investors look for managers who aim to buy and hold companies for the long term, so take a look at the fund turnover, too. \"On taxable portfolios, the tax consequences of a high-turnover approach\" could erase any of the returns you've earned above the market, said Jonathan Blau, CEO of Fusion Family Wealth.",

For example, MEDI4736, one of the drugs bought when AZ acquired MedImmune in 2007, is now expected to fetch around $6.5 billion annually, compared to analyst estimates of $2-$7 billion.\n\nThe announcement came after Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was \"very disappointed\" by the AstraZeneca board's refusal to engage with Pfizer over its improved $106.5 billion bid for the company.

His gravitational pull was so strong that even Drake had no choice but collaborate with him on the summer release \u201cWhat a Time to Be Alive.\u201d\n\nWhen Future sat down with DJ Khaled Friday night on the first episode of Khaled\u2019s new Beats 1 Radio show, the agenda included more than just mutual back-patting for newly-signed, presumably lucrative deals with Apple Music (\u201cWhen I got the deal, I said, \u2018Sensational!\u2019 \u201d Future said, embodying his own meme.) Future was also set to unveil what would be his seventh project in barely over a year.\n\nKhaled, whose talent as a DJ has been overshadowed lately by his SnapChat phenomenon, had Future\u2019s latest album, \u201cEVOL,\u201d in his hands, and it was as if they both were admiring bottled lightning. The album, which was made available to preorder for release at midnight, comes three weeks ahead of his Purple Reign Tour stop in Boston on Feb. 26. It also comes barely three weeks after Future no-so-coincidentally dropped off the 13-track surprise tape, \u201cPurple Reign,\u201d just hours before his ex-fiancee Ciara\u2019s new flame, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, opened up the NFL playoffs. (The Seahawks lost; memes ensued.)\n\nFuture and Khaled talked about the meaning of the album title \u2013 \u201cLove\u201d backward, as well as evolution. But with Future\u2019s tip-toeing on the fine line between harnessing bottled-lightning inspiration and clutching onto short attention spans while he knows he has them, they also talked about how much Future music was flooding the market.\n\nFuture explained the logic behind constantly feeding fans and clubs alike. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit and have them wonder if I love them; I want to show them immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that moment it was clear that for Future, oversaturation doesn\u2019t matter if he could defy it.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t DMX in the late \u201990s, dropping three albums in 20 months (all hit No. 1), but then eventually crashing into a wall. He wasn\u2019t millennial machine Curren$y, putting six albums a year into the air like a running stream of consciousness. Future was dictating his own terms.\n\n\u201cWhen you look back at Future and his career,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to be like, he set the tone, he set the vibe for his own career.\u201d\n\nHe was more than aware that last year\u2019s \u201cDirty Sprite 2\u201d was his tipping point. On the strength of next-generation trap beats that morphed and mutated into something both sinister and soulful, \u201cDS2\u201d was unlike anything else. But in terms of narration, it was the climax of a story Future had been weaving for months. \u201cWhere Ya At\u201d was exquisite because of the way producer Metro Boomin managed to contort the strings from Stan Getz\u2019s sensuous 1960 slow-burner \u201cGoodbye\u201d into an absolute earthquake. But it was also gripping, one of the flashpoint moments when Future wasn\u2019t binging on drugs but purging the feelings of abandonment and loss that he was trying to escape.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dirty Sprite 2,\u2019 I feel like they got me,\u201d he told Khaled. \u201cI marked my territory with \u2018DS2.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cEVOL\u201d keeps listeners in the same frame, even if the emotions aren\u2019t as driven. At one point, on the album opener \u201cAin\u2019t No Time,\u201d he admits to the push and pull of his music\u2019s infectiousness and indecipherability: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we be saying / We just be yelling out, \u2018bon jour.\u2019 \u201d There\u2019s less distress, more hedonism.\n\nThe only leftover trace of whatever bitterness he may still feel shows up on \u201cLow Life,\u201d featuring the Weeknd. How Future\u2019s love-stoned spiral hasn\u2019t intersected with the Weeknd\u2019s walk-of-shame sensibilities until now is hard to fathom, but he raps shamelessly, \u201cIf she catch me cheating, I won\u2019t ever tell her sorry.\u201d\n\nFuture\u2019s still comfortable in the zone he fell into 20 months ago, so much so that he told Khaled he doesn\u2019t even remember how many albums he\u2019s released.\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to continue to build. I\u2019ve got to continue to move on.\u201d\n\nThe thing about momentum, though, is that as exciting as it is to watch it build, the inevitable question is: When will it eventually run out?",

A lot of traders have lost money today, since many were flat to short the market. These traders are mad. The Fed did not communicate its intentions clearly enough, they contend.\n\nI don't believe that. The market misread the Fed. The market convinced themselves that even though the data was weak, it was still strong enough to warrant a modest taper. Heck, even I convinced myself that a modest taper was likely.\n\nBut the Fed has always insisted it was data-dependent. It just gave very vague guidance.\n\nWill this not lead to calls for more explicit communication? Sure. Bernanke, in response to a question from Greg Ip, said, \"We are discussing how we might clarify the guidance on the federal funds rate.\" He specifically mentioned having a floor for inflation.\n\nBut what the market really wants is a blueprint for exactly what they will be doing in the coming months. The Fed can't do that, not when you're dealing with something as complex as the U.S. economy.\n\nFinally, kudos to my colleagues Maria Bartiromo and Bill Griffeth, two of the few who thought the Fed would not taper.",

Bouchard ruled that the social network\u2019s minority shareholders are entitled to their day in court over the salaries that Facebook\u2019s directors received.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the company\u2019s board are being sued because a shareholder thinks the pay the directors were awarded in 2013 was too high. Board members decide their own pay, but in this case, the dispute is over whether it was excessive and whether the board acted in shareholders\u2019 interests.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Zuckerberg, who owns a majority of Facebook\u2019s shares, signed an affidavit saying he approved the pay. In a deposition related to the case, he said: \u201cThese are the people who I want and\u2014and who I think will serve the company best, and I think that the compensation plan that we have is doing its job of attracting and retaining them over the long term.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s lawyers claimed that was enough under Delaware law to conclude the majority of shareholders had approved the director pay packages. That matters under Delaware law (where Facebook and many large corporations are incorporated), because unless shareholders have approved the directors\u2019 pay, the Facebook board has to show the pay was fair. But if shareholders approved board members\u2019 pay, they could rely on a presumption that they exercised sound business judgement.\n\nThe judge said not so fast. Just because Zuckerberg signed an affidavit and spoke in a deposition doesn\u2019t mean Facebook is entitled to an easier case.\n\nDelaware law is pretty loose when it comes to shareholder approval. It can be done at a shareholder meeting, by unanimous consent of shareholders, or even by majority shareholder consent \u201cwithout a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote,\u201d Bouchard wrote.\n\nBut Bouchard said protocols under the law on when Zuckerberg was speaking for shareholders matter. To use the majority shareholder consent provision, Zuckerberg not only had to make it clear for whom he was speaking and that he was entitled to speak for the majority, he also had to disclose his action to shareholders following his decision. \u201cIn the case of action taken by written consent, [shareholders are entitled] to receive prompt notice after the fact of the action taken,\u201d the judge wrote. According to the judge, these requirements protect the corporation and its shareholders.\n\nThe rights of minority shareholders are critical to corporate governance. In fact, it\u2019s one area of governance that countries across the globe have been able to agree on. It\u2019s that basic. So because minority shareholders did not get their due, including receiving notice of Zuckerberg\u2019s actions, this case is going forward, as it should.\n\nEleanor Bloxham is CEO of The Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance (http://www.thevaluealliance.com), an independent board education and advisory firm she founded in 1999.

But Prince Akishino and his wife, Princess Kiko, have two daughters, and, despite prodding from the Imperial Household Agency, are not believed to be trying for a third child.\n\nRecent opinion polls show that most Japanese overwhelmingly back the idea of an empress, though support dips for a female line.\n\nAccording to Japanese myth, the first emperor, Jimmu, a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, began his reign 2,665 years ago; historians, though, trace the start of Japan's imperial system to the fourth or fifth century.\n\nSome opponents of establishing a female imperial line cite that ancient precedent. Tsuneyasu Takeda, 30, a member of a former imperial family branch, said Japan should no more alter Horyu Temple, its oldest wooden building, than interfere with the throne's unbroken male bloodline.\n\n\"Why not rebuild Horyu Temple as a concrete building?\" said Mr. Takeda, author of the recently published book \"The Truth About the Imperial Family.\" He answered himself: \"If you did, it would be something completely different.\"\n\nThe emperor, Mr. Takeda said, was valued \"not because he is intelligent or handsome.\"\n\n\"It's because he is the inheritor of the blood that has been preserved for 2,000 years,\" he said.\n\nOther opponents add genetics to their argument. Since women have two X chromosomes while men have an X and a Y, the imperial throne's male line has preserved its Y chromosome intact.\n\n\"Maintaining the male line is the condition to preserving that Y chromosome,\" said Hakubun Shimomura, a lawmaker for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, who is one of the leaders of a campaign to reject the panel's recommendation.\n\n\"The bloodline is important for the emperor to be a symbol of the nation and the unity of the people,\" Mr. Shimomura added. \"This symbolic imperial throne preserves Japan's culture and tradition in total. The imperial throne is Japan itself.\"\n\nLike many other opponents, Mr. Shimomura does not oppose Princess Aiko's ascension to the throne, as long as a male with the right Y chromosome will succeed her. Princess Aiko would be a \"pinch hitter,\" he added, the same way the previous eight empresses had been.\n\nBut where to find the right Y? During the American postwar occupation, two groups that had ensured male heirs over the centuries were abolished: other imperial branch families, like Mr. Takeda's, and concubines, who are said to have given birth to about half of past emperors.\n\nReacting against the panel, a cousin of the current emperor, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, 59, wrote that those two groups should be resurrected to maintain the throne's male lineage. \"I wholeheartedly support it,\" the prince wrote about a revival of the concubine system, \"but I think that the social mood inside and outside the country may make it a little difficult.\"\n\n\"Unless we carefully hold and express opinions regarding 2,665 years of history and tradition, we'll move in the direction of changing Japan's 'national essence,' \" the prince wrote. \"Furthermore, one day, arguments that the imperial system is not needed will even emerge.\"\n\nBut some supporters of the panel's recommendations say that a female line would bring badly needed equality to a society where a woman is still expected to join a man's family upon marriage, take his family name and be buried in his family's grave.\n\nFor most of the throne's history, emperors lived quietly in Kyoto. But during the Meiji Restoration of the late 1800's, as Japan tried to modernize and catch up with the West, Emperor Meiji was brought to the forefront to try to unify Japan; his grandson, Emperor Hirohito, who died in 1989, was considered divine until Japan's defeat in World War II.\n\nMikiyo Kano, a professor of women's history at Keiwa College, said that after Meiji, the emperor and his wife were held up as models for the Japanese. Starting with Meiji and until Japan's defeat, emperors dressed in military uniforms, while their wives promoted the Red Cross and patriotic associations.\n\n\"I think the male succession system in the imperial family has led to the discrimination and oppression of women in general in Japan,\" Ms. Kano said. A female line would make a woman the symbolic leader of the nation and show a man deferring to her, as wives of emperors do, she said.\n\n\"If Princess Aiko became empress, it might be a little better for the realization of the equality of men and women, rather than clinging to the male line,\" Ms. Kano said. \"I'm basically for ending this system where wives always stand back while the emperor speaks, or walk behind him. That kind of image says a lot to ordinary people.\"",

And former No. 1 overall pick Mychal Thompson retired, playing only one game of the series. He left the NBA with averages of 13.7 points and 7.4 rebounds, underwhelming for a player selected five spots ahead of Larry Bird.\n\nBut don't feel bad for Thompson. He played a year in Italy and then moved back to Portland, where he had started his career, with his 2-year-old son, Klay. Klay, three inches shorter than his father at 6-7, developed into an elite NBA shooter. He met Stephen Curry, son of one of Mychal's NBA contemporaries, Dell Curry. The two became the Splash Brothers, and the rest is history.\n\nJackson says the dads not being superstars is an important part of that history.\n\n\"For these people who don't know Mychal Thompson or Dell Curry, neither one of them was a great success coming into the game,\" Jackson said, on a panel with Shaquille O'Neal hosted by Hannah Storm, presented by American Express. \"They faced hardship. Mychal was the first pick of the draft. He did not have immediate success. His success came when he went to the Lakers and won championships. Dell was an expansion player, from Cleveland to Charlotte. We always loved his shot. He was a great shooter, but he never really had that great success.\"\n\nDell averaged 11.7 points in 16 seasons. He won a Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1993-94, but he only started 99 of 1,083 career games. Like Mychal, he retired with solid, but not spectacular statistics.\n\nJackson has never coached Klay Thompson or Stephen Curry, but he worked with the ultimate example of non-superstar NBA player having a son that developed into an elite performer.\n\n\"I always thought about Kobe [Bryant],\" Jackson says. \"His father was a player that lasted a couple years in the NBA and then went over to Italy and never really had the success he wanted or felt he deserved. I think the children of those type of parents really have a drive to overrun their father, to do better than their father, to knock the king off the throne.\"\n\nBryant's father, Joe, was the No. 14 pick in the 1975 NBA draft by the Warriors and was traded to the 76ers before his first game. Joe averaged 8.7 points in eight NBA seasons before playing eight years in Europe. Kobe was a bit more successful.\n\nLikewise, Stephen and Klay have already surpassed their dads, regardless of how this NBA Finals turns out. Both are All-Stars who have led their team to championships.\n\nPerhaps raising sons more skilled than themselves are Mychal and Dell's most prideful basketball accomplishments.\n\nMore NBA: -- Klay Thompson: We're Better Than Showtime Lakers -- Riley Curry Rules Stephen's Emoji App -- Here's What Curry Said To Durant After Game 7\n\nFollow Jeffrey Eisenband on Twitter @JeffEisenband.\n\nBasketball, Dad, Dell Curry, Golden State Warriors, Joe Bryant, Klay Thompson, Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers, mychal thompson, NBA, Phil Jackson, Stephen Curry",

Revised financial statements, additional underwriters, the specific number of shares being offered, etc.\n\nOne thing that almost always remains constant, however, is the bank that\u2019s in charge (otherwise known as the \u201cleft lead,\u201d due to its physical position on the registration document). Unless that bank disappears \u2014 think Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers in 2010 \u2014 companies stick with the one that brung \u2019em.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so surprising when Reuters recently reported that Deutsche Bank DB had quit as left lead for an upcoming IPO for iWatt, a California maker power management semiconductors.\n\niWatt had filed for the $75 million offering just a few weeks earlier. Not the sort of deal that would generate major headlines, but it was still a (barely) profitable tech company with high-profile venture capital investors like VantagePoint Venture Partners and Sigma Partners. More importantly, Deutsche Bank likely would have banked a couple million dollars.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the dispute centered around valuation. The article doesn\u2019t get more specific, but its suggestion is that iWatt CEO Ron Edgerton felt the company was worth more than did Deutsche Bank.\n\nSounds like a good cause for divorce, but the story I\u2019m hearing is much different. Multiple sources familiar with the situation tell me that iWatt and Deutsche had not yet begun to seriously discuss price. Instead, they were simply deciding whether or not iWatt should even move full-steam ahead with an IPO at this point in time. The company wanted to push forward, while the bank wanted to hold back.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear is Deutsche\u2019s hesitance was born of macro or internal issues. The former could include Europe\u2019s daily proclivity for causing havoc in U.S. markets, or the fact that no U.S. company had gone public since Facebook priced in May 18 (note: that dry spell was snapped on Tuesday night). Indeed, many companies have postponed, or even withdrawn IPO registrations over the past several weeks.\n\nThe latter could simply be that Deutsche Bank had too much other business on its plate right now, and iWatt got pushed down the list of priorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was Facebook fallout or something else, but the whole thing was just very strange,\u201d one source said. \u201cFrom my perspective, everyone just should have waited to see if ServiceNow was able to price, since it also was a VC-backed, non-consumer tech company.\u201d\n\n[Note: ServiceNow NOW priced its IPO last night at $18 per share, and was trading at $23.86 as of this writing].\n\nWhat we know for sure, however, is that several other bulge-bracket banks inquired about replacing Deutsche Bank as the left lead. The company currently is in serious discussions with at least one of them, although it also may simply promote Barclays Bank to sole lead underwriter status. Barclays had been listed to the right of Deutsche in the original registration statement, with smaller banks Canaccord Genuity, Baird and Needham & Co. on the second line.\n\nBoth iWatt and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\n\nSign up for Dan\u2019s daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com",

        "text": "October 11 is National Coming Out Day in the United States, and it's widely celebrated in America's LGBTQ community as an opportunity to share individual coming-out stories as well as to reflect on social gains.\n\nBut in more than 70 countries around the world, coming out isn't always worth celebrating (yet). In the nations that criminalize LGBTQ people, coming out\u2014or being forcibly outed\u2014can result in banishment, jail or even death. T\u00e9a Braun, Legal Director at the Human Dignity Trust, said Coming Out Day stands as a reminder that there's still a long way to go.\n\n\"Coming out is still a life and death question in many places around the world,\" Braun told NBC OUT. \"LGBT people continue to be arrested, prosecuted, lashed, raped, forced or coerced into straight marriages, assaulted and murdered if their identity is known or suspected.\"\n\nAfter the 2015 Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S. and a string of federal policy changes that have made schools and healthcare providers more LGBTQ-inclusive, some Americans may feel as if the battle has been won. But in countries like Uganda, the past few years\u2014with increasing LGBTQ visibility and trends toward acceptance worldwide\u2014have been worse than ever.\n\nAn April 2016 report published by Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) showed that violent crimes and police and government harassment against the LGBTQ community increased after the country passed a vicious Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2014. The law has since been overturned by a court, but its intended consequences (life imprisonment for gay sex) have increased stigmatization of Uganda's LGBTQ community.\n\nBraun said that international policy is trending toward LGBTQ equality, with Belize, Seychelles, Mozambique, Nauru and Palau recently decriminalizing homosexuality. But as a smattering of nations slowly drop laws that send LGBTQ people to jail or death row, the situation remains dire for many elsewhere.\n\nComing out is particularly risky in Islamic nations in the Middle East, where the majority of countries either have laws on the books that punish homosexuality with the death penalty (whether or not the penalty is enforced), or where executions frequently occur despite no specific law mandating them. According to the International Lesbian and Gay Association's (ILGA) 2016 report State-Sponsored Homophobia, those nations include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Daesh/the Islamic State (which is not recognized as a country).\n\nThere's a certain Catch-22, though, to visibility and coming out in countries that criminalize LGBTQ populations.\n\n\"Visibility is key for the advancement of LGBTI human rights,\" ILGA Executive Director Renato Sabbadini told NBC OUT via email. \"Most people are more likely to understand the discrimination LGBTI people face and empathise with them if they realize that the LGBTI acronym is used not to refer to an empty abstraction\u2014but to identify a set of real people, including their children, relatives, friends or colleagues.\"\n\nSabbadini was referring specifically to the findings of ILGA's Global Attitudes Survey on LGBTI People, conducted in partnership with the television network LOGO. The 2016 survey found that 34 percent of respondents had become more accepting of LGBTQ people in the past five years, reporting that their favorable attitude shifts were a direct result of knowing an LGBTQ person. The numbers show that just by being out, an LGBTQ person can instigate social change starting with their own communities.\n\nBut even when being LGBTQ isn't punishable by death or life imprisonment at the hands of your government, it's not always safe to be out. Stan Ibrahim is a Kuwaiti transgender man who publishes the world's only Arabic-language transgender magazine. He shared his own coming-out story with NBC OUT, explaining that while being LGBTQ can get you sent to jail in Kuwait, \"at least you won't be killed or beheaded.\"\n\n\"I thought that being a transsexual is to have a mental illness that will go away after going to a psychologist,\" Ibrahim wrote in English in a direct Twitter message on Tuesday. He said he started to come out as transgender at age 14, and his parents were shocked\u2014insisting that it is a phase that will end by the time he graduates college later this year.\n\nIn the U.S., the transgender community struggled for years to not be seen as mentally ill. The removal of Gender Identity Disorder from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 was celebrated as a step toward destigmatizing the community. But in Kuwait, as in many Middle Eastern countries, transgender people are struggling to have gender difference accepted as a mental health status\u2014because then, at least, it might be treated as a fixed human condition rather than as a depraved choice.\n\nKuwait currently criminalizes transgender people under a 2007 law that bans \"imitating the opposite sex.\" Ironically, the law makes no provision for Gender Identity Disorder\u2014a medical condition recognized by the country's Ministry of Health. As a result, according to Human Rights Watch, transgender women in particular are arrested and abused by police on a regular basis.\n\nApart from the frequent arrests, Ibrahim said that being LGBTQ in Kuwait is marked by constant bullying, harassment, and mockery from family and peers.\n\n\"[My father is] driving me to college every day, and every day he mocks my hair and my dress,\" Ibrahim said. \"So he is my number one bully.\"\n\n\"Religious families take their LGBT children to a cleric or sheikh. And of course they'll be punished, they'll face a lot of physical violence,\" Ibrahim explained. \"Parents won't let their daughters and sons become your friend. And if anyone saw you hanging out as queer or LGBT, they have the right to litigate you. And the law stands by them.\"\n\nDespite the hardships, though, Ibrahim told NBC OUT he's glad he came out\u2014even if it meant potentially risking his family, friends and even his life.\n\n\"Staying closeted is worse,\" Ibrahim said. \"You'll hate yourself and you'll be ashamed of who you are. I don't accept being marginalized.\"\n\nFollow NBC OUT on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.",

Martinez -- could easily waltz away with it.\n\nKardashian, 24, comes into the final episode in first place. The reality star has shown steady development throughout the season, and he and professional partner Cheryl Burke dazzled on the penultimate dance-off with an elegant waltz and a rip-roaring, swing-inspired freestyle routine that judges rewarded with a perfect score.\n\n\"I couldn't have asked for a better ending of the season,\" Kardashian said Monday. \"We got our first perfect score. We're in first place. We did it with the most crucial dance, which is the freestyle. It's just surreal and I still can't even believe it.\"\n\nLake and Martinez, who have each topped the judges' leaderboard throughout the 10-week competition, are tied for second place.\n\nLake said she's pleased with what she's accomplished on the show, regardless of the final outcome. She earned high scores all season, dropped more than 25 pounds and performed some impressive dance moves.\n\n\"I've come way further than I ever thought or anyone else thought, so, I don't expect to win,\" the 43-year-old TV personality said. \"I'm just happy to be among these two other guys. J.R. and Rob really have proven themselves. They're amazing people and I'm just happy to be one of them.\"\n\nLake's professional partner, Derek Hough, said they've had \"a winning season.\"\n\n\"I feel like we can walk away (Tuesday), win or lose, and say, `Yeah, we won,\"' he said. Martinez and partner Karina Smirnoff are happy about the tricky stunts they pulled off in their freestyle routine -- which earned a perfect score -- but they'll be even happier if they win the trophy Tuesday.\n\n\"I think we have a great shot at it,\" said Martinez, 28, an actor and Iraq war veteran. \"It would be an amazing thing. It'd be her first mirrorball trophy, which she deserves, and it would be my first, of course. We both want to win it for each other.\"\n\nSmirnoff, who has been on the hit ABC show for 10 seasons, said taking the title would be like \"a perfect ending to a perfect story.\"\n\n\"With everything we went through... it's like this mirrorball would justify everything,\" she said.\n\n\"No matter what happens, I feel like it has been such a fulfilling experience overall. But the mirrorball trophy would make it that much better. It's the truth.\"\n\nThe three couples will perform their favorite dance of the season for another score from the judges before the third-place finalists are eliminated. The remaining two pairs will compete in one final routine for the season 13 title.\n\nViewer votes count for half of each contestant's overall score, but the last chance to cast votes was Monday.\n\nThe two-hour season finale is also set to feature music by Lady Antebellum and is expected to include appearances by this season's former contestants: TV personalities Nancy Grace and Carson Kressley, reality star Kristin Cavallari, actors David Arquette and Elisabetta Canalis, singer Chynna Phillips, activist Chaz Bono, basketball player Metta World Peace and soccer star Hope Solo.",

They\u2019ve spent the last decade in court trying to get it back.\n\nThe Bakers built the voice recognition software company Dragon Systems from scratch and eventually sold it for $580 million to a Dutch company, Lernout & Hauspie, in 2000. Just two months later, news accounts detailed bogus international sales that had boosted the buyer\u2019s financial statements. Soon, the entire business collapsed in a bankrupt heap.\n\nThe Bakers, who took their $300 million share of proceeds entirely in Lernout & Hauspie stock, lost everything when the company failed.\n\nEver since, the couple and others have sued everyone in sight: accountants, commercial bankers who did business with Lernout & Hauspie and the Dutch company\u2019s investment banker. They\u2019ve recovered about $70 million settling those lawsuits.\n\nNow a jury is about to hear the Bakers\u2019 last big case \u2014 perhaps their biggest \u2014 against the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Jury selection is scheduled to start Monday in US District Court in Boston for a trial expected to last about five weeks.\n\nThe complaint in a nutshell: You should have figured out those guys were crooks.\n\nGoldman acted as the adviser to Dragon Systems in its merger negotiations and \u2014 by the Bakers\u2019 account \u2014 did a stunningly bad job. Alan Cotler, a Philadelphia lawyer representing the Bakers, says the couple \u2014 true pioneers in voice recognition technology \u2014 lost more than just money.\n\n\u201cJim and Janet Baker spent about 25 years of their lives creating Dragon to realize their dream of having millions of people use computers and other devices that understand human speech,\u201d says Cotler, who was in Boston Thursday preparing for the trial.\n\n\u201cGoldman Sachs played a fundamental role in the Bakers losing all that,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, speech recognition is being used throughout the world, and its best and most productive applications are still to come.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs you would expect, the investment bank doesn\u2019t see it that way. Goldman says it \u201cperformed its assignment satisfactorily in all respects.\u201d It said the Baker claims \u201care completely without merit.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know who has the better legal case, and the Bakers certainly made some odd, regrettable decisions along the way. But their Wall Street advisers fell far short in advising Dragon Systems on a sale to a buyer that newspaper reports uncovered as a fraud just months after closing (The Wall Street Journal simply called purported L&H customers and discovered they weren\u2019t doing business with the company).\n\nSurely no one familiar with Dragon Systems in its earliest days could have ever imagined how the story would unfold.\n\nThe Bakers were serious technology professionals who became bootstrap entrepreneurs in the 1980s, building a company around their voice recognition technology without the help of venture capitalists. Later, when they needed money to grow a successful business, they sold stock to disk drive maker Seagate Technology.\n\nIn fact, voice recognition was starting to attract the attention of much bigger technology companies. As the 1990s came to an end, conversation at Dragon Systems shifted from selling shares to selling the company.\n\nThe company hired Goldman in December of 1999 as an adviser. The transaction was small potatoes for Goldman, worth $5 million in fees. But it was the deal of a lifetime for the Bakers, and it went south in a hurry.\n\nI don\u2019t know why Dragon Systems\u2019 directors didn\u2019t get a formal fairness opinion about the sale proposal from Goldman \u2014 a point the investment bankers raise in their legal defense. I also don\u2019t know if it would have mattered.\n\nHanded a pile of stock, I can\u2019t explain why the sellers didn\u2019t use common financial strategies to hedge some of the risk. The Bakers still would have lost control of their technology, but much or all of their fortune might have been preserved.\n\nThe voice recognition technology acquired by Lernout & Hauspie was sold with other \u00adassets in bankruptcy. Today, it is owned by Nuance Communications Inc. of Burlington, which sells a line of software products bearing the Dragon name.\n\nIt took Dragon Systems years to get its groundbreaking technology to market. It\u2019s taking almost as long to sort out responsibility for the company\u2019s disastrous end.",

        "text": "Zsuzsi Roboz, who has died aged 82, was an artist with a gift for portraiture. Though she never regarded herself as being primarily a portrait painter, posterity will undoubtedly be grateful to her for her interest in portraying leading creative personalities of her time. These included figures from the worlds of dance, theatre, literature and music \u2013 she made a striking likeness of the conductor Sir Georg Solti, though she complained that he never took his nose out of a score that he was reading in preparation for an upcoming performance.\n\nHer 2011 series, Face to Face, was devoted to notable British and Irish writers, among them personalities as different from one another as Anita Brookner, Tom Stoppard, Seamus Heaney and PD James. She always tried to give these likenesses something that went further than simple realism. Essentially she was a symbolist artist \u2013 she wanted to catch the creative aura of those she portrayed, many of whom have not otherwise been the subjects of penetrating works of art of this sort.\n\nZsuzsi's beginnings were prosperous. She was born in Budapest, where her father, Imre Roboz, was the manager of the V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z theatre, which specialised in operetta in a city that particularly relished this form of entertainment. Her mother was a society hostess. Budapest was largely unscathed during the early years of the second world war, when Hungary had prudently, if reluctantly, taken the side of the Axis.\n\nFor most of the war years, the Roboz family lived a relatively unthreatened existence. But as the Russian army approached, Germany staged a coup and replaced the Hungarian government, and things then changed drastically. Budapest was besieged and Zsuzsi's father disappeared, killed, as her family later discovered, by the invading Russians.\n\nZsuzsi, her mother and a French lodger were sheltered by neighbours and eventually made a dramatic escape under gunfire across the melting ice of the Danube, and found their way to the safety of the allies.\n\nAfter a brief period in France, Zsuzsi was sent to secretarial school in London. There she soon made her way into the employ of the Hungarian film mogul Alexander Korda, who had been a friend of her father's at school. The real turning point in her life, however, came when she met the Italian painter Pietro Annigoni at one of his exhibitions in London. He was attracted by her charmingly gamine appearance, and she, no doubt, by the force of his personality. In 1954 she moved to Italy and spent a year in his studio class, returning to London equipped with skills as a draughtswoman.\n\nOne of her first commissions was to make drawings of what went on behind the scenes at the Windmill theatre, then in its last days of presenting nude revues. Throughout her career she was interested in portraying musicians and dancers, often in moments when they were at their most relaxed, and least conscious of the presence of a spectator.\n\nShe was part of a lively London bohemian scene. She made a brief marriage, in 1953, to an illustrator, Ley Kenyon, who made the mistake of thinking that she would be entirely obedient to his wishes. He discovered his mistake, as she later gleefully recalled, one night when he came home late from the pub. He went to the bathroom, and Zsuzsi, who had already packed her bags, locked him in and departed. They divorced, but in later years remained on reasonably friendly terms. Kenyon later became Jacques Cousteau's assistant.\n\nHer second marriage, in 1964, to the property developer Teddy Smith was a different matter. He admired what she did and was eager to encourage her talent. The fact that he was a patron of the recently founded Chichester Festival theatre gave her access to luminaries of the British stage. In 1972 she was commissioned to make a series of portraits celebrating 10 years of the enterprise. Her portrait drawing of Leslie Evershed-Martin, who founded the theatre, is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, as is her likeness of Dame Ninette de Valois, evidence of her continuing interest in the world of dance and dancers.\n\nAfter Smith's death, Zsuzsi lived quietly in Mayfair. She also had a small studio in Pimlico. Her chief way of entertaining was through a half-share in a grand-tier box at the Royal Albert Hall, which she used chiefly for the Proms. She particularly loved the late Romantic composers, such as Mahler. She also loved Bart\u00f3k, who was part of a Hungarian identity that Zsuzsi never completely abandoned. Her British friends used to joke that it was fatal to go with her to any gathering where there were Hungarian-speakers, as she immediately lapsed into that difficult but fascinating language, and left her companion stranded.\n\nShe is survived by Anthony, a stepson from her second marriage.\n\n\u2022 Zsuzsi (Suzanne) Roboz, artist, born 15 August 1929; died 9 July 2012",

        "text": "photos by Josh Reynolds for The Boston Globe\n\nChris Carrabba (left) of Dashboard Confessional and Third Eye Blind lead singer Stephan Jenkins at Blue Hills Bank Pavilion Thursday.\n\nNear the end of his band Dashboard Confessional\u2019s set at the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion on Thursday, singer-guitarist Chris Carrabba explained why his recently reborn anthemic-emo act decided to tour with Third Eye Blind. \u201cWhat do our fans have in common?\u201d he asked. \u201cAll our fans can sing.\u201d (He used a glowing yet unpublishable descriptor to drive the point home.)\n\nThursday\u2019s audience more than proved up to the challenge during the dual-headliner show. But the two bands share much more than chorale-ready devotees. Their hooky pop-rock crunch inspires lighter-raising and high fives; they showcase rapid-fire, brutally frank lyrics that detail the inner workings of the male mind; and most crucially, they share charismatic lead singers, men who know how to work a room even when they\u2019re baring their most brutal emotions.\n\nDashboard Confessional began as a stripped-down side project for Carrabba, who had fronted louder yet still feelings-forward acts like Further Seems Forever. It eventually came to the forefront for him, though, and as the band\u2019s popularity grew with songs like the gasping \u201cScreaming Infidelities\u201d and the intricate \u201cVindicated\u201d (which appeared on the \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d soundtrack), so did its sound, until it broke up in 2010.\n\nThe band\u2019s reunion earlier this year doubled as an opportunity for it to revisit its vast back catalog; Carrabba\u2019s potent voice served as a beacon, while his bandmates turned diaristic bedroom pop into roof-raising anthems. Carrabba was grateful and winking by turns, thanking the audience for sticking by him over the years and tossing off the occasional joke.\n\nThe San Francisco act Third Eye Blind is probably best known for \u201cSemi-Charmed Life,\u201d one of the \u201990s most potent tracks \u2014 thanks to its indelible hook (\u201cdoo doo do, doo da-doo doo\u201d), the existentially hedonistic track will rightfully be enshrined in that decade\u2019s pop time capsule alongside Smash Mouth\u2019s \u201cAll Star\u201d and the Rembrandts\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll Be There for You.\u201d\n\nBut the band\u2019s appeal reaches wider, as evidenced by Thursday night\u2019s throng. Lead singer Stephan Jenkins has a two-by-four voice, a preacher\u2019s charisma, and a startling willingness to lyrically reveal his worst traits; his band\u2019s omnivorous take on pop-rock helps the sourness go down a bit easier. The high-energy set, which included hits like the bubblegummy \u201cNever Let You Go\u201d alongside tracks from a just-released fifth album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d was supposed to end with \u201cLife.\u201d But Jenkins noticed a sign near the front asking for the straightforward album track \u201cGod of Wine,\u201d and he complied. The audience did, too.",

Tests show workers have impaired cognitive skills when working nine- to 12-hour days, and worker effectiveness falls off the cliff after 50 hours of work during the week.\n\nWorking outside of traditional hours or offices can also interfere with personal relationships.\n\n\"I spoke recently with a gentleman who works for a state government agency and he told me that he is constantly on Twitter on his phone after normal work hours,\" said Russell Clayton, a management professor at St. Leo University. \"He told me that in the evening he will use one hand to catch a ball thrown by his toddler son and use his other hand to scroll through Twitter.\"\n\nWhile it's possible to tweet and play catch\u2014at least, if you're well-coordinated\u2014most people wildly overestimate their ability to multitask. Stanford University research found that folks who described themselves as expert multitaskers actually performed worse on cognitive tests than the general population. Most experts agree that, with rare exceptions, \"multitasking\" is really just rapid toggling between tasks, which brings with it switching costs (\"Now where were we?\") that make the whole affair much less efficient.\n\nRead MoreWhy you should never work more than 50 hours a week",

Designed to mimic the act of barefoot running, the minimalist running shoe has a shaped sole and a mesh top, with individual sleeves for each toe.\n\nIn its advertising, Vibram says the shoe improves posture and strengthens leg muscles. But the lawsuit says that using FiveFingers may be risky for runners.\n\n\u201cIndeed, running in FiveFingers may increase injury risk as compared to running in conventional running shoes, and even when compared to running barefoot,\u2019\u2019 according to a copy of the suit, filed in US District Court in Boston.\n\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox:\n\nThe Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Vibram suit follows several recent cases against Massachusetts shoe companies about how they market sneakers.\n\nLast year, Canton-based Reebok International Ltd. refunded $25 million to customers after the Federal Trade Commission found it made deceptive claims that its toning shoes improved muscle tone. A suit filed in January 2011 alleged that New Balance, of Boston, also overstated the benefits of its toning shoes.\n\nFiveFingers shoes have gained in popularity. Still, according to SportsOne Source, which tracks the sporting goods industry, barefoot-style footwear represents only 8 percent of the $6.5 billion running shoe market in the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally different manner of running,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Powell, an analyst with SportsOne Source, \u201cand you need to be pretty dedicated to it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThere are similarities between the Vibram lawsuit and the Reebok case, but the Vibram claims differ, he said.\n\nWhile Reebok promised firmer butts and toned legs as a result of wearing its toning shoes, he said the Vibram claims are more about the benefits of barefoot running, which Vibram claims are supported by scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cAnd there is ample evidence that training without shoes allows you to run faster and farther with fewer injuries,\u2019\u2019 the company says on its website.\n\nVibram, with corporate headquarters in Italy, is a 70-year-old company known for pioneering the use of rubber soles for footwear.

        "text": "THE riposte to doubts about Abenomics, the three-part plan of Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, to shake the country from its economic torpor, is more of the same, and a lot more. On October 31st the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stunned the financial markets by unexpectedly expanding its programme of quantitative easing. The bank\u2019s existing measures, a \u201cdifferent dimension\u201d of easing from past efforts, were already daringly bold. Now it will swell Japan\u2019s monetary base at an even faster pace, by around \u00a580 trillion ($712 billion) each year, up from \u00a560 trillion-70 trillion currently. To do so, it will hoover up still larger quantities of Japanese government bonds (JGBs). This additional step, said Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the BoJ, \u201cshows our unwavering determination to end deflation\u201d.\n\nThe bank\u2019s action is also an admission of partial failure thus far. Its bond-buying has succeeded in sparking some inflation, yet its goal of achieving price rises of 2% a year by around April 2015 remains a distant possibility. Along with the government, it badly underestimated the dampening effect of a hike in the consumption tax in April this year, which caused the economy to shrink by 1.7% in the second quarter. Because of faltering consumer and corporate demand, and falling oil prices, inflation is now heading in the wrong direction, and may dip beneath 1%.\n\nIn recent weeks, economists had started to question Mr Kuroda\u2019s oft-stated commitment to banishing Japan\u2019s entrenched deflationary psychology. They suggested that the bank\u2019s formerly conservative mindset might even be returning. Mr Kuroda\u2019s predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, pursued monetary easing only half-heartedly, and achieved little. Meanwhile, Mr Kuroda had sought to stealthily extend the deadline for exiting deflation. That did little to reassure that Abenomics was on track in spite of stalled growth and sluggish inflation. Upon announcing the additional easing, Mr Kuroda admitted that matters had reached a \u201ccritical point\u201d, as the bank\u2019s efforts were losing momentum.\n\nNow a fresh round of no-holds-barred QE will immediately boost Mr Abe\u2019s economic plan. The Nikkei stock index\u2014a vital gauge of success for the government\u2014rose to its highest level in seven years on the news. The yen lurched further downwards, which will help import inflation. In addition to the tidings from the central bank, there was still more sugar on offer for equity markets. The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest, said it would slash its holdings of government bonds from 60% to 35% in order to buy more shares. The strength of the co-ordination between the government, the BoJ and the ministry of labour, health and welfare, which oversees the GPIF, surprised observers. After the GPIF\u2019s changes, most economists had not expected further monetary easing until 2015.\n\nThe BoJ\u2019s action this week also took markets aback because in recent public appearances Mr Kuroda had stuck to a bullish economic outlook. Yet on October 31st the BoJ halved its forecast for economic growth for the 2014 fiscal year to 0.5%. The bank also made its timeframe for achieving 2% inflation open-ended, removing its two-year deadline. Nonetheless, following the additional easing, the central bank still expects to meet its inflation target in 2015. As well as buying an additional \u00a530 trillion of JGBs a year, the BoJ will also purchase more risky assets in the form of exchange-traded funds and investment trusts in Japanese property.\n\nA motivation for Mr Kuroda\u2014in addition to visibly slowing inflation and weak growth\u2014may have been an intensifying political debate over whether or not Mr Abe should again raise the unpopular consumption tax from 8% to 10% in 2015. The BoJ is strongly in favour of a second hike in order to repair Japan\u2019s stretched public finances. More monetary easing should encourage Mr Abe to press ahead.\n\nBut this latest round of QE is not without its detractors. In April 2013 the BoJ\u2019s nine-strong policy board voted unanimously in favour of its radical new monetary drive, this time it revealed a rare split. Four members voted against the expansion of monetary easing, which came just two days after America\u2019s Federal Reserve ended its third round of QE. It is unclear whether or not the dissenters disagreed with the extra stimulus itself, or merely with its timing. This week\u2019s further easing will intensify the worries around the policy announced last spring. Chief among these is that QE will be hard to exit without alarming the bond market. Yet for the time being, Mr Kuroda is waging a more dogged fight against deflation. The prospect of Japanese \u201ctapering\u201d is ever more distant.",

Bradley, the magazine's owner, on Tuesday and accepted it and resigned from The Times today. He said he expected to start at his new job in about two weeks.\n\nMr. Bennet's appointment was announced to the staff late this afternoon.\n\nA graduate of Yale, Mr. Bennet held an editing post at The Washington Monthly from 1989 to 1991 but otherwise has devoted his career to writing. He briefly resigned from The Times in 2003 for a job at The New Yorker but before starting decided he was not ready to leave the newspaper and continued at his post in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Atlantic has been searching for an editor since last April, when Mr. Bradley announced that he was moving it from its 149-year-old home in Boston to Washington. The magazine has been in some turmoil since, with many staff members in Boston deciding to stay there, and with Mr. Bradley hiring several writers on his own and rebuilding the operation in Washington, all without an editor at the top. In a sign of the flux, the current issue carries no masthead at all.\n\nMr. Bennet is the magazine's first official editor since Mr. Kelly stepped down in September 2002 to return to writing. Before Mr. Bradley had named a replacement, Mr. Kelly was killed in Iraq on assignment for the magazine. Cullen Murphy, the managing editor, oversaw The Atlantic without the title of editor; once the magazine's move to Washington was announced, he tapered off his duties. Scott Stossel became managing editor and handled the move, which is now virtually complete.\n\nMr. Bennet said he accepted the offer because \"it's a chance to help, encourage and preserve the practice of serious, long-form journalism and a chance to work with great writers and editors.\" He said that because of the \"uncertain time\" for print journalism, \"this kind of undertaking is more important than it's been.\"\n\nMr. Bradley said he selected Mr. Bennet, whom he first met through a mutual friend eight years ago, after a lengthy listening tour in which he talked to 80 leading journalists about his search for \"extreme talent\" and the mission for The Atlantic.\n\nHe said Mr. Bennet had \"lived life near the headlines,\" had excelled at long-form narratives, and had a \"selfless nature.\"\n\nBill Keller, executive editor of The Times, said he hated losing Mr. Bennet and called him \"an extraordinary talent \u0097 voraciously curious, an original thinker and a dazzling writer.\"\n\n\"He'll have to slow his heartbeat to the pace of a monthly, which may be frustrating for a guy so deeply engaged in the news, but it's a brilliant choice,\" Mr. Keller said. \"His name on the masthead will be enough to make me grab for the magazine.\"\n\nMr. Bennet was to become the paper's Beijing correspondent later this year and has been in language training since November.",

You've seen the camouflage development mules. You've seen the interior. You've learned about its hybrid drivetrain and how much power its packing.\n\nToday, you will learn that the McLaren P1 supercar will accelerate from 0-62mph in \"less than three seconds\" and on to a limited top speed of 218mph. Fast, no?\n\nThat's not all. McLaren has revealed more acceleration details with which you can arm yourself in the inevitable Discussing Which Supercar Is Best In The Pub On Friday Night With Friends game (deluxe edition). The P1 will sprint from 0-124mph (0-200km/h) in less than seven seconds, and go from 0-186mph (0-300km/h) in 17 seconds. McLaren rightly informs us that last benchmark is some nine seconds quicker than the old McLaren F1.\n\nTo provide you with some perspective, the Porsche 918 Spyder is estimated to hit 62mph in under three seconds and 124mph in around eight seconds, while a Bugatti Veyron SS \u2013 the 1,183bhp orange merchant of speed \u2013 hits 124mph from rest in 7.3 seconds and 186mph in 15 seconds dead. So despite McLaren's claims that the P1 was never meant to be the fastest outright, it's clearly no slouch.\n\nProduction is limited to 375 models only, combining \u2013 as you know \u2013 a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 to an electric motor to provide 903bhp. And because it's a hybrid, emissions (combined) sit below 200g/km of CO2. There are also DRS and IPAS technologies on board to ally it closely with the company's Formula 1 activity. This is good.\n\nPirelli has been working with McLaren on the tires too, and has developed a special compound for the P1, probably something a little bit less rubbish than the F1 tire TopGear.com made in Turkey. Ahem.\n\nAnd here's one of the best bits about the P1. We're told the brakes are akin to those on a GT3 racer, developed by Akebono and featuring a new kind of carbon ceramic disc, previously used in space. Space!\n\nSadly, for us mere mortals, the price is equally cosmic.

And that, counter-intuitively, could have been bad news for their health.\n\nA recent study in the British Medical Journal showed that cycling has a positive health impact around 77 times larger than the potential for serious injury; essentially, there\u2019s a small chance that you\u2019ll come a cropper, but a very large chance that you\u2019ll reduce your likelihood of suffering mental illness, heart disease and obesity. That means the laws were hugely counterproductive; they reduced cycling injuries, but only by reducing the number of cyclists, and those people then became more likely to come to some other kind of less-dramatic and tangible harm. Clearly, if this was an acceptable approach then we could easily slash injuries by 100 per cent simply by banning bicycles.\n\nThe CTC, the UK\u2019s largest cycling charity, has long argued against mandatory helmet laws for a similar reason. It claims they would make cycling seem more dangerous than it actually is, putting people off. \u201cThe evidence on this question is complex and contradictory, providing as much support for those who are deeply sceptical of helmets as for those who swear by them,\u201d it says.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of enforcing new laws. In the first year after the Australian State of Victoria made helmets mandatory there were 19,229 Bicycle Offence Penalty Notices issued. Do we want to tie up that much police time on a crime which has no negative impact on a third party? South Africa made helmets mandatory, then couldn\u2019t agree on exactly how to enforce it, so never did.\n\nThere's even evidence that wearing a helmet can put you at more risk. A 2006 study by Jeff Brewster from the University of Bath found that drivers passed closer to cyclists wearing a helmet when overtaking than they did those without them. The driver's subconscious sees them as less vulnerable and therefore less worthy of a wide berth.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that mandatory safety devices such as motorbike helmets and seatbelts in cars have been lifesavers on a huge scale. But neither had the same potential for harmful side-effects: dissuade motorcyclists from riding and they\u2019ll buy a car, which is actually far safer (if less fun). Meanwhile, there is virtually nothing that will discourage drivers.\n\nPersonally, I believe that wearing a helmet has more pros than cons, even though cycling is not as risky as many would have you believe. But there are those out there who would rather not ride than be made to wear a helmet, and for that reason the idea is a non-starter.",

Now, thanks to the unlikely sex champion Bill Gates, graphene could be used to make the thinnest, lightest, most impenetrable condom ever conceived.\n\n\u201cThe common analogy is that wearing a condom is like taking a shower with a raincoat on,\u201d says Dr Papa Salif Sow, senior program officer on the HIV team at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has awarded $100,000 (\u00a360,000) to scientists at the University of Manchester's National Graphene Institute to aid their pursuit of the ultimate super-sheath. \u201cA redesigned condom that overcomes inconvenience, fumbling or perceived loss of pleasure would be a powerful weapon in the fight against poverty.\u201d\n\nAt only one atom thick, an all-graphene condom would put the Durex Ultra Thin to shame \u2013 although the fact that the material is barely visible to the naked eye could lead to some awkward moments between the sheets. A slight ruffle of the duvet and could it just float away?\n\nDr Aravind Vijayaraghavan, who will lead the research team, explains the focus is on developing a composite material, with latex, \u201ctailored to enhance the natural sensation during intercourse while using a condom, which should encourage and promote condom use.\u201d\n\nIt will be achieved, he says, \u201cby combining the strength of graphene with the elasticity of latex to produce a new material which can be thinner, stronger, more stretchy, safer and, perhaps most importantly, more pleasurable.\u201d\n\nBut Vijayaraghavan and his colleagues are not alone in their pursuit. The Gates Foundation has declared it will give out a total of $1m in grants to secure a next-generation condom that \u201csignificantly preserves or enhances pleasure\u201d \u2013 and there is no shortage of competitors.\n\nResearchers at the University of Oregon are using their grant to develop an ultra-thin polyurethane polymer condom with \u201cshape memory\u201d properties, that would vacuum-seal around the penis as it heated up during intercourse. The body heat generated during sex would make the condom\u2019s molecules retract, creating a snug fit twice as thin as the normal latex variety. If shrink-wrapping your manpiece isn't enough, it comes embedded with antimicrobial nanoparticles, to guard against sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nIf this all sounds too techy, then perhaps Mark McGlothlin, of Apex Medical Technologies in San Diego, has the answer. \u201cA lot of people are trying to get stronger and thinner material \u2013 that was always my focus,\u201d he told the New Republic. But why innovate, when the material already exists \u2013 in the form of collagen fibrils from cow tendons. After all, didn't people manage for centuries with sheep intestines? \u201cThe texture of collagen is very much like the mucous membrane,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feel of it, the heat transfer of it, and to the touch, it feels very much like skin.\u201d\n\nMcGlothlin plans to source his beef tendon from a Chinese food store in California, but he says that slaughterhouses, or even fish markets, are other potential sources. Next time you're at the butchers, you might think twice before turning your nose up at that bag of offal.",

        "text": "Walpole Old Chapel, Suffolk. Christopher Stell wrote despairingly to its trustees when they were planning to sell it. Photograph: Historic Chapels Trust\n\nChristopher Stell, who has died aged 84 from kidney failure, was recently described as the \"doyen of nonconformist architectural historians\". His reputation in this field was established by his weighty four-volume Inventory of Nonconformist Chapels and Meeting Houses in England that appeared between 1986 and 2002.\n\nThe architecture of religious dissent in England is sometimes modest and deliberately self-effacing, especially those places of worship built by the Quakers and the earlier Congregational and Unitarian groups. But from the 19th century nonconformity often produced well-appointed buildings, proud to assert differences from established religion in their architecture. All seek to bear testimony to centuries of religious diversity in England since nonconformist worship was first made conditionally lawful in 1689. Yet architectural (and other) historians have been slow to catch up and, until Stell's inventory, too often ignored the majority of places of worship in Britain \u2013 that is, those that are not Anglican.\n\nIn particular, Stell's work highlighted the many serious omissions in the Pevsner Architectural Guides of that time, with the inventory itself becoming a \"Pevsner for nonconformism\". Like his predecessor, Stell visited each site by car. Unlike Nikolaus Pevsner, he drove himself and also recorded the buildings with photographs, careful scale drawings and sometimes sketches. It was a marathon task and his family became used to his absence throughout the week.\n\nIt is a testimony to his work that the revised Buildings of England volumes of today do list and discuss nonconformist places of worship with far greater seriousness.\n\nStell was born and brought up in Liverpool, the son of a PE teacher, and read architecture at Liverpool University's School of Architecture. Completing his training, he resolved to be a building historian and early writing quickly established his credentials as an accomplished self-taught researcher.\n\nSo many chapels and meeting houses have been demolished since the second world war, especially in those working-class communities where the once thriving \"co-op and chapel culture\" has collapsed in recent decades. Their entry in his inventory has become their obituary. Many have been converted to other uses which at least preserves the chapel outlines in the English landscape; but the photos in the inventory poignantly show the lost interiors.\n\nIn 1988 Stell helped found the Chapels Society which has pioneered serious study of this neglected area. When he heard that Walpole Old Chapel in Suffolk was to be sold off he wrote to its trustees: \"It truly amazes me that any denomination should wish to dispose itself of one of the finest and oldest and most richly evocative buildings in its care. To dispose of a worn-out building is one thing. To disclaim any further interest in the one tangible link with early Suffolk Independency is another.\"\n\nIn fact the church did divest itself of this simple but moving building though happily it went to the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, of which Stell was also a founding spirit and trustee for two decades.\n\nStell was trustee of the Ancient Monuments Society for 30 years and attended every one of the annual Vernacular Architecture Group meeting for 50 years. He personally rescued a partly 17th-century stone house in Calderdale intended for demolition, which he bought for \u00a350. He got it listed and adapted it with the absolute minimum of modernisation, long before such a domestic style became fashionable.\n\nAlways modest but meticulous in his scholarship, he quietly appreciated the recognition of an OBE in 1989 and the fact that his work was the first port of call for younger scholars. A lifelong Baptist, he enjoyed the Athenaeum \u2013 traditionally better known for the Anglican bishops among its members \u2013 for Stell was a champion of religious dissent who felt confident in the corridors of power.\n\nMany will remember his astonishing recall for buildings he had last seen 20 or 30 years previously, his endless curiosity and his dapper hats. Sometimes he wore a brown bowler, sometimes a deerstalker \u2013 for he loved Conan Doyle stories, as only a meticulous detective of buildings would.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jean, whom he married in 1957, and their sons, John and Edward.\n\n\u2022 Christopher Stell, architectural historian, born 26 January 1929; died 16 January 2014",

With Sterling's ouster, the Clippers suddenly became the most attractive team in town to wealthy fans lining up for an unlikely chance to seize control of a Hollywood sports franchise on the move.\n\nDavid Carter, the executive director of USC's Sports Business Institute, identifies multiple factors contributing to the Clippers' extraordinary value.\n\n\"Interest in the team results from the combination of NBA teams being rare assets that are seldom available for purchase, the location of this particular team, and potential owners' belief that revenue streams linked to rehabbing the brand and participating in future revenue linked to a new TV deal all make the team very attractive to prospective buyers,\" Carter said.\n\nCombs, Rick Ross and Snoop Dogg all aired their interest, as did longtime Clippers fan Frankie Muniz and Damon, who told CNBC he'd like to be a \"super-tiny minority investor.\" Fans also got in on the frenzy, opening campaigns on Kickstarter and Crowdtilt to pool their resources for the club.\n\nA vocal segment of the NBA's social media following immediately started a campaign to move the Clippers to Seattle, a basketball-loving city that has been without a team since Clay Bennett moved the SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008.\n\nThe Clippers' association with Sterling's racist remarks could have been crushing to their prestige and value, but they don't seem to be a problem if Sterling is no longer associated with the club.\n\nThe Clippers have captured the imagination of Los Angeles' counterculture, the transplants and contrarian fans who aren't interested in the Lakers' bandwagon.

        "text": "We swim in an ocean of feedback. It\u2019s not just those performance reviews at work. It\u2019s your reflection in the mirror, the comment your spouse made at breakfast, or the accusatory note you just found in your mailbox from your neighbor.\n\nRecent research that suggests that how you react to that feedback \u2014 whether you take it in stride or get flattened by it \u2014 is due at least in part to your wiring. When it comes to sensitivity to feedback, individuals can vary up to three thousand percent in terms of how far they swing, emotionally, and how long it takes them to recover. And that has profound implications for their ability to hear the feedback they get, and to learn anything from it.\n\nTake Alita. She has been highly sensitive to criticism since she was a child. Now an accomplished obstetrician, her skills and confidence have matured, yet her sensitivity to feedback is just as strong as it was when she was young. \u201cThree years ago we did patient satisfaction surveys,\u201d Alita explains. \u201cMy patients love the attention I give them, and my reviews were largely positive. Yet there were a few comments from patients frustrated that I sometimes run late.\u201d She adds, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt the same way about my practice since.\u201d\n\nWhile Alita knows intellectually that these are a few negative comments among many, and that, in fact, it\u2019s the attention that she gives each patient that causes her to run late, this doesn\u2019t change her emotional reaction to the feedback itself.\n\nSound familiar? If you\u2019re like Alita, you\u2019ve probably been hearing the same advice for much of your life: \u201cDon\u2019t be so sensitive,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d \u201cYou need to get a thicker skin.\u201d Yet new research suggests that this is far harder for some than others.\n\nThree factors can be used to measure our sensitivity to feedback. The first is Baseline, which measures your general state of happiness or contentment. In the wake of positive or negative events (or feedback), we all tend to gravitate back toward our baseline. Some people have a relatively high baseline \u2013 like Elaine in the next cubicle who always seems so (gratingly) cheerful no matter how much pressure the team is under. Others \u2014 like Mortimer down in purchasing \u2014 may have a relatively low happiness baseline, perpetually dissatisfied with their lives (and with you), regardless of how well things may be going.\n\nThe second variable is Swing \u2014 how far up or down you go as a result of positive or negative feedback. Someone with small swing is \u201ceven keeled\u201d: Nothing excites them much, and few things really get them too upset. If you swing wider emotionally, your ups and downs will be more intense and you\u2019ll require less stimulation to move you off your baseline.\n\nAnd finally, Sustain or Recovery, which measures how long it takes you to return to your baseline. How long do you sustain a bounce in your step in the wake of an appreciative email from an important customer? How long does it take you to recover from the public dressing down you got from your boss on the newsroom floor? Recent findings from neuro-imaging show that positive and negative swing and recovery can operate independently. If you have small swing and short sustain on positive feedback, and wide swing and long recovery on the negatives, that\u2019s a tough combination. Positive feedback disappears quickly, while negative feedback hits you hard and keeps you down for a good long while.\n\nThis is Alita\u2019s profile, and it\u2019s why she finds critical feedback \u2013 even well-intended \u201csuggestions\u201d from patients about how to better manage her time \u2013 so upsetting. Rather than prompting her to improve service or better manage her appointments, it paralyzes and demotivates her. Her head delivery nurse, Toni, has the opposite profile; she\u2019s unflappable in the face of stressful events, and she can shrug off even angry attacks within minutes.\n\nThe good news for Alita is that wiring is only part of the equation. Researchers estimate that it accounts for about 40% of how we react, and whether it\u2019s a little more or a little less doesn\u2019t matter. The bigger point is that a significant part of how we react to negative feedback is not from wiring, but rather, results from the story we tell ourselves about what the feedback means.\n\nIn other words, our own upset can cause us to distort the feedback we receive. For example, say someone tells you that you were singing off-key \u2014 it\u2019s about your singing, of this song, this time. But through the lens of upset, the feedback is supersized: \u201cI must always sing off key and no one tells me. I can never do anything right. I\u2019m a loser and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\nAlita is doing a version of this when she dwells on the one or two complaints about keeping patients waiting and ignores all the comments from patients who adore her. Given her wiring, she is easily upset, but she\u2019s compounding the problem by telling a story that incapacitates her. Her reaction to the feedback is blocking her ability to learn from it.\n\nWe can all learn to manage feedback more skillfully by learning how to see the feedback at \u201cactual size.\u201d Feedback should be bound in time (feedback about right now is not about the future) and by specificity (feedback about one thing is not about everything) and by size (needing to improve by 10% is different from needing to improve by 80%).\n\nUnderstanding our own triggered reactions to feedback can help us all regain our footing, and turn even upsetting feedback into something we can work with, and use to grow.",
        "generated": "Research suggests that people's sensitivity to feedback can vary greatly, with some individuals being highly sensitive and others being less so, and that this sensitivity can affect their ability to learn from feedback.",
        "summary": "Your emotional wiring plays a critical role in how you react to feedback -- both good and bad -- from others. But you can override those instincts by learning how to frame the input you receive."

        "text": "Detail from Artemisia Gentileschi's Susanna and the Elders (1610). Click for full image\n\nRevealing the history of female artists on television may sound an easy project, a delightful exercise in heritage tourism. Haven't we moved beyond a worthy roundup of forgotten heroines, hidden from history? After all, feminist art history has been investigating the female gaze since Linda Nochlin asked \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" in 1971. Magisterial surveys and text books have come since, from Germaine Greer's The Obstacle Race (1979) to Griselda Pollock and Rozika Parker's Old Mistresses (1991), enabling art history degrees to offer courses on gender and \"ways of seeing\" for the last 20 years or so. Engaging TV on the subject of this debate would be easy, I blithely presumed, until I embarked on the simple but fundamental task of seeing female art for myself.\n\nIs art male? Most institutions would have us think so. The disparities are startling. In 1989 the feminist Guerrilla Girls discovered that fewer than 5% of the modern works in the Metropolitan Museum in New York were by women, but 85% of the nudes were female. It is usually possible to see works by one or two women in an entire museum, but you could spend hours looking. I was relieved to find Judith Leyster's tiny but spell-binding Proposition (1631) and Clara Peeters' genre-defining Still Life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels (1621) in the Hague's Gemeentemuseum.\n\nEven Artemisia Gentileschi's masterpiece Judith Beheading Holofernes (1620) has only been exhibited in the Uffizi since 2000. A Medici duchess had banished Gentileschi's assassination scene to a dark corridor, finding her \"blood work\" too grisly for display.\n\nWeeks of negotiation and an Italian fixer got me into the Vasari corridor to film. This kilometre walkway snakes from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace, crossing the Arno over the Ponte Vecchio. Built in 1564, it allowed the Medici to travel unmolested between their palace and government offices. It is lined with self-portraits by artists, a pantheon of art history from the 16th century onwards. But of the 1,700 self-portraits only 7% are by women.\n\nDid women not paint, sculpt or craft? Or were female efforts so third-rate they did not earn the wall space? The absence of a celebrated female pantheon contrasts starkly with women's success in literature. But the requirements of authorship were far easier to fulfil than the demands of art. Writing required only literacy, access to a library and a desk. Even the risky exposure of publication could be offset by anonymity. By contrast, art demanded complex training, public production and was enmeshed in a well-guarded infrastructure. Unyielding social prejudices, prohibitions on formal training and legal restrictions on female commerce hobbled the woman artist.\n\nI was prepared for a hunt, but nevertheless the near invisibility of women's art was shocking: I was forced into storage facilities and basements. The Advancing Women Artists Foundation estimates that 1,500 works by women are currently stored in Florence's various deposits, most of which have not been on public view for centuries. To the question \"Are all of these works of a high artistic standard?\" Jane Fortune, head of the foundation, answers: \"We'll never know unless they are seen.\"\n\nPublic galleries seem tacitly to endorse the conservative view, exemplified by Brian Sewell's assertion that \"only men are capable of aesthetic greatness\". But painters and sculptors were artisans working within family-based workshops, just like tailors, locksmiths, goldsmiths and cabinetmakers. Art was a trade. Few paintings were the product of a single hand \u2013 only the face and hands might be the work of the \"master\". The male artist's brand was a fiction. Marietta Tintoretto worked alongside her father in Venice, Barbara Longhi beside her brother in Ravenna, their labour a vital constituent of the family economy, but unrecognised outside the workshop.\n\nA deep belief in the impossibility of female genius is at work. Many of Leyster's sunny canvases celebrating the social life of the Dutch golden age were so skilful they were attributed to Frans Hals, despite her signature.\n\nThe Bolognese Elisabetta Sirani produced more than 200 pieces in a 13-year career, garnering international acclaim for her smooth religious art. She ran the family workshop that embraced her sisters, supported her father when he could no longer paint and established an art school for young girls. The very accomplishment, speed and fluency of her art, however, laid her open to the accusation that she could not have created it \u2013 a man must have helped her \u2013 an accusation she saw off by staging live demonstrations of her painting.\n\nGentileschi could match the men of counter-reformation art, but chose to dramatise the struggles of women. She depicted the same heroines, even repeating the scenes of her father Orazio, but she charged hers with a pungent critique of male possession of women. The violence of voyeurism is palpable in her Susanna and the Elders (1610), when the cowering woman is victim to the lecherous gaze of two old men. They will accuse her of the capital crime of adultery unless she agrees to sleep with them. Her strong twisting body is displayed, but her horror is uppermost, and her arms are raised in resistance. \"What are YOU looking at?\" the painting says to us. Compare this with Tintoretto's titillating version in which Susanna seems to know she is being watched and exhibits her white nakedness in an obliging soft performance. The episode becomes a pretext for erotica, and as the woman is complicit in her own subjugation, the dirt of sexual oppression is whitewashed away. Gentileschi will have none of it.\n\nIt is not my purpose to suggest that we have yet to discover a female Michelangelo, but it is misleading to look at the past through the eyes of men alone. What women saw was different. Let's remember that.\n\n\u2022 The Story of Women and Art continues on BBC2 on 23 and 30 May.",

The Dow Jones MENA index (\u201cMENA\u201d is an acronym for Middle East-North Africa and usually means the Arab countries and sometimes Turkey) plummeted from 558 in late 2010 to a low of 460 in March. Lately it\u2019s been around 470. The S&P Pan Arab Composite Index is down about 13% on the year. The stock market of Egypt, the region\u2019s most populous country, was closed for 55 days during tumult there early this year. The EGX 30 stock index has fallen about 40% on the year from about 7000 to 4000 currently. The index had stabilized around 4500 before crowds returned to Tahrir Square late in November to protest moves by the Egyptian army to consolidate its control in advance of the first round of parliamentary elections. Roubini Global Economics estimates foreign direct investment in Egypt, only about $6 billion in the 2009-2010 fiscal year, has dropped by 68%.\n\nA bet on oil or on people?\n\nFor the hardy investors who have stayed in the region, their investments in MENA countries boil down to either a bet on the price of oil and natural gas produced mainly by the Persian Gulf states (Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates), or a bet on the demographics of the more densely populated countries of north Africa \u2013 Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, several of which (Egypt, for instance) are net oil importers.\n\nThe World Bank expects the MENA region to grow 3.6% in 2011, mostly from gains by big oil producers of the Gulf. (Before the fall of longtime governments in Tunisia and Egypt the World Bank had predicted 5% growth.) Javier Cervino, a partner in Isthmus Partners, a financial consultancy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, says the Gulf economy has stabilized over the last year or so. Real estate investment in Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. has stabilized and telecoms like Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mobily and Qatar\u2019s Qtel have done well lately. \u201cFrom our point of view the events in Syria and Egypt seem as far away as they would to someone in New York,\u201d Cervino adds. Less explosive but still simmering political conflict in Bahrain, he says, was more urgent to Gulf investors.\n\nOil roars back to $100, but does anybody care?\n\nThe investment argument for the North African countries is based on their large, youthful and in many places well-educated populations. This huge pool of workers, consumers and entrepreneurs wants jobs and income to spend on themselves and their families. That means economic growth and thus opportunity for investors who can supply the capital \u2014 and are willing to take the risks that come with investing in \u201cfrontier\u201d markets, many of which lack stock exchanges or trustworthy legal systems.\n\nThe big problem is that the despots and monarchs who have long dominated Arab politics (recent moves toward economic liberalization over the last few years aside) don\u2019t want to give up either political or economic control of their countries. Neither do the countless bureaucrats and officials who rely on payoffs and kickbacks from business people. One of the initial sparks for the Arab Spring was the leak of a cable in which a U.S. diplomat commented that \u201cseemingly half \u201c the business elite of Tunisia were members of President Ben Ali\u2019s family. The Arab Spring began in earnest when the old politics of governments being able to buy off their populations with public sector jobs and subsidies finally collapsed.\n\nEgypt is the test case for the Arab Spring, politically and economically. It is the Arab world\u2019s most populous country and it has the most diversified economy and most mature financial institutions. Other North African economies that have had their own revolutions this year are either too small (Tunisia) or too badly damaged (Libya) to be candidates for much outside investment any time soon.\n\nEgypt is the largest Middle Eastern economy where it is comparatively easy for outsiders to invest; in Saudi Arabia, by contrast, foreigners from outside the Gulf cannot directly own publically traded Saudi equities. Not that the Egyptian stock exchange is anywhere as large or liquid as London or Tokyo\u2019s. Brian Bandsma, a senior analyst with the investment management firm Vontobel, went to Cairo to scope out possible investments in 2010. He saw a few public companies that impressed him but the firm decided not to buy any of them because they were too thinly traded.\n\nAli Tarhouni: A Libyan leader speaks out\n\nWestern investors, who cheered the revolution, have yet to embrace Egypt as an investment opportunity, largely because of political uncertainty that is, in turn, paralyzing the country\u2019s economy. Even before clashes between protestors and the army broke out in November, tourism, a crucial industry, had ground to a halt. When revolution broke out in neighboring Libya, the many Egyptians who worked in that country\u2019s oil industry either came home or stopped sending money to their families. Egyptian unemployment, already high before the Arab Spring, has risen to about 40%.\n\nEfforts by the Egyptian Central Bank to support the Egyptian pound and head off inflation had the side effect of making it possible for skittish investors to liquidate their Egyptian investments and take their money out of the country without getting killed on the exchange rate. Meanwhile, the bank\u2019s reserves have been nearly depleted and it was widely expected that Egypt, which rejected an International Monetary Fund loan in June, would have to make some kind of deal with the IMF within the next few months.\n\nAnd those are the things investors know about; what\u2019s really keeping institutions out of Egypt are countless unknown factors: What role will the military, which controls a sizable chunk of the country\u2019s real estate, ultimately play in the governing of Egypt? How will the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and other parties fare in major elections? (Elections for the lower house of parliament began in late November to be followed by elections for the upper house and for a new president in spring 2012.)\n\nMichael Daoud, head of Middle East equities at Auerbach Grayson, a New York brokerage specializing in the Middle East, says given all the uncertainty there\u2019s just no way to know when foreign capital will return to Egypt and other parts of the region that have been thrust into turmoil by the Arab Spring. He\u2019s more bullish on Egypt than many: he is tracking stable companies such as Juhayna Food Industries, which dominates the Egyptian market for milk and dairy products; energy products and services supplier Elsewedy Electric, and Cairo-based CIB Bank.\n\nStill, he can\u2019t recommend that an interested foreign investor rush out and buy stakes in those companies. Not now, Daoud says. Things won\u2019t start to get clearer until the election returns start to come in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be a little late,\u201d he says, \u201cthan too early.\u201d\n\nMore Fortune Investor\u2019s Guide 2012\n\n10 best stocks for 2012\n\nThe triumph of Blackstone on Wall Street\n\nNew global hot spots for investors\n\nRamit Sethi: The new finance guru on the block\n\nWhere to put your money now\n\nThe best and worst of Wall Street 2011\n\nBeing a boring investor \u2026 and loving it\n\nCan Wall Street thrive again?",

        "text": "When billionaire investor William Ackman organized a widely publicized conference call a year ago, he said it would prove that Herbalife Ltd. was operating a pyramid scheme in China in violation of local laws.\n\nThe March 2014 event was another jab in the long-running fight between the two sides, a saga that has seen wild turns in Herbalife\u2019s stock and left Wall Street scratching its head about who is right.\n\nOne year later, the debate about Herbalife\u2019s operations in China and Mr. Ackman\u2019s $1 billion bet against the company rages on. Now, federal prosecutors have begun to look at the presentation as part of their probe into potential market manipulation of Herbalife\u2019s stock, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nDocuments reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, and also separately provided to prosecutors, paint a complicated picture of Herbalife\u2019s business model in China. Hundreds of pages of research notes and transcripts of interviews with Herbalife distributors in China describe confusing and at times contradictory explanations of Herbalife\u2019s compensation model. This information, in part, underpinned Mr. Ackman\u2019s March presentation, along with information from Herbalife\u2019s federal securities\u2019 disclosures and internal documents.\n\nMr. Ackman said during the presentation that the work proved Herbalife is paying its distributors commissions on sales from downstream recruits, in violation of Chinese law, and that the system is deliberately vague in order to mask its true nature as a pyramid scheme.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price fell about 1.2% on the day of Mr. Ackman\u2019s presentation.\n\nThe company has denied all of Mr. Ackman\u2019s allegations. It says it is in full compliance with Chinese law and that regulators there haven\u2019t taken any action against the company. Herbalife says the compensation model is different from the one used in other countries, set to an hourly pay scale in order to comply with China\u2019s strict laws governing multilevel marketing companies. Distributors submit hour logs and invoices to document their work, the company says.\n\nAs previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office and New York field office of the FBI are investigating whether people, including some hired by Mr. Ackman, made false statements about Herbalife\u2019s business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price. Mr. Ackman\u2019s fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP has said it has acted lawfully and isn\u2019t aware of any false statements made by its contractors.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Herbalife for at least a year. That probe is continuing, as is a related investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that is focused on whether the company\u2019s business practices have violated any securities laws.\n\nHerbalife denies it is a pyramid scheme and says it is cooperating with the investigations.\n\nSpokesmen for the FBI, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, the SEC and the trade commission declined to comment.\n\nThe criminal investigation into potential market manipulation is pursuing multiple lines of inquiry. One area of focus, however, is the work of a consultant, Aaron Smith-Levin, who helped with the March presentation, people familiar with the matter said. He was commissioned by Mr. Ackman and his fund to scrutinize Herbalife\u2019s business in China.\n\nProsecutors have reviewed documents prepared by a researcher in China contracted by Mr. Smith-Levin that were later used during the two-hour webcast organized by Mr. Ackman last March, examining whether false information was spread about Herbalife in the presentation, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nNeither Mr. Ackman nor Pershing Square have been served with a subpoena or been visited by FBI agents in connection with the probe, another person familiar with the matter said. The investigation could end with no charges being filed.\n\nIn a statement, Pershing Square said that since the March presentation, it has received additional evidence from former distributors and a former Herbalife China employee that confirms that Herbalife is violating China\u2019s pyramid sales laws.\n\n\u201cHerbalife has yet to provide any evidence that our conclusion is incorrect. Rather, Herbalife has simply stated that our presentation \u2018reflects [a] continued failure to fundamentally understand Herbalife\u2019s business model.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlan Hoffman, a spokesman for Herbalife, said \u201cThe fraudulent China research is yet another example of the lengths to which Mr. Ackman will go in his campaign to manipulate Herbalife shares and enrich himself. We remain confident in the strong fundamentals of our business model and committed to helping people and communities improve their nutrition.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith-Levin said in an interview that it is \u201ctotally normal\u201d to receive contradictory information in the research process and that the notes prosecutors were reviewing didn\u2019t represent the full body of his work. He said he hadn\u2019t been contacted by prosecutors or FBI agents and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMr. Smith-Levin also provided to the Journal hundreds of pages of what he said were translated transcripts of his researcher\u2019s interviews with Herbalife distributors in China. The Wall Street Journal didn\u2019t review the original recordings of the interviews.\n\nAmong the translated transcripts was an Oct. 30, 2013, interview in Guangzhou with an Herbalife distributor identified only as Ms. Chen. During a more than hourlong chat at a coffee shop, the researcher, who had identified herself as a translator traveling to the city on business and not as a researcher, pressed Ms. Chen about Herbalife\u2019s hourly pay system.\n\nMs. Chen said that even when she didn\u2019t earn revenue on direct sales of Herbalife products, she could receive hourly pay from the company. She said she had a developed a \u201cmarket\u201d of 10 in three separate cities, without explaining what a market is.\n\n\u201cThat means [sic] your market\u2019s market will be counted as your market,\u201d the researcher asked. \u201cYes, sure,\u201d Ms. Chen answered, according to the transcripts.\n\n\u201cSo even if you do nothing, you will get paid.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith-Levin would later cite this dialogue as evidence that Ms. Chen was earning commissions on the sales of downline distributors she had recruited, a violation of Chinese law.\n\nBut later in the interview, Ms. Chen appeared to describe actual hourly work for which she was compensated, saying she\u2019d been paid for 11 hours of work the past month.\n\n\u201c[Eleven hours] is the time your staff market spend on building a market, like issuing a card, this is visible,\u201d Ms. Chen said. \u201cHours is not complicated, time spent on issuing a card, and time spend on building a market.\u201d\n\nIn a note inserted into the transcript the researcher wrote, \u201cThis is incorrect data. Ms. Chen doesn\u2019t know how her own hourly consulting fee is calculated.\u201d\n\nProsecutors\u2019 specific interest in the documents remains unclear. They are more generally pursuing potentially false information spread about the company, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMarket manipulation can be difficult to prove. Attempting to discredit a company, even through statements that turn out to be false, isn\u2019t necessarily illegal. Nor is it illegal if such statements were made by someone the person paid. Prosecutors would have to prove a defendant knowingly and willfully made false or deceptive statements, or caused them to be made, in order to manipulate a stock.\n\nWrite to Christopher M.

        "text": "A few weeks ago, a passenger in the cafe car of an Amtrak train near Wilmington, Del., overheard a juicy rumor. A Joe Biden ally was holding phone calls, promising people the vice president was preparing to enter the 2016 campaign. The eavesdropper alerted a reporter, who posted the tidbit online.\n\nIan Miller read the story and knew just what to do. Logging onto a political forecasting website called PredictIt, he quickly bet a few hundred dollars that Biden would enter the race. As Miller expected, the odds soared as the news spread. Then he hedged his bets, placing a wager that Biden wouldn\u2019t run. Soon he had notched a nice profit.\n\nSo it has gone all year for Miller. The 24-year-old high school teacher from the suburbs of Chicago has won online predictions on everything from President Obama\u2019s weekly approval rating (the key: look to historical benchmarks) to the prospects of a U.S. government shutdown to the results of the Israeli elections (he sensed Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party would siphon votes from the far-right). Since depositing $110 in March, Miller is up more than $16,000. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good couple of months,\u201d he says.\n\nWelcome to the new American campaign casino. For the first time in modern history, the average citizen 18 years or older can legally place real-money wagers on politics, in a marketplace approved by federal regulators. The new market for political betting, coupled with the explosion of the multi-billion dollar fantasy-sports industry that was roiled by scandal this week, has raised questions about the spread of online betting markets that have few rules to prevent forms of insider trading.\n\nLike Miller, many of the top speculators on PredictIt are political junkies who win money with a mix of savvy and speed. But PredictIt also allows for those with inside knowledge of future political events\u2014campaign pros, candidate aides or pollsters\u2014to profit as well. \u201cThe risk is that a bunch of people figure they\u2019re not one of the insiders, so they take their ball and go home,\u201d says investor Barry Ritholtz, a critic of prediction markets.\n\nThe danger of market manipulation came into sharp relief this week, as DraftKings and FanDuel, the billion-dollar behemoths of the daily fantasy sports market, were engulfed by reports of insider trading. A content manager for DraftKings placed second in a recent $5 million tournament on rival FanDuel, capturing a $350,000 jackpot that raised questions about possible exploitation of private information. Some employees at the firms have early access to valuable data on the composition of every single roster assembled by its users. An employee could exploit this information by selecting players\u2014for example, a star quarterback who is being under-utilized relative to his value\u2014that would give him the inside lane toward a victory. DraftKings rules barred employees from betting on their own site, but did not forbid betting on rival sites.\n\nBoth sports betting sites released a joint statement Tuesday to respond to the concerns. \u201cEmployees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams, and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, we continue to review our internal controls to ensure they are as strong as they can be.\u201d\n\nOperating on a much smaller scale, PredictIt doesn\u2019t guard against insider trading, though it does bar its employees from trading on the site. Take the betting market on the next majority leader of the House of Representatives. When influential Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan put out a Sept. 28 press release endorsing Georgia Rep. Tom Price for the post, Price\u2019s odds spiked from 15% to 83% in just hours. Anyone with advance knowledge of the press release could have made money. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing we can do,\u201d says Brandi Travis, a PredictIt executive.\n\nSince PredictIt launched in October 2014, its 37,000 members and counting have traded about $9.4 million in shares to date, lodging predictions on everything from whether Republicans will hold the Senate to whether the next U.N. Secretary-General will be a woman. Traders can bet up to $850 per contract, under rules issued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which authorized the project as an academic experiment run under the auspices of a university in New Zealand. (The fantasy sports sites are authorized through separate legislation.) PredictIt is run out of a Capitol Hill political technology firm called Aristotle, which takes a 10% cut of traders\u2019 profits. Aristotle has not disclosed how much it has made from running the program this year, but says it is a tiny percentage of the firm\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nThere have been no specific allegations of insider trading at PredictIt. Outside experts say that the $850 cap on each contract blunts the threat, because the relatively modest sums in play minimize the potential gains. At these stakes, traders are \u201creally doing it for fun and excitement,\u201d says economist David Rothschild of Microsoft Research, who was written extensively about the merits of prediction markets. \u201cThat cap will actually help PredictIt ward off\u201d such threats, Rothschild suggests. For those who study market theory, the input of traders with special knowledge is a feature, not a bug, because it should enhance the market\u2019s collective wisdom and thereby sharpen its accuracy.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the U.S. has experimented with campaign casinos. Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, Wall Street traders bet openly on election futures, with odds advertised in newspapers. In 1916, the equivalent of more than $165 million in today\u2019s dollars was wagered on the contest between Woodrow Wilson and Charles Hughes. But regulators eventually cracked down as abuses grew.\n\nIn recent years, U.S. users flocked to an Ireland-based platform called Intrade, a favorite of Wall Street investors that ultimately collapsed after it ran afoul of U.S. regulators. Intrade reported $230 million in bets on the 2012 campaign. The site underlined the promise and perspicacity of prediction markets; traders even forecasted events like the surprise capture of Saddam Hussein. But also showcased potential pitfalls. Late in the 2012 presidential election, a deep-pocketed trader began making huge bets that Mitt Romney would defeat Barack Obama, even as polls and most handicappers forecast that Obama would win re-election relatively easily. In all, the anonymous trader, who became known as the \u201cRomney Whale,\u201d poured an estimated $4 million into a bet that Romney would prevail. As a result, Intrade pegged the Republican\u2019s chances of prevailing much higher than the polls. The massive sum suggested to some observers that the Romney Whale was trying to manipulate a market that voters and many pundits came to regard as a better barometer than the polls.\n\nAfter watching Intrade\u2019s collapse, PredictIt went in a different direction, opting for a smaller scale and embracing constraints that would help its chances of winning approval from U.S. regulators. It is patterned after a tiny election market that has operated since 1993 out of the University of Iowa. The new site has become a touchstone for presidential campaign staffers, who consider its handicapping more accurate than early polling. Travis says Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign staff have told her they assuage nervous donors by pointing to Bush\u2019s odds on PredictIt, where he currently ranks as the second likeliest Republican nominee behind Marco Rubio.\n\nFortune favors the trader who is quick to the draw. Daniel Kaseff, a 19-year-old George Washington University sophomore, parlayed an initial $20 deposit into more than $7,000 in part by just staying glued to a computer. Kaseff was interning in the U.S. Senate this summer when he learned that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin was going to oppose the Obama Administration\u2019s Iran deal. He used that knowledge to make around $400 before the market adjusted to the news. \u201cThe way to do well on the site is not actually predicting, but being faster than other people,\u201d Kaseff says.\n\nMembership skews young and male, with plenty of Wall Street traders and others, like Miller, whose prediction formulas rely on quantitative modeling. Miller has also learned to separate his head from his heart. For now, he\u2019s happy to make a few bucks off Biden\u2019s indecision. But he\u2019s voting for Hillary Clinton in the end.\n\nThis story has been updated to note that PredictIt employees are prohibited from trading on the site.",

The site has attracted a dedicated following of political junkies and has been praised for its accuracy in predicting election outcomes.

A more recent report in 2000 by the U.S. Bureau of Justice that\u2019s cited by the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) found that 34.2% of sexual assaults of juveniles were committed by family members, and 58.7% of minor victims are attacked by an acquaintance.\n\nThe corruption of a childhood fantasy\u2014what little girl doesn\u2019t dream of growing up to be a Disney princess?\u2014brings the true horror of domestic sexual abuse to light.

        "text": "The removal of the Start menu in Windows 8 prompted a public outcry. Previously used by millions of users as their first point of access to all software, the Start button was replaced with a shortcut to Microsoft's mobile interface, featuring 'live tiles' optimised for touch-based computing.\n\nWith Windows 10, Microsoft has brought back the Start menu, featuring a list of most-used applications and some shortcuts to settings and power functions. By clicking on 'All Programs,' users can browse the full list of applications stored on their PC or device, just as they can on Windows 7.\n\nIt is now possible to navigate using a letter grid. Users can click on a letter to jump to a list of applications beginning with that letter, rather than trawling through the whole list.\n\nAlso included on the right hand side of the Start menu is a customisable panel featuring live tiles. These tiles can be repositioned, resized, pinned and unpinned, just as they could in Windows 8.\n\nThe advantage of this panel, according to Microsoft, is that users can create shortcuts to applications dowloaded from the Windows Store. They can also get a snapshot of what is going on inside any app. For example, a calendar live tile might show your next appointment, and a Facebook live tile might show the latest photo you shared.\n\nIn all likelihood, the applications that appear on this panel will overlap with the automatically-generated list of most-used applications that appears on the left hand side of the Start menu, but there are arguably some instances when the two will differ.\n\nIf having live tiles in the Start menu seems a bit pointless, you can just delete them all and reduce the size of the Start menu so that it appears just as it would in Windows 7.\n\nWith Windows 8, if you launch an app from the Windows Store while you are in desktop mode, it automatically goes full-screen and switches to mobile mode. Many users have complained that this is confusing and irritating, and that it is not clear how to get back to desktop mode.\n\nWith Windows 10, clicking on one of the live tiles in the Start menu does not take you into the mobile interface. Rather, it launches the application within the desktop environment, in a window that can be resized, maximised, minimised and closed, just like any other Windows program.\n\nFrom the user's point of view, this is much more intuitive, and means you no longer have to think about whether the program you are running is a traditional program or a Windows Store application \u2013 they all run the same way.\n\nUnder the hood, Microsoft points out that improvements in Windows 10 mean apps start faster, run faster, are significantly more secure and help to extend battery life. However, from a consumer point of view, the most important thing is that they work the way you expect.\n\nFor 20 years, Microsoft has been offering the same web browser, called Internet Explorer. Over that time, numerous updates have been made and features added that primarily serve the needs of business customers \u2013 such as group policy settings and line-of-business app compatibility \u2013 that most consumers don\u2019t need and don't care about.\n\nWith Windows 10, Microsoft is introducing a new browser called Edge, which is aimed squarely at consumers. The focus is on speed and ease of use, stripping out things like ActiveX controls and essentially making the internet a less stressful place to be.\n\nEdge includes a number of nice features like a button that allows you to convert any web page into an easy-to-read format, removing adverts and sidebars and allowing you to focus on the core content such as text and pictures. Users can also customise the colour of the background and the size of the font to improve the reading experience.\n\nIf you bookmark a web page in Edge it will automatically cache the page so that you can read it offline. There is also a tool called Web Note that allows you circle things on the page, make notes and highlight passages of text. You can then take a screenshot and share the image via email or a social network.\n\nWindows 10 will also come with Internet Explorer pre-installed, for people who want access to a richer set of web tools. However, Edge will become the default browser on Windows 10, and Microsoft believes that it will provide more than enough functionality for the average web user.\n\nMicrosoft has long supported keyboard shortcuts to allow people to manage multiple apps running on their desktop, such as alt-tab to cycle between apps, and the Windows and arrow keys to split the screen, but they are not well known. In Windows 10, it is more obvious how to issue these commands.\n\nFor example, there is now a button on the taskbar that gives you a zoomed-out view of all the apps running, and lets you select the one you want. It is also possible to create multiple virtual desktops and choose which apps to run on which desktop.\n\nMicrosoft said this could be useful if you are working on several projects and want to create a virtual desktop with all the relevant apps for each project. Then if you wanted to share your desktop with a colleague over Skype, for example, you could just share the appropriate desktop. It also lets you keep your work apps and personal apps separate.\n\nApps can easily be dragged between different virtual desktops, and if you close one desktop, all the apps that are open will automatically transfer to a different desktop.\n\nIt is also possible to 'snap' apps to different parts of the screen simply by dragging them into the appropriate place. So if you drag a window to the top right corner, for instance, it will automatically adjust its size to fill exactly a quarter of the screen. Other windows can then be snapped to the other three corners to present a neat split-screen view.\n\nWhile none of these features are exactly Earth-shattering, they do help to make some of the less-well-known functions in Windows more easily accessible and consumer-friendly.\n\nCortana is one of the more innovative features of Windows 10. Already available on Windows Phone, Cortana is Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri and Google Now. While many people think of it purely in terms of issuing voice commands, it is actually much more than that.\n\nCortana uses artifical intelligence to learn about the user and provide personalised information. The digital personal assistant is integrated into the desktop, Microsoft applications and the Edge browser, and works across PCs, tablets and mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. You can interact with Cortana either by speaking, or by typing queries, and she will respond in the same way.\n\nOn the desktop, Cortana appears as a search field in the taskbar. This can be used to search across documents, folders, settings, apps, photos, videos and music stored on the computer or device, as well as on the web using Bing search.\n\nOver time, Cortana learns more about you, such as bands you like and sports teams you support, and proactively highlights relevant news and information from the web. With your permission, it can also use location technology to learn where you live and work, and identify other important places, to better tailor its responses\n\nThis means that, as well as typing or dictating standard search queries like \"How old is Harrison Ford?\" or \"How do I get to Buckingham Palace?\" which will provide responses from Bing search, you can also ask \"How long will it take me to get home?\" or issue a command like \"Remind me to put the bins out,\" and it will understand and respond appropriately.\n\nThanks to integration with Microsoft's email and calendar clients, Cortana can extract relevant information and issue prompts. For example, if you have been discussing a particular airline flight in an email, and that flight is delayed, Cortana will alert you about the delay. Or of you have a meeting across town and there is heavy traffic, it will tell you when you need to leave to avoid being late.\n\nThanks to integration with the Edge browser, users can also use Cortana to pull up extra information on places, people, restaurants or individual words without having to leave the web page they're on, by simply right-clicking on the words and selecting \"Ask Cortana\".\n\nAlthough digital personal assistants are becoming more commonplace, some people will find some of these features a bit creepy or invasive. Microsoft stresses that Cortana will only access the information you give it permission to access, so if you would rather she kept out of your email and calendar, you can block her from seeing that information.\n\nPeople have become fairly used to having notifications popping up on their smartphones and tablets, but Windows 10 also brings them to the desktop. If you are using a keyboard and mouse, an icon will appear on the taskbar to alert you to messages and events you haven't seen.\n\nClicking on the icon will bring up a notification centre with more information, as well as shortcuts to the relevant apps. Users can also turn WiFi on or off from within the notification centre, or adjust 'quiet hours' and battery saver. If you\u2019re using a touch interface, you can just swipe from the side to bring up the notification centre.\n\nWindows 10 includes a range a new security features, including support for biometrics. A new feature called Windows Hello allows you to unlock your desktop either by looking at the screen or using your fingerprint.\n\nThe facial recognition feature requires an infrared camera like Intel's RealSense. The camera scans your face in 3D and compares it with data stored on the computer to determine whether or not you are the validated user.\n\nMicrosoft said that Windows 10 does not store an image of your face on the computer, merely a data representation of that image, so if the data got into the wrong hands, it would not be possible to reconstruct the image.\n\nMicrosoft is killing off of Windows Media Center \u2013 its software for recording and playing TV, music and video \u2013 in Windows 10, and replacing it with modified versions of Xbox Music and Xbox Video, which have been renamed as 'Groove' and 'Movies & TV' respectively.\n\nGroove users can upload all their MP3s (including those purchased from iTunes) to Microsoft's cloud service, OneDrive, and access them using the Groove app on any Windows device, Xbox, or via a web browser. Microsoft said that the Groove app will also be available on Android phones and iPhones soon.\n\nOn the Windows 10 desktop, users can drag individual tracks into playlists, hover over the taskbar icon for playback controls, or right click to pin an album to the Start menu.\n\nThey can also sign up for a Groove Music Pass subscription (previously Xbox Music Pass) for \u00a38.99 per month, which allows them to stream and download music from the Windows Store and create custom radio stations based on their favourite songs, albums and artists \u2013 a bit like Spotify.\n\nMeanwhile, the Movies & TV app in Windows 10 lets users import their personal video collection, buy or rent films and TV shows from the Windows Store, and drag and drop videos between different collections.\n\nOne nice feature of the Movies & TV app is that users can start watching a video on one Windows 10 device, and then pick up where they left off on another device.\n\nUnlike with previous versions of the operating system, Windows 10 works across all Microsoft devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones \u2013 as well as the Xbox games console and HoloLens, Microsoft's new wireless holographic headset.\n\nThis means that any device can theoretically run Windows 10 in any mode, but practically it works by detecting the status of the device it is on and automatically choosing the most appropriate mode.\n\nFor example, when a Surface Pro 3 tablet is plugged into a keyboard it will be in desktop mode, but when the keyboard is unplugged a notification pops up asking the user if they want to switch to tablet mode. If the user agrees, the live tiles will become full screen, and it will feel more like Windows 8 \u2013 but with some improvements.\n\nFor example, there is now a button on the taskbar that lets you see all your frequently used apps, as well as date, time, network and power levels at a glance. Cortana is also integrated into the tablet and mobile mode, and draws data from all the same apps.\n\nUsers can choose to manually switch to desktop mode, even on small tablets and smartphones. However, if you open an app it will switch back to mobile mode and run full-screen, unless there is a keyboard attached. This is because Microsoft claims that most users prefer to use live tiles if they have a touchscreen.\n\nIf you hated Windows 8 in tablet mode, you'll probably hate Windows 10 in tablet mode as well. However, this is Microsoft's best attempt yet at making its core applications work on a touchscreen interface.\n\nMicrosoft will begin rolling out Windows 10 in 190 countries and 111 languages on 29 July. Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users can pre-register for their free Windows 10 upgrade by clicking the Windows logo that will have appeared on the right-hand side of their taskbar.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean they will get Windows 10 on 29 July. The update will first be rolled out to the 4.4 million people who have taken part in the Windows Insider programme.\n\nMicrosoft will then begin notifying people who have reserved their copy of Windows 10 in waves, slowly scaling up after 29 July. Once a copy becomes available, Microsoft will scan the user's computer to check it is compatible, and then download Windows 10 automatically.\n\nIf the user's system is not yet ready to be upgraded to Windows 10, Microsoft will provide more details during the upgrade experience. In some cases, users will need to contact an application provider or device manufacturer to learn more.\n\nThe update is free to anyone with a registered version of Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 who opts in within a year. After this time, Microsoft will charge a fee. Anyone using an older version of Windows, or buying a new computer with Windows 10 installed on it, will also have to pay.\n\nWindows 10 for desktop is a massive improvement over Windows 8. It builds on the more intuitive aspects of Windows 7 and Windows 8, combining the familiarity of the Start menu with a number of new features that genuinely seem to improve user experience, such as Edge and Cortana.\n\nMicrosoft appears to have learnt from the success of Google's Chromebooks that most consumers would choose a clean interface and the ability to access the web instantly over a complex system with lots of heavy-duty tools. These tools are still available if you dig down but, crucially, they don't get in the way.\n\nAlthough live tiles are still a feature of Windows 10, they are much less intrusive than in Windows 8. They can be as much or as little of a feature as the user wants, and can even be removed altogether. With this new level of control, users may feel more inclined to explore the utility of live tiles in a desktop environment without feeling like they're being forced upon them.\n\nWhen used on a tablet or smartphone, Windows 10 is not hugely different from Windows 8; most of the changes are under the hood. However, small improvements in usability should make learning the system less of a chore for the uninitiated.\n\nUltimately, Windows 10 seems like an operating system that both Windows 7 and Windows 8 users can upgrade to with confidence. For Windows 7 users, some elements will still feel alien, but unlike with Windows 8, there is enough that is familiar to make the transition relatively painless.\n\nWindows 8 users, meanwhile, will find a lot to like in Windows 10. Many of the rougher edges of Windows 8 have been smoothed over, making the whole experience feel slicker and more like what its predecessor should have been.\n\nSome may choose to wait and hear what friends and family have to say about Windows 10 before taking the plunge. However, with the ongoing investment in this version of the platform from both Microsoft and the millions of Insiders who will continue to provide feedback after launch, Windows 10 may prove to be not only the last but also the best version of Windows.",

At the time, CCMP said that his departure was \u201chealth-related,\u201d but declined to provide any additional comment.\n\nLast Thursday, Murray died in his own home at the age of 52.\n\nWhat follows is something I\u2019ve been struggling with, but which I\u2019ve obviously decided to report. Namely because there is as much professional as personal in this situation, and that\u2019s my job (some may disagree, and that\u2019s understandable).\n\nMultiple sources now say that CCMP was tipped off in mid-December that Murray might have a serious substance abuse problem. It was not something that any of his partners had previously suspected, but a subsequent investigation led the firm, in January, to place Murray on a 60-day medical leave of absence. In written correspondence with limited partners, CCMP used the same \u201chealth-related\u201d terminology that it would use in February after determining that the separation with Murray needed to be made permanent.\n\nIt appears that CCMP was more forthcoming in response to verbal queries from certain LPs \u2014 including members of its LP advisory committee \u2014 but never in writing (likely for legal reasons).\n\nFor CCMP, this situation is about more than personal tragedy and professional embarrassment. Murray\u2019s departure triggered a key-man provision on a $3.6 billion fund that closed just last September.\n\nCCMP actually had multiple key-man clauses on the fund: Sole provisions for both Murray and then-chairman (now CEO) Greg Brenneman, and also for a certain majority of its investment committee. A rolling reinstatement process is now underway. I would imagine that it will pass (i.e., the firm will get to keep investing) \u2014 particularly given that the fund is already around 40% committed, and LPs committed to the broader team within the past year \u2014 but not all the votes are in yet.\n\nCCMP declined to comment for this story.",

        "text": "The Kidz Bop Kids are a live-tour extension of the Kidz Bop album series, which updates the latest pop hits into kid-friendly versions.\n\n\u201cHi! My name is Cassie. I\u2019m 8 years old, and I\u2019m going to sing \u2018Anaconda\u2019 by Nicki Minaj.\u201d\n\nThat does not happen at a Kidz Bop Kids show, of course, but you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting such a jaw-dropping scenario. The Kidz Bop Kids are the public face and live-tour extension of Kidz Bop, the wildly successful album series on which youngsters sing today\u2019s top hits, often with family-friendly changes to the lyrics.\n\nThe company\u2019s tagline, \u201csung by kids for kids,\u201d is such a no-brainer. But it didn\u2019t take flight until Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam, cofounders of the label Razor & Tie, developed the idea in late 2000. The first volume of Kidz Bop, released the next year, was an immediate and massive success.\n\nSo much so that 14 years on, there are 28 volumes, most of which routinely crack the top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and kid album charts. That\u2019s in addition to various themed compilations such as country, Christmas, \u201csports jamz,\u201d and the Spanish-language Los Kidz Bop. Having sold more than 15 million albums, the franchise has become a juggernaut in children\u2019s music, a precursor to \u201cGlee\u201d and Disney shows such as \u201cHannah Montana\u201d and \u201cHigh School Musical.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in 2000 the owners of the company were going to a bunch of kids\u2019 birthday parties, and they found that the music was not where it needed to be,\u201d says Victor Zaraya, Razor & Tie\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer. \u201cThe analogy we used to use is that the range was from Britney [Spears] to Barney. There was nothing in between.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think kids like hearing other kids sing,\u201d Zaraya adds. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to discount that.\u201d\n\nThe company holds national casting calls and talent searches to find singers for the series. Grant Knoche, a 12-year-old from Texas, became a member of the traveling Kidz Bop Kids ensemble, which comes to the Wilbur Theatre on June 27, after a rigorous audition process that included a two-day boot camp full of singing, dancing, and interviews.\n\n\u201cWe have to listen to the original song before we record it, but they send us the lyrics,\u201d Knoche says from his home in Dallas, with his father, Sean, also on the line. \u201cWhen we\u2019re traveling and songs we\u2019ve done come on the radio, we\u2019re all singing along but then hear a different word. And we\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s not how it goes!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a comfort for parents to know they can listen to pop songs and keep up with what\u2019s cool, but they\u2019re kid-friendly versions. It\u2019s good clean fun,\u201d says his dad, who mentions he left his six-figure job to support his son\u2019s budding career. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the Mickey Mouse Club of our modern time.\u201d\n\nZaraya says the series has tremendous oversight of what is appropriate for its young listeners; the target demographic is ages 5-10. A team decides which songs are good contenders, and because Kidz Bop stays so current and usually releases at least two albums a year, sometimes it has to forecast what will become a hit.\n\nSpending an hour with the Kidz Bop catalog is an astonishing reminder of just how un-kid-friendly most of today\u2019s pop music is. Some songs, particularly ones dealing with explicit sexuality, are inherently not suitable. The aforementioned \u201cAnaconda\u201d comes to mind, and Zaraya says Robin Thicke\u2019s divisive \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d while a major hit, certainly never made the cut.\n\nEven the most innocuous lyric suddenly carries the weight of issues parents might not want to address with their children just yet. On the newest Kidz Bop, which debuted at No. 10 last month, their version of Taylor Swift\u2019s recent hit \u201cBlank Space\u201d swaps out a crucial line \u2013 \u201cGot a long list of ex-lovers/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m insane\u201d \u2013 with the more generic, \u201cGot a long list of some others/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m to blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\u201d from Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d gets a PG-13 makeover: \u201cWill your mouth still remember the look of my love?\u201d Whereas Bruno Mars exclaims on \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too hot/ Hot damn!\u201d the Kidz Bop Kids brag, \u201cI\u2019m too hot/ Hot yeah!\u201d\n\nThe series has its detractors. The iTunes reviews are especially damning \u2013 \u201cplease parents, do not ruin your child\u2019s ears by making them listen to this\u201d or \u201cHonestly, u should just buy the regular song\u201d \u2013 criticisms Kidz Bop has battled since day one.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who criticizes us, I\u2019d say it\u2019s for kids primarily. It\u2019s not for teenagers, who I think are the harshest critics,\u201d Zaraya counters. \u201cIf you put aside your thoughts on why it\u2019s not as cool as the original and just embrace having a good time with pop music, then I think there\u2019s a time and place for Kidz Bop. We\u2019re not just a trend.\u201d",

How often does your best friend become your brother?\" he tells PEOPLE. \"We have been through a lot together.\"\n\nIt's what they have been through that makes this ordinary day a special one.\n\nDavion made national headlines in 2013 when, at 15-years-old, he made a\n\nfor someone to adopt him.\n\n\"My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born,\" he told the congregation. \"I know God hasn't given up on me.

        "text": "When Time Warner announced in early March its plan to spin off the Time Inc. magazine unit by the end of 2013, financial analysts and the business press expressed broad agreement on the prospects for the two future entities. For the new Time Warner, the prevailing view was highly positive: The split is the next logical step in solidifying a pure-play television and motion picture colossus after the spinoffs of AOL and Time Warner Cable four years ago, and with CEO Jeff Bewkes shedding the drag of magazines and sharpening his focus on a stable of growing businesses, his record of enriching shareholders seems bound to keep rolling.\n\nFor a newly independent Time Inc., the 91-year-old publisher of Time, Sports Illustrated, People, and dozens of other titles, including Fortune, the general opinion was downbeat: Unlike Time Warner, which grew operating earnings in its nonpublishing businesses by 4.7% last year, the magazine business needs radical change. Put simply, revenues and profits for Time Inc. and the magazine industry as a whole are shrinking.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what strategy will reverse that decline. But industry experts and analysts agree that it might require daring bets \u2014 new digital platforms, alliances with tech-savvy partners, and even shrewd acquisitions. \u201cMagazines could have a strong digital model, better than most media companies,\u201d says Neil Begley, a fixed-income analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cBut for magazines to have a fighting chance, they will need financial flexibility, meaning the freedom to invest heavily to revive their businesses.\u201d\n\nTo get a dispassionate view of our parent company\u2019s prospects as a spinoff, we talked to Begley and other analysts, along with portfolio managers and investment bankers, for their views on how Time Warner should proceed. By and large, they endorsed Begley\u2019s view that Time Inc. would perform best with low leverage and the ability to be financially agile. It is certainly in the interest of Time Warner for the new Time Inc. to find favor with investors. The parent company\u2019s shareholders will receive stock in the new company \u2014 shares representing roughly 5%, or 1/20, of the value of a Time Warner share. Since Time Warner spun off AOL and Time Warner Cable in 2009, the stocks of those two companies have easily outperformed the broader market. And shares of Time Warner itself have nearly doubled.\n\nFor Time Inc., however, the path to revival could be blocked even before the spinoff happens. The crucial issue, analysts agree, is the amount of debt that Time Warner will place on Time Inc. If the magazine company is saddled with excessive leverage, it will lack what it needs to grow again: ample cash for big investments. It\u2019s tough to be innovative when your main concern is paying down debt. Diverting too much cash flow to debt payment could also stifle Time Inc.\u2019s ability to pay a dividend. Another factor is that Time Inc. must replace outgoing CEO Laura Lang. Attracting a star to the job will be a lot easier if the company isn\u2019t overleveraged.\n\nSo how much debt is the new Time Inc. likely to carry? The most common measure for leverage is the ratio of debt to Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization \u2014 essentially the cache of profits available for making interest payments. Time Inc.\u2019s Ebitda has been falling sharply since 2007. According to projections by Morgan Stanley, its Ebitda will reach $524 million by 2014, its first year as an independent company. That\u2019s a 15% drop from 2012.\n\nTime Warner hasn\u2019t given a specific number yet for what the debt load will be. Nor has it said whether it will pitch Time Inc. as a stock that pays a dividend at the outset. (Analysts believe that asking the fledgling company to pay a dividend and service debt could stunt its prospects.) On Wall Street predictions range widely, from $500 million to $2 billion. But an individual familiar with Time Warner\u2019s thinking told Fortune that the company \u201cplans to put on a level of leverage consistent with the ratios followed at Time Warner.\u201d Time Warner has a current debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 2.6, close to its stated goal of 2.5. Let\u2019s assume that Bewkes plans to base the spinoff company\u2019s ratio on Time Inc.\u2019s 2013 Ebitda of close to $600 million. In that scenario Time Inc.\u2019s debt would approach $1.5 billion.\n\nThe 2.5-times-Ebitda number may be right for Time Warner, but Begley and others think the ratio is excessive for Time Inc., which does not boast the same credit quality or diversified revenue sources as its parent. Consider that entertainment and publishing conglomerate News Corp. plans to shed its publishing assets this year \u2014 as the new News Corp. \u2014 with no debt.\n\nHere\u2019s how piling on excessive debt could choke off the new Time Inc.\u2019s investment capital. Afoccording to Begley, Time Inc. cannot afford to let its interest costs absorb a bigger and bigger share of its cash flow. To reassure investors, it should hold constant the cents in interest that it pays on each dollar of Ebitda. Ebitda has been shrinking at over 7% a year for five years, and most analysts expect the trend to continue. So Time Inc., from 2014 to 2018, would need to pay down an average of $95 million in principal on its $1.5 billion in borrowings to hold its interest payments constant at 19\u00a2, or 19% of Ebitda.\n\nThe crucial number is what\u2019s left over after Time Inc. pays its taxes and interest. That\u2019s the free cash that it can lavish on digital publishing technology or acquisitions. From 2014 to 2019 it would be forced to spend over a third of its cash flow on debt repayments, lowering the amount available for investments to around $180 million a year. But a bigger number would generate higher earnings and also make the company far safer in the eyes of lenders and shareholders.\n\nSo let\u2019s consider a second scenario: Time Warner structures the independent Time Inc. with a relatively light debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 1 to 1. That\u2019s the amount of leverage that Begley recommends. Based on its 2013 Ebitda, Time Inc. would then carry about $600 million in debt. To be prudent, it would still pay down principal each year to keep debt service at a constant portion of its Ebitda. But since both its interest and principal payments would be lower, Time Inc. would generate more cash each year.\n\nLayer on a second set of assumptions: Let\u2019s forecast that Time Inc. spins off with a 1-to-1 ratio and invests aggressively, and that those investments are successful. As a result, cash flows keep dropping in 2014 and 2015, then embark on modest growth of 3% a year through 2019. From then on, they simply rise with inflation at around 2%. In this projection, the cash flow available for investment would average about $320 million, almost 80% higher than under the $1.5 billion debt load scenario. The rising cash flows would create a virtuous cycle of ever lower debt and stable earnings.\n\nThat kind of turnaround will prove a tough challenge. But if Time Inc. can generate any kind of growth \u2014 and again, low leverage is key \u2014 its stock could actually be quite attractive to investors. Most analysts predict that after the spinoff Time Inc. will have an enterprise value \u2014 debt plus equity, minus cash \u2014 of around $4 billion. If that proves true and that the company takes on the more manageable $600 million debt load, Time Inc. will have an equity value of $3.8 billion. If Time Inc. can indeed restore growth by 2016, it could potentially boast a market cap of $6.3 billion by the end of 2019 \u2014 meaning annual returns of 9% for five years starting in 2014. That would be more than enough to turn a struggling magazine company into an unexpected Wall Street success story.\n\nThis story is from the April 08, 2013 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "A week ago, it seemed almost certain: The Federal Reserve would raise its key short-term interest rate next month after holding it near zero for close to seven years. Policy makers, over the past few months, had signaled as much as the US economy continued to grow steadily and the unemployment rate continued to fall.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s gyrations in global stock markets, largely tied to fears about China\u2019s slowing economy, the debate over whether the Fed should hike rates was renewed. Fed officials themselves seemed rattled and divided what to do.\n\nOn Monday, as stocks plunged around the world, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said he expected policy makers to stick to the tentative plan to raise rates in September. But a few days later, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, tried to reassure markets by saying the argument for raising rates had become \u201cless compelling.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee meet Sept. 16 and 17. Should they raise interest rates?\n\nThose who favor raising rates basically argue, \u201cEnough already.\u201d\n\nUnemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent and the US economy, according to the Commerce Department, grew at a healthy 3.7 percent pace in the second quarter. There\u2019s simply no need for the Fed to keep propping up the economy with such low rates.\n\n\u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t looking at reality,\u201d said Alex J. Pollock, a resident fellow specializing in financial affairs at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe rates should be raised.\u201d\n\nLike others who favor a Fed rate increase, Pollock said Fed policies \u2014 low interest rates and the earlier \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy by buying government and other securities \u2014 have created distortions in markets that have led to surging stock, bond, and real estate prices. Continuing easy money policies risks a new burst of inflation and creating the type of bubbles that led to the last recession.\n\n\u201cYou look around Boston and other cities, like New York and San Francisco, and you see the effects \u2014 all the commercial construction going on, being built with cheap money,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief executive and chief economist at Decision Economics Inc., a Boston consulting firm. \u201cUltimately, it leads to excesses and problems.\u201d\n\nSinai said he placed odds of a Fed rate hike at about 70 percent heading into last week. But he said it\u2019s \u201cnow a tossup\u201d what the Fed will do next month.\n\nBased on futures prices, investors see a 38 percent chance the Fed will move at the September meeting of the Open Market Committee and a 49 percent probability of a rate rise at the Oct. 27-28 meeting, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThose who oppose raising rates at this point say, yes, the US economy has improved, but it\u2019s still fragile and recent world events make it vulnerable to a possible slowdown \u2014 or worse. Wages are barely growing, they say, a sign that the labor market might not be as strong as the unemployment rate suggests.\n\nOpponents of a rate hike note that the Fed normally raises interest rates when it fears a sharp increase in inflation. But the inflation rate is now only running at about 0.3 percent a year, well below the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2 percent. Falling oil and commodity prices are easing price pressures further.\n\nInflation, they add, is so low that a shock that further weakens the economy could lead to deflation, the destructive cycle of falling prices and wages, and high unemployment. The Great Depression was an extreme example of deflation. More recently, Japan has struggled for the better part of the last two decades to break a cycle of deflation and anemic economic growth.\n\n\u201cInflation is simply not a threat right now,\u201d said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any pressing reasons why the Fed needs to raise rates now.\u201d\n\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Tufts University, said he worries that raising interest rates now might further strengthen the US dollar, making American-produced goods more expensive overseas and hurting export sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cThey should absolutely not raise rates,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "David Armstrong, who has died at age 60 from liver cancer, never achieved the kind of recognition afforded his best friend, Nan Goldin, but his influence was acknowledged of late by a younger generation of photographers, including Ryan McGinley. \u201cHe has a specific style and owns it,\u201d McGinley told the New York Times in 2011, when Armstrong\u2019s book, 615 Jefferson Avenue, was published. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Vermeer, using only sunlight to illuminate uni-directionally. His photographs are about desire and despair. These are qualities he looks for in the boys\u2019 eyes.\u201d\n\nThe boys in question were the male models that Armstrong had been photographing between 2001 and 2011, making the beautiful young men seem both timeless and out-of-time in his curiously classical and unapologetically romantic portraits. Armstrong had come to fashion photography relatively late, having been commissioned by the young designer Hedi Slimane to shoot backstage at a Dior catwalk show in 2001. Suddenly, in middle age, he was hip again and also ubiquitous, shooting editorials for the likes Vogue Homme and Purple magazine. It was an unexpected \u2013 and, one could say, unrepresentative \u2013 coda to a remarkable life lived, in the main, on the margins amid fellow freaks and outsiders.\n\nBorn in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1954, Armstrong befriended Nan Goldin when he was 14. He later said: \u201cAll the cool kids who met in the morning to eat hash brownies talked about this legend, Nan Goldin, who got kicked out of school the year before.\u201d He was the first person she photographed and they remained close throughout their teenage years and into their early twenties, both attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, where he studied painting before switching to photography. Alongside the likes of Jack Pierson, Philip-Lorca di Corcia and Mark Morrisroe, they became part of \u201cthe Boston School\u201d, unified by their shared approach to the making of arrestingly intimate images of their often dissolute everyday lives.\n\nIn Boston, and later in New York\u2019s Lower East Side, they both shot the same subjects \u2013 the drag queens and druggies that they hung out with. \u201cWe both delved in different ways with things available to us and didn\u2019t consider going outside our worlds,\u201d he told the New York Times.\n\nLike Goldin, Armstrong also became enmeshed in the hard drug culture he portrayed. His first boyfriend died of Aids in 1983 and, the following year, he went home to Boston to come off heroin. He stayed clean for 17 years, but began using again in 2002 describing himself wryly as \u201cfunctioning enough\u201d.\n\nIn 1994, Armstrong collaborated with Goldin on a photobook called A Double Life, which showed in their dramatically contrasting styles just how much their lives had intertwined. Armstrong\u2019s formally austere style and monochrome tones make his images seem, if anything more haunting than Goldin\u2019s. \u201cI used to think Nan and I were complete opposites and it was all about the complement,\u201d he noted at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from that. At the same time we\u2019re identical - like our pictures. At first they seem to come from different planets but finally they arrive at the same place.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Morel Books published Night and Day, a selection of Kodachromes from Armstrong\u2019s extensive New York archive from the late 1970s and early 1980s. A tale of drug-taking, partying and comedowns from an already long-lost time, it includes portraits of artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Di Corcia alongside shots of beautiful young people at play in the early hours.\n\n\u201cHe was such a cool cat \u2013 cultured in that old-school way,\u201d says Aron Morel, who got to know him over the past few years. \u201cHe reminded me a bit of Boris Mikhailov: two guys that worked because they loved it. Artists without the art market. The first time I met him, he sent me back to London with over 300 \u2018chromes\u2019 of the Night and Day series. Just like that \u2013 with complete trust. He was such a poetic guy. He had recently moved to a house in upstate New York and he said he was going to live his last days like Mrs Haversham in her mansion.\u201d Sadly, that was not to be.",

        "text": "For those of you just joining us at home, the other day shares of a company with the ticker symbol NEST soared 1,900 percent after Google announced the acquisition of Nest Labs. This was incredibly stupid because Nest Labs has nothing at all to do with NEST. It seems like a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSo the question Levine raised is whether trading in shares of NEST would be insider trading if you had advanced knowledge of the Google deal? Does the law prohibit you from using non-public information about a deal to profit off of people stupidly buying a different stock altogether?\n\nIn my earlier piece, I argued that insider trading law does say you can't do this. If you got the information because you were, say, a guy making deal toys for the people involved, you aren't allowed to take the information that you were entrusted with and that belongs to others, in this case Google and Nest, and use it to trade for yourself. And if you got the information from your buddy who was involved in the deal somehow, then you inherit his breach of fiduciary duty and so you're in trouble.\n\nNot so fast, says Levine. To give rise to insider trading liability, information must not only be non-public. It must also be \"material.\" And, to make a long Levine post short, since Nest Labs has no relationship to NEST, information about Nest Labs cannot be material to NEST.\n\nThat seems rather straight forward and smart. But it's wrong.\n\nHere's how the judge instructed the jury in the recent case against Mark Cuban:\n\n\"Materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information. Materiality is not judged in the abstract, but in light of the surrounding circumstances. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the information would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder.\"\n\nSo here's something both the federal courts and the SEC consider to be an important factor when considering materiality: The effect on the stock's price. As the Third Circuit put it in Oran v. Stafford, \"when a stock is traded in an efficient market, the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement, in the period immediately following disclosure, of the price of the firm's stock.\"\n\nThe price of NEST shares rose 1,900 percent when the deal was disclosed. That pretty much screams materiality.\n\nLevine says that the information isn't material because the connection just isn't \"reasonable.\" Or, rather, that no reasonable investor in NEST would care about the acquisition of Nest Labs. Sure the stock price moved, but that was unreasonable. And stupid. So it's not material.\n\nThe problem with this line of argument is that in Levine's scenario, the investor with inside information buys shares of NEST as part of a scheme to trade from a mistake he anticipates occurring when the deal is announced. And then that mistake happened. That may be stupid but it's not unreasonable\n\nLet's put it this way. Would knowledge of the Google deal have played a part in the decision of owners of NEST to sell their shares the day before the deal was announced? It may not have been decisive but surely it would have played some part. I mean, you own shares of worthless stock that could have value tomorrow based on investor error. Why not hold it an extra day?\n\nMore importantly, I think Levine is wrong about the touch point of materiality. He assume that the information needs to be material about the company in which the shares actually were traded. That's incorrect, in my opinion. Keep in mind that in a misappropriation case, the duty breached that gives rise to illegality is not owed to the person on the other side of the trade. It's owed to the person who is the source of the information. The line of materiality should also connect not to the investors in NEST but back to the investors in the source of the information, Google. And for Google investors, the multi-billion acquisition almost certainly was material.\n\nMisappropriation is about using the information that belongs to others for your own benefit, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality toward them. When judging materiality, it only makes sense that the correct place to look is to the owners of the information.",

And they are quietly raised again in the celebratory exhibition and catalog \u201cA Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant-Garde, 1960s-1980s\u201d at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University, as well as in Joan Rothfuss \u2019s entertaining new biography, \u201cTopless Cellist: The Improbable Life of Charlotte Moorman.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Rothfuss\u2019s research, Moorman could have enjoyed a normal middle-class American life. Growing up in Little Rock, Ark., an only child who studied music and won the \u201cMiss City Beautiful\u201d contest at age 19, she was not a born rebel. Even after her move in 1957 to New York, where she attended the Juilliard School for a year and married a double-bassist, she envisioned herself playing cello in an orchestra or string ensemble.\n\nBut performing the classics, Moorman decided, was a bore compared to the offerings in New York\u2019s experimental music and art scene during the \u201960s. Her marriage annulled, she took up with a series of male mentors. (She ended up happily paired with the visual artist Frank Pileggi. )\n\nAn eccentric who never threw anything away, Moorman has left the show\u2019s six curators\u2014one of whom is Ms. Rothfuss\u2014with almost too much material to sift in presenting her flamboyant life. (Northwestern bought the artist\u2019s archive and has been organizing it since 2001.)\n\nIn addition to photographs of her in many productions, the exhibition has museum loans of Paik\u2019s video sculptures and a program of films and videos that shows her playing works by Paik (\u201cSonata for Adults Only\u201d) and others. There are cellos that Moorman fashioned, in neon or from syringes (used for her cancer treatments), as well as the felt-covered instrument that Joseph Beuys made for her to use in one of his works.\n\nAnnotated scores of music she performed by New York\u2019s avant-garde ( John Cage, Ornette Coleman, Paik) are here, along with her copy of Karlheinz Stockhausen \u2019s \u201cOriginale (Originals),\u201d a piece from 1964 in which she played the part of the \u201cString Player,\u201d wearing only gauze. Moorman was a key figure in helping these composers to introduce unpredictability, spectacle, danger and humor into the rarefied air of the classical music concert.\n\nOne way to liberate the audience, Paik believed, was to add nudity. In 1967 Moorman performed half-naked in his \u201cOpera Sextronique\u201d at a theater near Times Square. Arrested for indecent exposure, she spent the night in jail. The tabloid reporting on her trial, which resulted in a suspended sentence, defined her ever after in the public\u2019s mind as the \u201cTopless Cellist,\u201d a label she resented when she wasn\u2019t capitalizing on it.\n\nMoorman\u2019s packrat habits have proved invaluable in reconstructing a less well-documented phase of her career: her role as an impresario.\n\nIn 1963 she founded an annual Festival of the Avant Garde in New York. With almost no resources except her own vivaciousness, she produced it for 15 years, moving it around the city into nontraditional arenas for art and music\u2014Grand Central Terminal, Shea Stadium, Floyd Bennett Field, and the World Trade Center.\n\nThe walls and cases in the exhibition\u2019s second half are papered with her ads and programs for the festivals, supplemented by the photographs of Peter Moore, one of the few who attended all of these ephemeral events. Dozens of composers (Var\u00e8se, Cage, Morton Feldman, Luciano Berio ), filmmakers ( Bruce Conner, Jack Smith ), performance artists and dancers ( Allan Kaprow, Yoko Ono, Dick Higgins, Lucinda Childs ) participated because Moorman cajoled them.\n\nShe had \u201ca flair for getting EVERYBODY involved, including the more sophisticated who think Charlotte is silly; and she always somehow pulled it off,\u201d wrote the critic Jill Johnston in the Village Voice after one of these festivals.\n\nSome feminist artists in the \u201960s and \u201970s were wary of Moorman. Carolee Schneemann thought her a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d and the roster of her festivals was overwhelmingly male.\n\nThe public was more flummoxed. In a clip here from the Merv Griffin TV show, the studio audience laughs nervously as she holds a string down the back of Jerry Lewis and uses him to perform Paik\u2019s \u201cHuman Cello.\u201d\n\nA comedian in her own right, whose friendly smile and Southern accent could disarm most hostile crowds, Moorman knew that just because you weren\u2019t afraid to look ridiculous didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t serious.\n\nMr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.",

Although the rain has tapered off in some areas, floodwaters are still climbing up over scores of river banks. Traffic in the French capital was snarled as flooding choked roads, and several Paris railway stations were shut.\n\nWhile the Louvre's most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" was safe on an upper floor, officials said about 250,000 artworks were located in flood-risk areas, mostly in basement storerooms. The art was hastily being moved upstairs -- a move officials described as precautionary.\n\nThe Orsay museum, on the left bank of the Seine, was also closed Friday to prepare for possible flooding.\n\nA spokeswoman at the Louvre said museum had not taken such precautions in its modern history - since its 1993 renovation at the very least. She spoke on condition of anonymity in line with the museum's policy.\n\nAt the Louvre, disappointed tourists were being turned away.\n\n\"I am really sorry, but we're closed today,\" one staffer told visitors. \"We have to evacuate masterpieces from the basement.\"\n\nElsewhere in Europe, authorities were counting the cost of the floods as they waded through muddy streets and waterlogged homes.\n\nGerman authorities said the body of a 65-year-old man was found overnight in the town of Simbach am Inn, bringing the country's death toll to 10. France's Interior Ministry also reported the death of a 74-year-old man who fell from his horse and drowned in a river in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris, the second death in France.\n\nIn eastern Romania, two people died and 200 people were evacuated from their homes as floods swept the area, including one man who was ripped from his bicycle by a torrent of water in the eastern village of Ruginesti.\n\nSeveral other people in Europe were missing Friday, including a Belgian beekeeper who was swept away by the current while trying to save his hives from rising waters in the eastern village of Harsin.\n\nThe foul weather has compounded the travel disruptions in France, which is already dealing with the fallout from weeks of strikes and other industrial actions by workers upset over the government's proposed labor reforms. French rail company SNCF said the strikes had led to the cancellation of some 40 percent of the country's high-speed trains.\n\nIn addition, French energy company Enedis says that more than 20,000 customers are without power to the east and south of Paris.\n\nOutside the Louvre, tourists expressed understanding over the museum's closure.\n\n\"It's good that they are evacuating the paintings. It's a shame that we couldn't see them today, but it's right that they do these things,\" said Carlos Santiago, who was visiting from Mexico.",

Back in January, Sanders tweeted a thank you card from 1993 from the then-first lady. He potentially tweeted this as a jab at Clinton for attacking his single-payer health care plan.\n\nNot every tweet is contentious, though. The two also occasionally use Twitter to support each other.\n\nClinton notably retweeted Sanders when he said \"America's first black president cannot and will not be succeeded by a hatemonger who refuses to condemn the KKK.\"\n\nAnd Sanders retweeted Clinton when she sent out a link to donate to Flint.\n\nMore from AOL.com: Marco Rubio wins Washington DC caucus, NBC News projects 'Ruin the rest of their lives': Donald Trump calls for arrests after wave of protests at rally Carson says Trump 'didn't really believe' his own rhetoric",

        "text": "Choosing which 1040 tax form you need to file your return on can be a lot harder to figure out than you'd think, but answering just a few basic questions will lead you to the right version.\n\nFirst of all, if you use tax software to prepare your return, then it will generally take the decision of which tax form to file out of your hands. Instead, the software will evaluate the answers you provide to its list of questions and then select the most appropriate form for your needs.\n\nFor those who prepare their own returns, though, the basic Internal Revenue Service rule is that the best form to file is the simplest one that addresses all of your needs. The 1040EZ is the easiest form to fill out, with the 1040A being more complicated but still less difficult than the full 1040 form.\n\nForm 1040EZ is designed for the simplest returns. In order to use it, you have to meet several requirements.\n\nFirst of all, Form 1040EZ is only available for filing status of single or married filing jointly, and those who have dependents to claim can't use the form. Taxpayers have to be under age 65 and ineligible for higher standard deductions for the blind.\n\nIn addition, there are income-related restrictions. You can't have more than $100,000 in taxable income, and in general, it can only come from wages, salaries, tips, unemployment compensation and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Some taxable interest is allowed, but only if it's less than $1,500 for the year. Alaska residents are also allowed to use 1040EZ even if they receive Permanent Fund dividends from the state.\n\nFinally, the only credit you can claim on the 1040EZ is the Earned Income Credit, and you can't itemize deductions or make any other adjustments to income. Those who received advance payments of premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act aren't eligible to file Form 1040EZ. Those who hire household employees like babysitters or nannies for whom they have to pay employment taxes also can't file 1040EZ, as well as those who are debtors in bankruptcy filings after Oct. 16, 2005.\n\nForm 1040A has some of the same restrictions as 1040EZ. Income has to be less than $100,000, and you still can't itemize deductions. But it's more flexible in other areas. For instance, heads of household, qualifying widows and widowers, and married people filing separately can use Form 1040A.\n\nForm 1040A allows you to include more types of income. In addition to those allowed on 1040EZ, you can have ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions from mutual funds, pension and annuity income, IRA distributions, and taxable Social Security benefits and still file a 1040A. You can also claim deductions for IRA contributions, student loan interest, tuition and fee payments, and expenses that educators pay for supplies for their own classrooms.\n\nYou can also claim more credits on a 1040A. Those seeking credits for child and dependent care expenses, education expenses, and retirement savings contributions can use the form, as can those claiming credits for the elderly or disabled. Both the child tax credit and the additional child tax credit are available to 1040A filers.\n\nLastly, you can handle a limited number of special situations on 1040A. Those receiving dependent care benefits from work can use the form, as can those who have to pay taxes due to having past educational credits recaptured. Even some people who owe alternative minimum taxes can use Form 1040A.\n\nIf you don't qualify for 1040EZ or 1040A treatment, then your only choice is the long Form 1040. Most notably, that includes taxpayers who want to itemize deductions.\n\nFor those who want it, the IRS has developed a tool to help you figure out which form is the simplest available for your needs. You can access it at\n\n, and it will take information from the tax forms you've received from your employer, financial institutions, and other sources to make a recommendation.\n\nFiling your taxes can seem complicated. But by starting with the right form, you'll be able to keep things as simple as possible and avoid biting off more than you need to chew at tax time.",
        "generated": "The IRS offers three different 1040 tax forms, 1040EZ, 1040A, and 1040, and choosing the right one depends on your filing status, income, and the credits and deductions you claim, with the 1040EZ being the simplest and most restrictive, and the 1040A and 1040 offering more flexibility but also more complexity.",
        "summary": "Make sure you choose the federal tax form that best reflects your income, credits, deductions and breaks: 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ."

        "text": "Taking Cuba off the list of nations that sponsor terrorism is the latest development that will attract foreign companies to the island. So who wants in? These five stats explain which industries present the most opportunities as Cuba opens for business.\n\nOne of the immediate benefits of renewed relations with Cuba is the increase in permitted remittance flows. The most recent figures put annual cash remittances to Cuba at approximately $5.1 billion, a level greater than the four fastest growing sectors of the Cuban economy combined. Now, permitted remittance levels from the U.S. will be raised fourfold, from $2,000 to $8,000 per year. This will help drive an increase in spending power in Cuba, which is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 4.6% through this decade. For global companies seeking a foothold anywhere they can, more money in the pockets of Cubans means more fuel for expansion. Take Coca-Cola. With an open Cuba, Coke could be legally be sold in every country in the world save one: North Korea.\n\n(Fortune, The White House, Euromonitor, Wall Street Journal)\n\n2. A lot more visitors\n\nJust 110 miles off the coast of Florida, Cuba should be a natural magnet for American travelers. Despite needing to meet special criteria to receive a visa from the State Department\u2014allowable categories include educational and journalistic activities\u2014170,000 Americans visited the country last year. As the restrictions slacken, the sky is literally the limit. JetBlue already charters flights to Cuba from the U.S., but the budget airline wants to start running regular commercial flights. American Airlines Group now flies to Cuba 20 times per week, a 33% increase in flights compared to just a year ago. More flights\u2014and more competition\u2014will make airfare more affordable, driving additional tourist traffic.\n\n(Travel Pulse, CNN Money, Wall Street Journal)\n\nOnly one in ten Cubans regularly use mobile phones and only one in twenty have uncensored access to the Internet. Even state-restricted Internet penetration currently stands at just 23.2%. The telecom infrastructure is so underdeveloped that an hour of regulated Internet connectivity can cost up to 20% of the average Cuban\u2019s monthly salary. There\u2019s serious demand for the major infrastructure investments needed to improve these numbers. Some start-ups are making waves in spite of shoddy internet. Airbnb, a website that lets people rent out lodging, announced that it has started booking rooms in Cuba with over 1,000 hosts. It gets around the lack of Internet by teaming with middlemen who have long worked to link tourists with bed and breakfasts.\n\n(Wharton, Freedom House, Fast Company)\n\n4. A cure for Cuba\n\nCuba has the third highest number of physicians per capita, behind only Monaco and Qatar. They\u2019re even used as an export: Venezuela pays $5.5 billion a year for the almost 40,000 Cuban medical professionals who now make up half of its health-care personnel. Cuban doctors lack access to most American pharmaceutical products and, importantly, to third-generation antibiotics. For its part, Cuba\u2019s surprisingly robust biotech industry makes a number of vaccines not currently available in the U.S. With the normalization of relations, Cuba can look to fully capitalize on its medical strengths.\n\n(Bloomberg, World Health Organization, Modern Healthcare, Brookings)\n\nCuba currently attracts around $500 million in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014good for just 1% of GDP. Given its tumultuous political history and underdeveloped economy, it is difficult to accurately predict how quickly investors will flock once the embargo has been lifted. But a good comparison might be the Dominican Republic, another Caribbean nation with roughly the same size population as Cuba. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that Cuba could potentially attract as much foreign capital as the Dominican Republic, which currently receives $17 billion in FDI ($2 billion from the U.S). But this won\u2019t happen overnight\u2014in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom, Cuba ranks 177th out of 178, ahead only of North Korea.\n\n(Wharton, ASCE, Peterson Institute, Heritage Foundation)",

        "text": "Corinne Grousbeck remembers the first time people treated her son Campbell as someone to be feared.\n\nCampbell, now 23, was about 18 months old. He\u2019d been born with serious visual impairment, and he wore glasses on the chance that his vision might improve, although it never did. \u201cBig goofy glasses,\u201d Grousbeck recalls.\n\nOne day, Grousbeck took him to the market. She had Campbell in a shopping cart when a little girl approached. The girl was curious about his eyewear, and started to engage with the tot.\n\n\u201cHe was not talking yet, but he got all animated,\u201d Grousbeck says. \u201cThen her mother came and scooped the little girl up. She said \u2018Honey, leave that little boy alone. There\u2019s something wrong with him.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow Grousbeck is out to wake up the public about society\u2019s misperceptions about the blind. Grousbeck, who chairs the board of trustees of Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, has spearheaded BlindNewWorld, a social change campaign aimed at breaking down the social and emotional barriers between the blind and the sighted. Grousbeck rattles off the list: \u201cFear, stigma, discomfort, pity.\u201d\n\nBlindNewWorld includes a social media effort and an inviting website that features stories, tips, and a quiz to educate sighted people about stereotypes and how to behave around the blind. Grousbeck also oversaw the production of two engaging public service announcements by Hollywood film and commercial director Tom DeCerchio.\n\nIn one of them, a single woman spots an attractive man across the room. When her friend tells her the man is blind, she has a moment\u2019s pause. Then she says, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I just came from yoga, and I\u2019m not wearing any makeup.\u201d In the other, an Uber driver discovers his blind passenger is a corporate vice president, and he learns just how capable the blind can be.\n\n\u201cIn the time since Campbell was little, the Internet has exploded, and with that came adaptive technology, and that has really balanced the skill set,\u201d says Grousbeck who was recently divorced from Wycliffe \u201cWyc\u201d Grousbeck, co-owner of the Celtics. She and Campbell are sitting in the living room of the Chestnut Hill home they moved into at the beginning of the year. It\u2019s still in transition \u2014 painting just finished, carpet still rolled up. Campbell navigates with his cane.\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy year for the Grousbecks. Corinne launched BlindNewWorld as she handled her duties at Perkins and as an overseer at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. She also serves on the leadership council for the chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, and is on the boards of several other organizations.\n\nThis month, her daughter Kelsey, Campbell\u2019s older sister, earned her MBA from Boston University, and Campbell graduated from Lesley University\u2019s two-year Threshold Program for young adults with special needs. He works as an assistant teacher at a preschool.\n\n\u201cI read them books, play my ukulele, and sing with them,\u201d Campbell says.\n\n\u201cIn the time since Campbell was little,\u201d says Corinne Grousbeck (above with her son on the Perkins School campus), \u201cthe Internet has exploded, and with that came adaptive technology, and that has really balanced the skill set.\u201d\n\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act mandates a job coach, who alerts Campbell if children run astray, but Campbell does the teaching.\n\nCampbell, an upbeat young man, has his own ways of smoothing the social waters. \u201cWhen a waitress has a nice voice, I ask her name,\u201d he says \u201cShe may say, \u2018Jane.\u2019 I\u2019ll say, oh, I know that name, it\u2019s a nice name.\u201d A connection is made.\n\nThe BlindNewWorld campaign is sponsored by Perkins, where Campbell is an alumnus. It follows on the heels of a Perkins study about how sighted people view the blind. Large percentages of those surveyed are wary of them.\n\n\u201cThe unemployment rate for the blind is two times the national average for the sighted,\u201d says Dave Power, Perkins\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cCorinne put her finger on a broader issue. Even if hired, there\u2019s a whole issue of comfort level with the blind. All the stats in this study bear out that barriers to success have to do with other people\u2019s perceptions.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Perkins started the Perkins-Business Partnership, bringing local businesses together to brainstorm about hiring. There, Grousbeck found forward-thinking companies such as State Street Bank, which she says values the benefits of hiring people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cIf you have a blizzard, half the employees don\u2019t show up,\u201d Grousbeck says. \u201cThe blind do. They work hard. They take public transportation. They take pride in their work. They\u2019re tenacious.\u201d\n\nThe BlindNewWorld website spotlights several successful visually impaired people, such as Karen Nagle and her husband, Chris. They live in Salem with their sons Eli and Henry, both younger than 3. Karen and Chris are legally blind. Chris is a software engineer, and Karen is a teacher who works with blind students in Salem public schools.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are afraid of blindness in general. Society is so visual,\u201d Karen said in an interview. \u201cPeople can\u2019t comprehend how the heck blind people do stuff, and they hold on to the stereotype of helplessness.\u201d\n\nKaren gets around with a seeing-eye dog. Once, as she was headed down the stairs at an MBTA Red Line station, \u201ca woman comes behind me and pulls my backpack to tell me there\u2019s an elevator,\u201d she says. \u201cShe got an earful from me. I could have fallen, and so could she.\u201d\n\nThen there was the time standing in line with her kids at the local market. \u201cThe guy in front of me tosses dollars at me,\u201d Karen says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say hi to me, he didn\u2019t talk to me. I gave it to the cashier to keep in case anyone was short a dollar or two.\u201d\n\nWhen Grousbeck first invited a copywriter to develop scripts for the PSAs, \u201cThe words came from pity,\u201d she says. Then she tapped DeCerchio, who asked her to fly to Los Angeles so he could read his scripts to her face-to-face. What she saw was the antidote to pity.\n\n\u201cI got goosebumps,\u201d she says. \u201c It\u2019s the dignity.\u201d\n\nRoughly 7 million Americans are blind. A recent Perkins School for the Blind study surveyed 1,000 people of all ages around the country. Among the findings:\n\n\u25a0 80 percent feel sorry for the blind.\n\n\u25a0 53 percent say they are uncomfortable around blind people.\n\n\u25a0 82 percent think the blind can\u2019t play sports.\n\n\u25a0 81 percent think the blind can\u2019t babysit.\n\n\u25a0 70 percent believe people who can\u2019t see can\u2019t shop for clothes.\n\n\u25a0 46 percent say they cannot think of a worse condition than blindness \u2014 including terminal illness and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u25a0 Only 28 percent think a person who is blind could do the respondent\u2019s job.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to make the world more hospitable to those who can\u2019t see. Here are some of BlindNewWorld\u2019s tips on how to be more inclusive:\n\n\u25a0 Introduce yourself in a normal tone of voice. (No need to speak louder than usual.)\n\n\u25a0 Discourage young children and others from staring or making disparaging comments.\n\n\u25a0 Offer to help blind people across construction zones and dangerous intersections.\n\n\u25a0 In a social situation, offer assistance: describe the layout of the room and who is there.\n\n\u25a0 Begin work meetings by asking people to identify themselves. Provide materials electronically instead of or in addition to hard copies.\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t fret about using vision-oriented phrases such as \u201cdid you see that?\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t pet the guide dog.",

        "text": "For a presidential candidate who has only won a single primary so far and has the fewest delegates of any of the three surviving candidates in the Republican presidential nomination contest, John Kasich has certainly been receiving his share of the attention. The Republican Party establishment, or at least elements of the establishment, has imprinted him as the \u201clast, best hope\u201d for mainstream Republicans to stop the Donald Trump train. But in light of Trump\u2019s crushing victory in New York last night, winning more than 60% of the vote, the prospects of a contested convention in which Kasich might emerge as the nominee has grown notably more dim.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s disastrous performance (he won just 14.5% of the vote) does little to help the cause of those Republicans who see in Cruz an instrument of Trump\u2019s downfall. And, while Kasich got 25% of the vote, this is hardly solace to those who have been vying for Kasich to emerge as the savior of the Republican Party.\n\nIndeed, in virtually any other presidential election cycle, a candidate who had piled up the kind of victories Trump has managed to achieve would be considered the presumptive nominee, and any remaining opposition would be under extraordinary pressure from the party establishment to throw in the towel and support the frontrunner. Of course, the phrase \u201cnormal political year\u201d doesn\u2019t quite describe 2016, and Trump is hardly the garden-variety frontrunner. There was a brief flurry of speculation about House Speaker Paul Ryan, who seemed to be on the verge of jumping into the race before he pulled the plug on a late entry into the nomination sweepstakes. But even Republicans still unable to even contemplate the prospect of a Trump nomination have surely come to the conclusion that trying to manipulate the process in a way that hands someone the nomination who hasn\u2019t even competed in the primaries would be a complete nonstarter, and even if such an effort got off the ground, would run the very real risk of blowing up the party.\n\nFor Cruz, the interest in Kasich is probably a sure sign that the Republican establishment will do everything within its power to prevent him, a candidate held in perhaps only marginally more regard than Trump (due to his perceived grandstanding in the Senate and refusal to \u201cplay ball\u201d with the GOP leadership), from getting the nomination. Were Cruz to prove the eventual agent of Trump\u2019s downfall, that would likely not endear him to most establishmentarians, for whom, as has been frequently noted, his usefulness to the \u201cStop Trump\u201d movement would come to an abrupt end. Cruz has been a placeholder, serving a useful purpose, but with no thaw in the party establishment\u2019s view of him.\n\nEven if he did win New York, the Kasich option seems farfetched. Where would he get 1,237 delegates, the minimum necessary, to win? Would a sufficient number of Trump or Cruz delegates peel off on a second, third, or even fourth ballot to give Kasich the nod? What seems far more likely is that at some point, if it seems clear that the establishment types have a realistic chance of pulling off a coup and installing Kasich as the nominee, delegates representing the Trump and Cruz factions would seek to take matters into their own hands, and, in some kind of \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d agree, holding their collective noses as they did so, to support one or the other of the candidates in return for significant concessions, either in terms of the vice presidency (if not Cruz himself than someone else acceptable to Cruz delegates), or in return for a significant voice in shaping the party platform and rules.\n\nAfter all, Cruz is a young man\u2014only 45 years old\u2014and he may well be beginning to think about his options in a world in which he is not the 2016 nominee. To do something that risks crippling the Republican Party for years to come would surely not be in his interests. Even the vice presidency is not completely out of the question as part of a grand bargain. While it is obvious there is no love lost between Trump and Cruz (an understatement if ever there was one), Cruz in the second position on the ticket is not completely implausible. Politics does indeed make for strange bedfellows, as John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would attest in the Democratic nomination battle of 1960. LBJ was loathed by the Kennedys and their supporters, who saw LBJ as a lightweight, cornpone Texas hack (completely dismissing LBJ\u2019s incredible legislative skills), and who wanted a liberal like Hubert Humphrey or Stuart Symington as his running mate. While Johnson\u2019s selection made complete sense from the standpoint of the general election, a Trump-Cruz ticket would likely not offer the kind of boost that Trump might be looking for.\n\nOf course, all of the above may very well be a theoretical exercise. Over the past week or so, Trump has appeared to strike a responsive chord with his recent comments, including an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, that the nominating system is rigged against him. But what may especially resonate was his ability to link what he perceives as the unfairness of the nominating system with the general sense felt by many Americans that the Washington establishment is rigged against them. Whatever Trump\u2019s limitations and weaknesses as a candidate, he and his campaign seem to have an uncanny ability to identify messages that resonate with voters, and the \u201crigged\u201d nomination process message might be the one that puts him over the top in Cleveland with a first ballot victory.\n\nThe next few weeks will not be kind to either Cruz or Kasich. Trump is almost certain to sweep the primaries in the northeast and Middle Atlantic states on Tuesday, including the big prize of Pennsylvania (Cruz may be able to win Indiana and West Virginia a few weeks later), and is now positioned to have enough delegates following California on June 7 that he will be within striking distance of the nomination. At that point, the dreams of the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement will turn into a nightmare. Either Trump will then use the period between June 7 and the start of the Republican Convention on July 18 to pick off the handful of remaining delegates needed, or, in a reprise of Gerald Ford\u2019s successful nomination in 1976, obtain the remaining delegates during the convention itself. The Trump card, of course, is the vice presidential spot on the ticket. Given Trump\u2019s problems with female voters (including governors Susanna Martinez of New Mexico and Nikki Haley of South Carolina), the obvious pick is none other than Kasich, governor of a critical battleground state and a candidate with extensive Washington experience, which Trump has claimed to seek. And, it is worth pointing out that Trump and Kasich have made nice with each other from the beginning. This may be no accident, as the Marxists say. So, Kasich may well have his day in the sun, just not quite in the role envisioned by the beleaguered party bigwigs.\n\nDr. Euel Elliott is a professor of public policy and political economy and the associate dean in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Grenada had been troubling the Reagan administration ever since its Constitution was suspended after a coup in 1979, and the new government began to cozy up to Communist Cuba.\n\nThe American invasion of Grenada was very unpopular in Britain, as Grenada was a Commonwealth nation.\n\n\u201cIf I were there Margaret, I\u2019d throw my hat in the door before I came in,\u201d Reagan said, which the BBC recalled was an old tradition that allowed an unwelcome guest to announce their arrival before they entered a room. The full transcript of the phone conversation is available on the Margaret Thatcher Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nWhile Thatcher wasn\u2019t exactly forgiving, she did say she understood where Reagan was coming from. \u201cI know about sensitivity, because of the Falklands. That\u2019s why I would not speak for very long even on the secret telephone to you. Because even that can be broken. I\u2019m very much aware of sensitivities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe action is underway now and we just hope it will be successful.\u201d\n\nThe conversation ended on good terms, though, with Thatcher getting off the phone to go to a \u201ctricky\u201d Parliament debate, and Reagan encouraging her to \u201cGo get \u2019em. Eat \u2019em alive.\u201d\n\nThe tapes, released to the public in October at the Reagan Library in Los Angeles, prove that Reagan continued the long Presidential tradition of recording phone conversations in the White House situation room, even after the debacle with former President Richard Nixon years earlier. It\u2019s also a classic example of an age-old trick: ask forgiveness, not permission.",

        "text": "About three years ago, Adobe research scientist Hailin Jin saw a need for a new technology that would make it easy for graphic designers to identify, compare, and choose typefaces. So he created the prototype of a product he dubbed DeepFont. The idea was to replace the often tedious and time-consuming old methods of selecting typefaces with a far quicker and more accurate point-and-click app.\n\nJust one small problem: It didn\u2019t work. \u201cThe different machine-learning algorithms we used weren\u2019t accurate enough,\u201d Jin says now. DeepFont was only accurate about 50% of the time, and customers expected at least 90%, he says. So Jin and his team went back to the drawing board, trying different technologies that eventually increased the tool\u2019s speed and accuracy. \u201cWe\u2019re over 90% now,\u201d says Jin. \u201c[And] customers like it.\u201d\n\nAt some companies, DeepFont\u2019s initial failure would have relegated it to the dumpster and damaged Jin\u2019s career. Adobe adbe , however, takes a different approach. \u201cIt\u2019s actually ideal when someone\u2019s first attempt at a new product or feature is a failure,\u201d says Mark Randall, the company\u2019s vice president of innovation. \u201cIt teaches people how to respond to what customers need or want\u2014which is often not what you\u2019d expect they want.\u201d\n\nRandall began building what he calls \u201ca whole culture of experimenting\u201d in 2013, when he started giving employees something he invented called Kickbox. An innovation toolkit that walks users through a six-step process of turning an idea into a marketable product, Kickbox is available to anyone who wants to download it, and Randall says hundreds of companies, government agencies, and nonprofits have done so. \u201cIt\u2019s completely free and open-source,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe don\u2019t even ask for your email address.\u201d\n\nOnly about 10% of Adobe\u2019s 14,000 own employees worldwide have used Kickbox and attended workshops on it. \u201cBut 10% is a kind of magical number, because once you get there, everyone in the company knows someone who is trying to innovate,\u201d says Randall. \u201cEven people whose jobs don\u2019t require innovation are exposed to it in some way. It creates a powerful shift in the culture.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, says Jin, who has been at Adobe for 12 years, getting approval for a new product is much faster now. \u201cBefore, you had to get buy-in from your own boss, the product team, and other departments,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, people work on projects without anyone\u2019s approval.\u201d Jin adds that, before Kickbox, \u201crisk taking was allowed. Now, it\u2019s rewarded. That has really changed the way people think.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason why, Randall observes, Adobe\u2019s approach is tough for most companies to embrace. He spends a lot of time talking to managers from elsewhere who want to encourage new ideas, but, he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really work to ask employees to take a risk on something new if the company isn\u2019t risking something, too.\u201d Noting that each Kickbox kit at Adobe contains $1,000 of the company\u2019s money\u2014not to mention the cost of the time employees spend working on projects that may or may not pan out\u2014Randall points out, \u201cWe fund each new idea before we know what it is.\u201d\n\nOther employers struggle with that, he says, and the bigger the organization, the more difficult it is, because trusting people subverts all the control mechanisms. \u201cMany people from big companies have asked me, \u2018Isn\u2019t there some way to let people [use Kickbox] without any risk to the company?\u2019\u201d Randall says. \u201cThe answer is \u2018no\u2019\u2014and in fact, ideally, you want to highlight that element of risk. Make sure everyone knows about it. Let employees know that you\u2019re betting on them to come up with great ideas.\u201d\n\nSo far, that bet seems to be paying off. Thanks partly to a crop of employee inventions that have proven popular with customers, Adobe reported record revenues of $1.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, up 25% from the same period in 2015, and a 48% jump in profits.",

        "text": "Closing Time By Joe Queenan Viking, 338 pages, $26.95\n\nThere is that desolate moment when the pub closes, announced by \"last call\" or the ringing of a bell: The final drink is taken and the cold gray world outside asserts itself again. A grim idea of closing time haunts Joe Queenan's memoir, and not only metaphorically. At 59, Mr. Queenan's life story is far from over, but he seems to feel compelled to look back in anger, as if to close off, for good, a desolate past that keeps reasserting itself and, one can easily imagine, poisoning his present happiness.\n\nThus we are told how Joe and his three sisters grew up in South Philadelphia public housing, the children of hapless Irish Catholic parents: an abusive, frequently unemployed, alcoholic father who was a ninth-grade drop-out and prone to beating his children; and an aloof, \"emotionally inert\" mother who \"sadly looked the other way.\" An altar boy, an early reader of books, Mr. Queenan lists by bitter rote his family's setbacks -- losing a house, heading off to the projects in disgrace. He feared himself doomed to a bad fate.\n\n\"Closing Time\" is in part the story of Mr. Queenan's claim to have won out over such misery and to have arrived at success in writing and a family of his own. But readers of previous Queenan books -- such as \"Balsamic Dreams\" or \"If You're Talking to Me, Your Career Must Be in Trouble\" -- will look here in vain for his trademark humor. Mr. Queenan confesses that, in his college years, his dream \"was to make a living by ridiculing people.\" In a way, he has managed to do just that over the years -- in books, magazine articles and reviews (including many for this newspaper). But his usual quipping self -- so amusingly cruel about the tackier aspects of American culture -- is absent in \"Closing Time.\" The book is an acrid portrait of Mr. Queenan as a man short on forgiveness.\n\nThere is no end to his \"war stories\" of squalor and deprivation. The father urinates in the sink. The family is forced to go on welfare and needs monthly vouchers for allotments of flour, sugar and canned egg yolks. \"One of my earliest memories of the project was being dispatched into streets to gather up cigarette butts for my father.\" The children eat off-brand cornflakes and gnaw on raw spaghetti while \"waiting for my father to come home with his paycheck.\" There is never peace at home. The father, a roaring drunk, always has his strap. \"He beat us often, and he beat us savagely.\"\n\nThe young Mr. Queenan badly thinks in categories, looking warily on the \"snooty neighborhoods\" and casting aspersions on just about everybody: the blacks of North Philly (\"Negro fugitives from the Dixie diaspora\"), the Italians (a \"reputedly shifty ethnic group\"). He confesses his \"contempt for diocesan priests.\" The tone is blue-collar hard, with its prejudices and poltrooneries.\n\nAs for Mr. Queenan's pathways out of the neighborhood as a young man, he describes a brief stay in a Maryknoll seminary, a host of dead-end jobs, a growing interest in literature and classical music, and a series of father surrogates, including semi-benevolent uncles who help him to rise out of the slums. The rise itself, in Mr. Queenan's morbid retelling, is neither thrillingly triumphant nor charmingly self-deprecating. It is instead, too often, suffused with preening -- how amazing the climb has been! And a baleful anger keeps intruding on the story, in spite of the persona that Mr. Queenan insists on giving himself -- that of a music lover, Francophile and man of sensibilities.\n\n\"My father's arsenal consisted of alcohol, brutality, and contempt; I fought back with Apollinaire, Brahms, and condescension,\" Mr. Queenan writes. He can divorce nothing from the father-fight. \"I learned to play basketball,\" he writes, \"partly because my father hated it.\" An injustice-collector, Mr. Queenan remembers every time his father wrong-footed him, from scratching his LPs to almost driving him to suicide (he swallowed some pills at the age of 20). Most of the time his relations with his father -- who died in 1997 at the age of 77 -- take the shape of a grim competition; and \"Closing Time\" is too obviously history written by the winner. When his dying father reaches out, Mr. Queenan rebuffs him: \"I didn't want him hugging me. The nerve-endings he was trying to reach had been dead for thirty-five years. . . . He had done bad things to God's children, and now God was doing bad things to him.\" Mr. Queenan has no trouble whatsoever in seeing himself, but not his father, as one of God's children.\n\nThe literary theme of father-son antagonism can be a great one. One thinks of Edmund Gosse's \"Father and Son\" (1907), in which a man of letters and aesthete looks back on a childhood dominated by a man who was both a remarkable amateur scientist and a dour, overbearing, Plymouth Brethren fundamentalist. \"The comedy was superficial,\" Gosse later wrote of his book, \"and the tragedy essential.\" There is J.R. Ackerley's \"My Father and Myself\" (1968), which is more than anything a search for an elusive (though domineering) father whom his son never really came to know. Except for a rather maudlin coda, \"Closing Time\" has not the grace, understanding and forgiveness of Gosse or the wistful charity of Ackerley. The book is almost suffocating, so obsessively is it dominated by loathing and a clash of temperaments.\n\n\"Which of us does not wish to kill his father?\" asks Ivan Karamazov in \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" Mr. Queenan more than once expressly does wish his father dead. He writes of himself and his siblings: \"We talked about him as if he were already dead; such wishful thinking was rooted in the hope that he would kick the bucket before reaching the age when he might expect one of us to take him in, because even though none of us was ever going to open our doors to him, one of us would have to draw the short straw and tell him that.\"\n\nAt the end of the book, with his father gone, Mr. Queenan adds almost parenthetically: \"We never said good-bye. I do not remember the last words we exchanged.\" He also writes: \"Clemency was not included in my limited roster of emotions.\" It is a shameful confession to make in any book.\n\nHard feelings appear to have affected Mr. Queenan's prose, normally popular but here windy and even awkward. \"But then again, he had always been susceptible to periodic bouts of brain fever, during which he attempted to rearrogate to himself that vast array of paternal rights he had long since abdicated.\" Or: \"Be that as it may, my spiel manifested an edifying, if jejune, savoir faire.\"\n\nIn the end, it is hard not to conclude that \"Closing Time\" was a book that Mr. Queenan felt he had to write -- for his own demon-chasing purposes. Its urgency will be less apparent to the rest of us.\n\nMr. Theroux's latest novel is \"Laura Warholic: Or, The Sexual Intellectual\" (Fantagraphics).",

But he has found his voice again since learning that Bernie Sanders is interested in his plight.\n\n\u201cI am a big-time Sanders fan and I hope he can help us,\u201d said the 37-year-old assembly specialist. \u201cBut even if he can\u2019t, maybe we can stop this happening to other American workers.\u201d\n\nThe Feb. 9 announcement by United Technologies Corp\u2019s Carrier unit that it would shift production to Mexico from Indianapolis has thrust the long-term trend of U.S. manufacturing job decline to the foreground of the nation\u2019s election year agenda.\n\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump seized on the announcement to amplify his position that companies such as Carrier should be taxed if they send jobs to low wage countries.\n\nDemocratic candidate Sanders called Carrier, a maker of air conditioners, an \u201cexample of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers.\u201d The 2016 U.S. presidential election is in November.\n\nCommunities around Indianapolis have witnessed a steady outflow of factory jobs over the past two decades. What made this action different was a YouTube video of the workers getting the news that by Thursday afternoon had more than 3.4 million views, and the political reaction to it.\n\n\u201cI came here 30 years ago looking for the American dream,\u201d said Hatice Lancaster, 51, originally from Turkey. \u201cMaybe I should have gone to Mexico instead.\u201d\n\nChuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents the Carrier workers, said he hopes to use the attention to force Carrier to reverse its decision.\n\nJones faces a steep climb. Carrier has told the union it can pay Mexican workers $3 an hour versus more than $20 on average in Indianapolis. A spokeswoman for Carrier said the company pays a \u201ccompetitive wage\u201d based on local conditions and could not discuss pay levels.\n\nSince 1998, the chain-smoking, plain-spoken and profane Jones has watched the number of factories represented by his local dwindle to 12 from 38. He and his staff can rattle off the names of plants that have closed.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.\u201d\n\nJones is now giving interviews to anyone who asks \u2013 he was interrupted by multiple phone calls seeking comment while talking to Reuters \u2013 in the hope \u201cthis time America will pay attention and do something about rampant corporate greed.\u201d\n\nJones is grateful that Trump has drawn public attention to Carrier, but he sees Sanders \u201cas a champion for our cause.\u201d Jones said he has been contacted by the Sanders campaign. A member of the Sanders campaign said the Vermont senator\u2019s team would be in touch with Jones.\n\nSome Carrier workers interviewed outside the plant said they are drawn to Trump.\n\nBrian Easton, 45, said he and his wife work for Carrier, and are now coming to terms with what he said is likely to be a permanent drop in their living standard.\n\n\u201cThis country is run by Corporate America and we need someone in office like Donald Trump who is not beholden to anyone,\u201d Easton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can save our jobs, but if we draw attention to this perhaps other workers won\u2019t have to go through this.\u201d",

        "text": "Ever since the European Union\u2019s top court ruled in May that individuals have a \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d Google has been working to abide by the new rules. The company has received over 70,000 takedown requests from individuals who want 250,000 webpages removed from Google\u2019s search results. Google\u2019s team individually reviews each application, and the company plans to hire more employees to handle the extra workload. Changing the way people think about the Internet is an overwhelming task.\n\nBut Google is not the only company scrambling in the wake of the E.U.\u2019s decision. As Internet users begin requesting that unsavory parts of their pasts or personal contact information be erased from Google\u2019s search results, so-called reputation management companies are seeing a flood of new business. Traditionally confined to creating new web content about their clients\u2014laudatory blog posts, celebratory articles, swooning social media updates\u2014these companies are now trying to help their clients erase content as well. \u201cOnline image management has long been in the business of producing new content so you have a better persona online,\u201d says Cayce Myers, a professor at Virginia Tech and legal research editor for the Institute for Public Relations. \u201cHere they\u2019re doing the reverse.\u201d\n\nOnline reputation management is a growing business that is now being boosted by the E.U. ruling. For a fee that can amount to thousands of dollars a month, companies take on clients and scrub clean their search results by creating search engine-optimized content that hog up the first few pages of search results on Google. Clients ranging from CEOs, major corporations, celebrities down to doctors and restaurateurs who use the services to whitewash their online presence. Media consultant BIA/Kelsey forecasts that small and medium-size businesses will spend $3.5 billion managing their online reputations in 2014.\n\nNow, the E.U.\u2019s court ruling has changed the dynamics of the industry, expanding these businesses\u2019 client base and making it easier for them to delete content rather than just create it. \u201cThe number of our inbound leads\u201d\u2014new referrals\u2014\u201chas gone up about 50 percent since the beginning of May,\u201d says Simon Wadsworth, managing director of the U.K.-based online reputation management firm Igniyte. The E.U. ruling \u201chas raised awareness of the industry. You can change how you do things online.\u201d\n\nBertrand Girin, the founder of a France-based reputation management company, Reputation VIP, has created a spin-off service that specifically to designed to help people make \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests to Google. Aptly named Forget.Me, it lets users choose from one of 40 boilerplate requests in nine separate categories in order to send Google a pre-formulated request. The service, which is free, allows users to bypass some of the thorny legal questions and the difficulty of properly structuring a request. \u201cWhen Google put its form online, we looked at the demand from the public and we saw a gap,\u201d says Girin. \u201cWe said, \u2018let\u2019s help people understand what their problem is.\u2019\u201d\n\nForget.me has 17,000 registered users who have submitted over 2,500 applications to Google. The boilerplate response responses, which were written by lawyers, can be modified by users to address more specific claims. Girin is promoting the service as one that makes it easy for regular people to be forgotten on the internet. Dealing with Google is a \u201cbureaucratic hassle,\u201d says Myers, the legal research editor for the Institute for Public Relations.\u201dYou can technically do it yourself for free, but navigating the bureaucracy is in a state of flux.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see where it could be cumbersome,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe buzz around right to be forgotten has given these companies much-wanted attention. Andy Donaldson, the CEO of the reputation management company Hit Search, has invested heavily in building and marketing a search software that allowed users to monitor their own online personas over multiple platforms. But Donaldson said that since the E.U. ruling, the number of his company\u2019s new client leads has increased by \u201cupwards of three or four hundred.\u201d \u201cWe invested in post-graduate doctors in computer science and mathematics to help us build our algorithm,\u201d Donaldson said, \u201cBut it ends up being something like this that triggers the market that\u2019s really totally out of our control.\u201d\n\nDonaldson gave an example of how the E.U. ruling has been a boon for business. (He couldn\u2019t disclose the names of his clients.) The CEO of a large U.K.-based company was involved in a dispute during a friendly rugby match with a well-known journalist. The journalist wrote a damning story about the incident, blaming the CEO. The CEO\u2019s wife, having just read about the E.U. ruling, sought out Hit Search to get the story removed from Google\u2019s search results. The request is unlikely to be successful\u2014Google is reticent about removing news stories on public persons\u2014but Donaldson won a client lead.\n\nGoogle has taken a hard-nosed stance toward many of the requests reputation management firms have made, with the overwhelming number of takedown requests coming back with refusals. Donaldson said he has sent hundreds of requests for his clients to Google; of the requests Google has responded to, under ten percent have been accepted, he says. That\u2019s because Google isn\u2019t likely to take down a search result like a newspaper story about a public figure, for instance, or a negative review about a roofing company.\n\n\u201cPeople think we\u2019ve got some magic button in Google and we press delete,\u201d says Wadsworth, the CEO of Igniyte. His clients often ask for links to be removed that won\u2019t pass Google\u2019s bar. \u201cWe\u2019re telling the majority of people, \u2018you\u2019ve got no chance,\u2019\u201d Wadsworth says.\n\nTheir success rates aside, the right to be forgotten ruling is going to drive business growth for some time to come. \u201cThis is a first step into a general public market. It\u2019s a big market,\u201d said Girin. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real demand here.\u201d",

        "text": "Gordon Parks is one of America\u2019s most celebrated photographers. He is also one of the most misunderstood. Museums and galleries around the world have celebrated him as the creator of some of the 20th century\u2019s most iconic images. Yet to appreciate only his achievements as an artist is to underestimate his importance as a documentary photographer and journalist. The photo essays Parks produced, primarily for LIFE magazine from the 1940s to the 1970s, on issues relating to poverty and social justice, established him as one of the era\u2019s most significant interpreters of American society. His peers were writers like Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin as much as they were LIFE photographers like Margaret Bourke-White and W. Eugene Smith. Visual Justice: The Gordon Parks Photography Collection at Wichita State University, an exhibition at the Ulrich Museum of Art (for which I served as senior project advisor), examines photographs from six of his most powerful photo essays, enriching our understanding of his work in its historical context.\n\nIn interviews and in his memoirs, Parks, who passed away in 2006, always emphasized that there was \u201cno special black man\u2019s corner\u201d for him at LIFE. He was as comfortable photographing celebrities, Paris fashions and Benedictine monks as he was an impoverished family in Harlem and Black Panther Party members in Oakland. Photographs which are far removed from pressing social concerns make up part of Visual Justice. Yet, as its title suggests, the photo essays that grapple with social justice are at the heart of the exhibition.\n\n\u201cHarlem Gang Leader,\u201d from 1948, was Parks\u2019 second major assignment for LIFE. Parks spent a month with 17-year-old Red Jackson, the teenaged gang leader of the story\u2019s title, and other members of the Midtowners gang. His goal, he once said, was to show that juvenile delinquents were teenagers whose lives could be turned around if the right social service agencies intervened. As Russell Lord, a curator at the New Orleans Museum of Art, has shown, Parks discovered that when he turned in his film to LIFE\u2019s laboratories, he ceded control of his story to the magazine\u2019s editors. While the tone of the published photo essay was generally sympathetic to Jackson and the other gang members, it emphasized violence and slighted the potential for rehabilitation. Parks learned his lesson. His eagerness to write the text that accompanied his future photographs reflected his desire to assert more control over their message.\n\nParks was one of LIFE\u2019s best known and most admired photographers by the time that \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Day Is Almost Over,\u201d his photo essay about the Black Muslims, appeared in 1963. His star status allowed him to exert more control over his story than he had over previous stories. The result was a nuanced and finely textured photo essay that challenged conventional wisdom about the group. Visual Justice contains 30 of the photographs that Parks made, most never before published or exhibited, during the three months he worked on the assignment, traveling from New York to Los Angeles, with stops in Chicago and Phoenix. They portray a religious community that is far different from the dangerous collection of fanatics that television and the press usually depicted. They emphasize the importance of family, faith and disciplined, peaceful protest. Many of the images show Malcolm X, who was Parks\u2019 guide through the world of the Black Muslims, in a variety of roles\u2014spokesman, prayer leader, amateur photographer.\n\nIn 1968, Parks\u2019 editors challenged him to show them (and LIFE\u2019s readers) the roots of the anger and frustration that were then so evident in the African American community. In \u201cA Harlem Family,\u201d his subjects were the Fontenelles, a family whose lives were battered by menial jobs, poor schools and wretched living conditions. Their plight tortured Parks, who often found himself buying food for them. Darkness and despair pervade the photographs. Plaster peels from the walls of the family\u2019s apartment; children huddle under blankets for daytime warmth; the father stares blankly into a void.\n\nIn the pages of LIFE, \u201cA Harlem Family\u201d began not with a photograph, but with a prose-poem by Parks. Speaking in the voice of black America, he asked his readers, whom he understood to be white, to \u201cLook at me. Listen to me. Try to understand my struggle against your racism.\u201d Parks hoped to provoke a response, and he got it. Hundreds of letters, now preserved in the Gordon Parks Papers at Wichita State University, poured into the magazine\u2019s offices. Some were hostile, blaming the Fontenelles for their own misery. Many were sympathetic, however, expressing concern and asking how to help the family. Readers sent money. Their contributions were enough, in fact, that when LIFE topped them off, the Fontenelles were able to move out of Harlem and into a new apartment in Queens. But tragedy followed them. In the spring of 1969, LIFE reported that a fire had broken out in the family\u2019s new home and that the father, Norman, and a son, Kenneth, had died. In his memoirs, Parks described the overwhelming guilt he felt for their fate. He stayed in touch with them until the end of his life, offering them a hand whenever they needed it.\n\nParks was a man of many pursuits\u2014photographer, novelist, poet, memoirist, filmmaker, composer. But he is most remembered as a photographer. And while some of his images live on because they delight the eye with their beauty, others endure because of the way that they touched the hearts and minds of millions of LIFE\u2019s readers and changed, if only just a little, the course of American history.",

Both wireless carriers and Internet companies alike are making big bets that you will soon, generating more traffic and revenue in the process.\n\nBut most Web sites aren\u2019t ready to receive mobile visitors: Complex designs and intense graphics often turn conventional Web pages into gibberish on phones or other mobile devices.\n\nNow, an upstart group hopes to change that by promoting a new Web address and set of design standards it says will make the Internet more accessible for users with tiny, portable screens.\n\nIn May, Dublin-based Mobile Top Level Domain will start taking registrations for \u201c.mobi\u201d Internet addresses, joining the familiar .com, .net and international domains such as Japan\u2019s .jp and the European Union\u2019s .eu suffix. Registrants that want to use .mobi addresses will have to overhaul their sites to make sure they work as well on a cell-phone screen as PC. If they don\u2019t, their address\u2013and their business\u2013will be put on hold.\n\nLed by General Manager Neil Edwards, the group hopes to tap into a growing U.S. mobile data marketplace that reached $8.3 billion last year, according to the Yankee Group. Edwards, who spent six years as vice president at VeriSign\u2018s Network Solutions group, says the new domain\u2019s accessibility standards could help spark more mobile Web traffic.\n\n\u201cTaking the Internet as we know it with content built for a PC with broadband and a .com address just doesn\u2019t work for mobile phones,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople are going to trust .mobi because they know it works and it works fast and cost-effectively.\u201d\n\nMobile phones have tiny screens that make Web browsing difficult, but that\u2019s not their only limitation. The devices usually have cruder browsers than their PC counterparts and can have trouble with large graphics and embedded multimedia. Streamlined .mobi sites are supposed to make the Web pages easier and faster to load.\n\nWeb sites don\u2019t have to use a .mobi address to accommodate wireless users. Many of the Internet\u2019s most popular Web sites, such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com , already have slimmed-down versions for cell-phone browsers.\n\nIn many cases, users need to find the mobile edition manually, but some companies have also set up redirection commands that automatically send phone surfers to the lo-fi version. Still, actual mileage may vary: In an informal test, Time Warner\u2018s AOL.com seamlessly redirected a user with a two-year-old Sony Ericsson T610 on T-Mobile\u2019s network to its mobile site, but balked when approached by a higher-tech Dell Axim X30 mobile device. An AOL rep says that mobile users should head directly to mobile.aol.com to avoid any issues.\n\nEarly .mobi backers include Web content giants such as Google , which already has its google.mobi site up and running, and Microsoft , whose Windows Mobile operating system powers many of the newest smartphones and palmtops in the U.S. Other .mobi sponsors include device mobile manufacturers Nokia and Samsung and mobile carriers such as Deutsche Telekom\u2018s T-Mobile, Telecom Italia Mobile and Vodafone , which, along with Verizon Communications , owns Verizon Wireless in the U.S.\n\nWill .mobi catch on? Most Web users still associate Internet browsing with .com addresses, with good reason: According to VeriSign, almost half of the 85.6 million domain names registered worldwide in late 2005 were .com addresses.\n\n\u201cThere is a definite and strongly held perception out there that you have to have .com to do business online,\u201d says David Melancon, North America president of FutureBrand, a New York-based branding firm.\n\nBut Melancon says as it becomes harder to get elite .com addresses, that perception will have to change. While he isn\u2019t sold on .mobi, he says a company\u2019s Internet address will become a less important part of their brand in the future.\n\n\u201cWe got used to dialing ten phone digits instead of seven, and we will easily get used to this as well,\u201d he says. \u201cWith more and more addresses, \u2018something-dot-com\u2019 as a brand is going to start to lose power.\u201d\n\nComments are turned off for this post.",

We are all outraged,\" Ryan said. \"An attack on the people who protect us is an attack on all of us.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican bemoaned the \"long month\" of violence for America and the \"terrible, senseless things\" the nation has seen since June.\n\n\"Who could have fathomed such horror as this?\" he said of the five deceased Dallas officers and the several more injured. \"There's no cause or context in which this violence, this kind of terror is justified. None at all.\"\n\nThe speaker also warned against seeing the crimes as a reason for further divisions in America.\n\n\"There will be a temptation for anger to harden our divisions. Let's not let that happen. There is going to be a temptation to let our anger send us further into our corners. Let's not let that happen,\" he said. \"A few perpetrators of evil do not represent us. They do not control us. The blame lies with those that committed these vicious acts and no one else.\"\n\nRyan alluded to last month's heated gun control debate in his address, noting that \"every member\" of Congress would like to see less violence perpetuated by firearms.\n\n\"Every Republican and every Democrat -- wants to see less gun violence,\" he said. \"Every member of this body wants a world in which people feel safe regardless of the color of their skin. And that's not how people are feeling these days.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that legislative disagreements shouldn't fuel rifts, urging unity despite policy differences on gun control.\n\n\"Sometimes we disagree passionately on how to get there -- but in having this debate, let's not lose sight of the values that unite us,\" Ryan said. \"Let's not lose sight in our common humanity.\"\n\n\"If we lose those fundamental things, what's left?\" he added. \"We need to take a moment here for reflection, for thought, for prayer, for justice, for action. Right now, let's let justice be done. And also let some healing occur too.\"\n\nRyan's comments come after a weeks-long partisan standoff in Congress over gun control legislation. Democrats renewed their call for legislative action after the mass slaying of dozens at a gay nightclub in Orlando last month.\n\nThough Ryan planned to hold a House vote earlier this week on gun control measures that would have restricted purchases by suspected terrorists, the House speaker backed away from scheduling it this week.\n\nHe said Wednesday that the House would vote on it \"when we're ready,\" adding that \"we have members from both sides of the aisle who want to make improvements, who want to make changes to the bill.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, followed Ryan on the House floor, thanking the families of those police officers that gave their lives Thursday night.\n\n\"We pray that it is a comfort to you that so many people mourn your loss and are praying for you at this sad time,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe California Democrat also called for \"mercy\" in the wake of the recent shootings, adding to Ryan's call for justice.\n\n\"I associate myself with the remark of our Speaker when he referenced our president. 'Justice will be done. Justice must be done,'\" Pelosi said. \"We must also [have] mercy. Mercy must be done.\"\n\n\"We have to get to the facts and to the root causes of what caused these tragedies,\" she continued. \"We must continue the work of nonviolence and demand an end to senseless killing everywhere.\"",

        "text": "He led millions of voters to feel the Bern. On Monday night in Philadelphia, the Democratic Party needed Bernie Sanders to keep the blaze under control.\n\nBy the end of the night \u2014 well, the house was still standing. But it was a journey to get there, and the acrimony played out on television before the convention even started.\n\nDays ago, you might have guessed this convention would be smooth \u2014 or boring \u2014 compared with the raucous smack-down festival that emerged in Cleveland from Donald J. Trump\u2019s smoke machine.\n\nThat changed with the release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, which showed members of the committee plainly taking sides with Hillary Clinton and against Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, during the campaign.\n\nCarefully bandaged wounds were ripped open, delegates were in open revolt and one of the first targets of hostility from Sanders backers was Senator Sanders himself. When he reiterated his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton to the delegates early Monday afternoon, the room erupted, and to paraphrase \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d they were not shouting \u201cFeel the boo-erns.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who may have felt smug when Republicans booed Senator Ted Cruz during prime time for not endorsing the party\u2019s nominee were now worried their runner-up would be booed in prime time for endorsing.\n\nIt was real-time couples\u2019 counseling in public. The Democrats scrubbed the departing committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, from the program, yet delegates booed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name and chanted \u201cBernie! Bernie!\u201d during the opening invocation prayer. Would the room explode every time someone named the nominee for four days? It was devolving into a total shout show.\n\nThe room cooled a bit as the cable networks went into prime time, and the first hour focused on emotional, personal stories from nonpoliticians, pointedly including undocumented immigrants, mostly cast at the Republican convention as murderous invaders.\n\nBut there was still an unsettled tone \u2014 outbursts and competing chants in the hall, the sense that one wrong word could set everything off.\n\nThe comedian Sarah Silverman, who supported Senator Sanders in the primaries, spoke with Senator Al Franken of Minnesota (formerly a comic himself) and united the crowd against Mr. Trump, whose behavior Ms. Silverman described as \u201cI\u2019m still emotionally 4 and calling people names from my gold-encrusted sandbox.\u201d\n\nBut as Mr. Franken and Ms. Silverman were asked to vamp for time before the next act, Paul Simon, the crowd turned restive. The duo tried to counter more \u201cBernie\u201d chanting (Mr. Franken went with \u201cHillary,\u201d Ms. Silverman with \u201cunity\u201d; neither worked). Then Ms. Silverman went into dealing-with-hecklers mode. \u201cCan I just say to the \u2018Bernie-or- bust\u2019 people,\u201d she said, pausing to shoot a look, \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d\n\nFinally, Mr. Simon sang \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water.\u201d Maybe \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d would have seemed like wishful thinking.\n\nBut Mr. Simon\u2019s lullaby felt like more than crowd control. The protests were noisy, but the first night\u2019s planned program had a distinctly different tone from the Republican convention, which exhorted the faithful to embrace their anger. (\u201cGuilty!\u201d \u201cLock her up!\u201d) It was going after different emotions and using different rhetoric: tear-jerking rather than raging grief, mockery rather than prosecution.\n\nThe tone seemed to be part of a larger argument, a kind of recasting of Republican attacks against political correctness. In Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview and his convention\u2019s, mealy-mouthed P.C. Democrats refused to call things the way they saw them and name dangers for what they are.\n\nThe Democrats argued back that the way you say things is a mark of character. Footage of Mr. Trump mocking a disabled reporter played over and over. Speakers repeatedly called out Mr. Trump\u2019s insult-comic campaign, calling him a bad role model for children. \u201cYou can\u2019t love your country,\u201d said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, \u201cwithout loving your countrymen and countrywomen.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama, the first of three headline speakers, was emotional, valedictory and hopeful as she described watching her daughters \u2014 \u201ctwo beautiful, intelligent black young women\u201d \u2014 playing with their dogs on the lawn of the White House, which was built by slaves. She rebutted Mr. Trump without using his name, playing against his slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d: \u201cThis, right now, is the greatest country on earth.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the Democratic National Convention, the comedian Sarah Silverman told delegates continuing to back Bernie Sanders that they were \u201cbeing ridiculous.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to delight Bill Clinton, the former president and political maven, whom the CNN camera presented in split-screen as a human, partisan applause-o-meter through the night. At times he seemed to zone out, but when he\u2019s engaged, Mr. Clinton consumes a speech the way Guy Fieri does a sandwich.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts served the red meat, in a scathing keynote that redeployed many attacks she\u2019s goaded Mr. Trump with on the campaign trail. Still, you could hear Bernistas chanting \u201cWe trusted you!\u201d\n\nIt was time for Senator Sanders to enter the lion\u2019s den he helped build.\n\nHe has been one of the memorable figures of 2016, but you would not describe him as a calming one. Compared with past movement leaders \u2014 Barack Obama, say \u2014 he\u2019s a forceful rather than lyrical speaker, his voice a Brooklyn-style poke in the chest, his music power chords rather than soaring arpeggios.\n\nBut in the moment, that was what brought the room together: a pugilistic, greatest-hits speech that framed his near-win as a historic and practical victory for the left. He collected protracted cheers and led his followers through catharsis \u2014 there were a lot of tear-stained faces on camera \u2014 to, if not acceptance, some later stage of grief. He declared that \u201cHillary Clinton will make an outstanding president\u201d and lived to tell the tale.\n\nMrs. Clinton herself was an offstage presence, unlike Mr. Trump, who made a the-mothership-has-landed appearance the first night of his convention. She was talked about (adjectives like \u201ctenacious\u201d were popular) and seen on video. She\u2019ll have to get onstage eventually, and that will test how much healing Monday\u2019s talk therapy really achieved.\n\nBut by the end of prime time, the Democrats looked and sounded happier than they did that afternoon, their discord, if not totally assuaged, at least politically corrected.",
        "generated": "The first night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia was marked by tension and discord, as supporters of Bernie Sanders protested and booed Hillary Clinton's name, but the mood shifted towards unity as the night progressed, with Sanders himself endorsing Clinton and giving a powerful speech.",

        "text": "\u2018Books succeed, / And lives fail,\u201d reads an epigraph (from Elizabeth Barrett Browning) to this biography of Blanche Knopf, who founded the eponymous publishing house in 1915 with her husband, Alfred. It\u2019s a good epigraph\u2014the whole story in a nutshell. The legendary couple appeared to have exactly two things in common: a love of dogs (hence the borzoi colophon) and a desire to publish good books. They began modestly with such disparate titles as \u201cThe Book of Camping\u201d and an anonymous monograph about Ezra Pound, written by T.S. Eliot before he was T.S. Eliot. A reprint of W.H. Hudson\u2019s 1904 novel, \u201cGreen Mansions,\u201d ensured their survival, but it was Blanche\u2019s peculiar astuteness that led to the 1923 publication of Kahlil Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet,\u201d whose modest initial sales would metastasize 40 years later, in the woo-woo \u201960s, helping to lift Knopf into the commercial big-time.\n\nBy the time Blanche died, in 1966, 27 Knopf authors had won the Pulitzer and 16 the Nobel\u2014an astounding record, all the more so given the relatively humble scale of the operation. Only a dozen or so Knopf books sold more than 100,000 copies in those early decades, whereas larger houses such as Doubleday and Simon & Schuster published several best sellers a year. Indeed, it is Laura Claridge\u2019s emphatic thesis, in \u201cThe Lady and the Borzoi,\u201d that Knopf waxed in prestige all but entirely because of its indefatigable matriarch. Not only a \u201csuperb editor of fiction and poetry,\u201d Blanche was also an expert schmoozer who cultivated the advice of her good friends, Carl Van Vechten and H.L. Mencken, while beguiling an international Who\u2019s Who of 20th-century literature: Freud, Mann, Cather, Camus, et al. This, as Ms. Claridge would have it, was almost in spite of her philistine husband, more of a salesman type who read, if at all, the odd history book.\n\nAlfred would have disagreed. Though he\u2019d made a \u201cprenuptial verbal pact\u201d with his wife that they would be equal partners, he was already air-brushing her out of the picture five years later, in 1920, when he printed a booklet of accolades to himself written by Knopf authors whom his wife had largely courted. Ms. Claridge finds a reference, in publisher Desmond Flower\u2019s memoir, to Blanche\u2019s suicide attempt while a guest chez Flower and thus opines (\u201cIt seems possible\u201d) that Blanche was despondent over being omitted from Alfred\u2019s fifth-anniversary Festschrift. If so, her cry for help went unheeded. \u201cDuring the last 20 years,\u201d Alfred announced 15 years later in the Borzoi Quarterly, \u201cI have introduced to America many writers so far ahead of their times that even competent critics found difficulty in adequately appraising their worth and the importance of my discoveries.\u201d Even competent critics! Be that as it may, hope springs eternal, and again, in 1948, Blanche looked forward to a three-part New Yorker magazine profile that promised to belie, at last, her husband\u2019s fondness for the first person. Its title, however, was enough to disabuse her: \u201cPublisher,\u201d singular.\n\nThe florid subtitle of Ms. Claridge\u2019s book, \u201cBlanche Knopf, Literary Tastemaker Extraordinaire,\u201d might as well have been, \u201cAlfred Knopf, Nonpareil Douchebag.\u201d His employees remembered him as insensitive, at best, and a skinflint to boot. It took all of Blanche\u2019s wiles to attract great writers despite the invariably mean royalty advances offered by her husband, who believed that the cachet of Knopf was its own reward. Perhaps it goes without saying that he had a ghastly temper, too, and was a brutal father to their only son, Pat, who remembered beatings with razor straps when Alfred wasn\u2019t occupied with beating his wife. That Alfred hardly bothered with other conjugal offices was probably a relief. In any case, Blanche\u2019s roster of lovers was almost as impressive as her publishing list, though in the first case she favored musicians: Leopold Stokowski, Jascha Heifetz, Benno Moiseiwitsch and Serge Koussevitzky, to name a few. \u201cMarriage is a useful institution for society, especially where there are children,\u201d she told a socialist newspaper, the New York Call. \u201cBut other than caring together for their offspring, marital partners should be free to go their own way.\u201d And so they did, keeping separate homes in Manhattan (Blanche) and Purchase, N.Y. (Alfred), where Pat chose to live more and more with his abusive father, who lured the growing boy with a furtive supply of prostitutes. One likes to think that this had something to do with his remorse over the razor straps, but Ms. Claridge suggests\u2014correctly, I think\u2014that it was mostly to spite Blanche.\n\nIf all this sounds like a dishy read, well, that\u2019s the idea. \u201cShe ripped through the Roaring Twenties,\u201d Ms. Claridge writes in her introduction, \u201cpartying with friends like the Fitzgeralds and Sinclair Lewis. . . . She maneuvered through World War II by flying into, not away from, battle.\u201d There was a certain amount of partying and maneuvering, I guess, but in fact one doesn\u2019t see much of the Fitzgeralds or Lewis after that first reference (and, from what I hear, partying with Sinclair Lewis wasn\u2019t that much fun), and the book has a kind of stolid quality, for all its emphasis on the lurid. Part of the reason, I think, is an almost total reliance on the research of others: In the \u201970s, Susan Sheehan began working on a book about the Knopfs but decided to put it aside, whereupon the Newsweek critic Peter Prescott took over and plugged away for some 20 years, until he died in 2004 and his wife turned his research over to the Harry Ransom Center in Texas. To be sure, Ms. Claridge brings her own perspective to these materials (Blanche good, Alfred bad), but when she stitches all the limbs together and throws the switch, the creature lurches around and topples over.\n\nI wondered especially why Blanche herself should seem so vague to me\u2014an amorphous lump of neediness and energetic competence. Take those lovers of hers: When the conductor Koussevitzky dies, Ms. Claridge speculates that Blanche \u201cmust have been nostalgic for their shared past.\u201d It may be so, but we know almost nothing about the affair\u2014her most passionate by far, the author assures us\u2014except that it happened, and hence we feel little in the way of nostalgia ourselves. What did these two talk about? At first I figured that Ms. Claridge had been forbidden by the Knopf estate to quote letters, but apparently not: On page 193, for instance, there\u2019s a long if rather inconsequential quote from Blanche to Freud, and 50 pages later the author gives another longish quote compounded mostly of logistical details and a smiley face at the end: \u201cI have a plane out of Guyana to London 3 August which I will postpone a couple of days if I can,\u201d Blanche informs her husband. \u201cI fly to Zurich on the 26th and if I don\u2019t go to Milan I\u2019ll go to Geneva,\u201d etc.\n\nWhy these quotes? Why? Did Blanche never write anything of intimacy or substance? And why quote at any length an obvious form letter from Gen. Eisenhower (\u201cwho was supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe\u201d) in response to some recent Knopf titles that Blanche had cordially sent him? \u201cYour selection includes books which will be invaluable to our staff, drawn from ten nations,\u201d Ike or his amanuensis replies, though he or she might have been bemused by a selection that \u201cprobably\u201d included a 1951 reprint of Ford Madox Ford\u2019s elliptical Modernist classic \u201cThe Good Soldier,\u201d or so Ms. Claridge surmises, given its militaristic title perhaps.\n\nWhat one gleans from all this is that Blanche persevered, and good for her, but at what price? Much is made of her anorexia, both pro and con: The author quotes her \u201cadoring butler\u201d observing that his mistress\u2019s thinness (her ideal weight was around 75 pounds) made her look \u201cvery sexy . . . like Goldie Hawn,\u201d whereas Knopf editor Stanley Kauffmann thought she resembled \u201can expensively attired starveling.\u201d As for Alfred, it gave him yet another pretext for cruelty, as he would exploit her lack of body fat by refusing to throw logs on the fire until she positively begged, whereupon he would oblige her and put on a bathing suit. In the end, though, it\u2019s safe to say that Blanche managed to step a little out of this ogre\u2019s shadow. How do we know? Reader, if you have tears, prepare to shed them now. \u201cThis is very sad news for a lot of us,\u201d Eric Sevareid telegraphed, we are told, on hearing of her demise. \u201cIt makes me realize again how much Blanche did for me and so many writing friends of mine.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mr. Bailey is working on a biography of Philip Roth.",

My supervisor asking me why I care about doing a good job,\" said Minnery.He was reassigned and says officials then covered up the problem by just writing it off.\"They have to cover it up,\" he said. \"That's where the corruption comes in.

Make way for new ones. What happens when they get the address wrong and knock down your home instead? Tonight abc's jim avila on the fight playing out right now should these home wreckers have to pay up? You'd be surprised. New dining room will have -- Reporter: It was supposed to be the retirement home of their dreams. Soon to be empty-nesters david and valerie underwood had a grand plan, to fix up this ft. Worth house and move in. It had been david's grandmother's, a gathering place for family holidays, filled with cherished memories. That was our first third-generation christmas. Reporter: Then last summer, after hiring architects and builders, the underwoods drove by to check out the condition of their lawn. I've got mowing, weeding to do. But -- Reporter: Then a shocking discovery. Something was missing. Right about here she taps me and goes, \"david, the house is gone.\" Reporter: It's totally gone. It's totally gone. It's totally gone. It was surreal. Reporter: That's right. The lakeside view was intact. But the 1,200-square-foot home gone. Where are we kind of standing? This was the garage, and the living room was right over. The bedrooms were back on that edge of the house. That was the patio. Reporter: How on earth could a house just vanish into thin air? Believe it or not, the city had bulldozed it by mistake. They even took pictures of their handiwork. I was just shocked, like you know, what in the world? Like, how do you tear down the wrong house? Reporter: The underwoods' house is 9716, clearly marked on their mailbox. The right house, the one the city was supposed to demolish, was next door at 9708. But somehow the brain trust at city hall managed to mess that up. And in today's world of gps, when you can spot something the size of a nickel, I would think that -- you can. -- That there would be a fail-safe. Reporter: A onetime occurrence? Actually no, according to real estate mogul barbara corcoran. It happens more than you think. You could probably find at least one home wrecked in just about every city across the united states by mistake. Reporter: Demolishing the wrong house is actually hard to do, according to new jersey contractor lou santora. It's basically just completing a mountain of paperwork. Letters from your asbestos compan the gas company, the water company. If you're a competent contractor things like this shouldn't happen. Reporter: That's small comfort to andre hall. He figured he had the wrong address when he saw a backhoe tearing down a house. I was like, \"oh, somebody's house is getting knocked down. It can't be mine.\" I drove around the block and came back, and it was my house. I was just in shock. Reporter: He had poured his heart and soul into fixing up the pittsburgh house, prepping it so his three daughters could move from living with their mom out of state to be with him. I put new glass, put new frames, new windows. I did everything I had to do to get this house right. Reporter: He even painted his daughters rooms. There's no place like home. And now for hall, that's way too true, because there's no home period. It's gone now. It ain't nothing but an open lot. Reporter: Hall hit rock bottom. Today he lives in an apartment without his daughters. Nobody wants to take the blame. The contctor points the finger at the city. The city points the finger at the contractor. Reporter: You'd think when your house gets bulldozed by mistake you'd get compensated, and quickly, but you'd be wrong. Jessie vernon is a good example. Here are pictures of his little rock house being demolished last year. The city-hired contractor admitted to a local tv station that he made a big bulldozer blunder. There were two houses side by side, and I didn't look close enough to figure out which is which. Reporter: But adding insult to injury, vernon has not been paid neither by city nor by the contractor. And listen to this bold reasoning from the contractor's attorney. They say they did vernon a favor. I think mr. Vernon actually benefited from what my client did. And I'll be glad -- Reporter: He knocked down the house and benefited from it? That can be made to sound terrible, and normally I assume it would be. Reporter: Well, if it was your house, you would think it was terrible. Surely. Surely. But the city had told mr. Vernon months before this to either get a permit to fix this house up or to demolish it. My client just hastened what was probably inevitable. Reporter: But that's not your client's decision to make. He can't undo it. You can't unring the bell at this point. Reporter: But vernon says he was planning to repair the house to rent it out. Vernon went to a city council meeting to try to get justice. Good evening, I'm jessie vernon. Reporter: No luck. Mr. Vernon's and the city's interests are not aligned. Reporter: File that under legal talk for \"sorry, chump.\" We had to ask a few questions. Is it really not your fault? You have no responsibility for this? The people you hired knocked down the wrong house. Yeah. The people we hired didn't do what we hired them to do. No, I don't think that we have a legal responsibility for that. Reporter: So if I hired somebody to knock down my porch, and they knocked down my neighbor's porch, don't you think my neighbor's going to come after me, not just the guy who knocked down the porch? Well, I think so. But you don't have immunity from negligence actions, as local governdo. Reporter: Wait, come again? You don't have immunity from negligence actions, as local governments do. Reporter: You heard right. Some local governments are off the hook from lawsuits. So if they hire a bungling backhoe that happens to flatten your home sweet home you're on your own. Where does that leave vernon? The city advised him to sue the errant contractor. It would cost me money to sue. And I shouldn't have to pay a dime. All I've heard is talk. Reporter: Back in ft. Worth, talk is all david underwood has been hearing, too, even though the city admitted they made the error. In a statement to \"20/20,\" they said they have -- \"reviewed city policies and procedures and added a series of additional checks.\" But they still haven't paid a check to underwood. You must be a little ticked off by now, right? Well, frustration's growing. Reporter: Especially since for the years that the city was collecting taxes on the house, before it was demolished, it was appraised for $82,000. But now that the city might have to pay for the wrecked house there's a new appraisal for just 25 grand. You can't buy a car for that, much less a house, right? Exactly. Reporter: We wanted to ask the city about that, and since they wouldn't talk to us on camera we went straight to city hall to confront underwood's councilman. Hi, I'm jim avila. From abc news 20/20. Nice to meet you. Are you disappointed at all that the city has not come forward when they admitted they made the mistake? We are going to settle with this gentleman, but there has been some discourse over total settlement value, and that's where it's at right now. Reporter: But has the assessment been reduced in order to pay him, pay him a lower amount? I can't answer that. No, absolutely not. Reporter: The underwoods still hope they can salvage their dream house, rebuild. But the memories they had, those have been demolished. And so what is left of your dream at this point? Uh -- it's a new dream. It's a new vision. It's a -- yeah. We're going to have to build a totally new house now. There's not going to be that tie to my childhood. It did mean something to me, obviously. If I'd want it torn down, I'd have torn it down. A lot of fingers pointed in this one. Who should pay? The contractor or the town that hired them?

Among the companies founded by Stanford alums receiving venture capital funding in recent years is flash-sale style home decor website One Kings Lane, which was founded by Stanford grad Susan Feldman along with Alison Pincus, the wife of Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus. Another Stanford grad, Clara Shih \u2014 a former Fortune \u201c40 Under 40\u2033 member who also serves on Starbucks\u2019 board \u2014 co-founded social media marketing management service Hearsay Social with former Microsoft engineer Steve Garrity.\n\nWhen it comes to MBA programs, Harvard tops the list with 56 female founders receiving funding over the past five years. Companies springing up recently that are led by female Harvard MBA\u2019s include beauty and grooming products delivery service Birchbox, founded by Harvard MBAs Hayley Barna and Katia Beauchamp, which recently raised $60 million in a Series B funding. Another company on the list is personal styling for women website Stitch Fix, which was founded in 2011 by Katrina Lake, who actually has degrees from both Stanford and Harvard.\n\nHarvard also came in third on the list of undergraduate programs with 29 female-founder alums dating back to 2009, finishing behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its 31 female founders during that same period. MIT finished third on Pitchbook\u2019s list of MBA programs with female alums receiving VC funding over the past five years. MIT had 23 during that period, behind Stanford\u2019s 31.\n\nOf course, those three schools aren\u2019t just churning out female entrepreneurs. Stanford, Harvard and MIT also placed in the top five (for both undergraduates and MBAs) in a separate Pitchbook list ranking schools by the number of company founders of all genders that they produced. That the schools fared well on both lists \u2014 again, Stanford topped the undergraduate list, while Harvard\u2019s MBA program topped its list \u2014 shows that these top schools are simply consistently producing successfully entrepreneurial graduates of all genders.\n\n\u201cA lot of the undergraduates [at these schools] have been heavily focusing on computer science and engineering, especially in the past decade or so. It makes sense, since those schools are producing those types of degree holders, that both male and female graduates would be the ones creating these products and companies,\u201d said Andy White, a Pitchbook analyst.\n\nHowever, even the top schools on the Pitchbook list are seeing a large disparity between the number of female founders they graduate and the total number of company founders spawned by each school. For instance, Stanford may lead the way with 40 female founders over the past five years, but that group accounts for less than 11% of the total number (378) of Stanford alums to receive VC funding for their companies in that period. Similarly, female founders account for only about 16% of the 352 total company founders with Harvard MBAs from that same time period.\n\nWhite says he expects the gap between female and male company founders to narrow over time, though, and he even points to a Pitchbook study from last year showing that companies with at least one female founder have increased their share of VC funding rounds in each of the previous 10 years. Those numbers showed female-founded companies more than tripled their share of U.S. venture rounds during that time, rising to 13% last year.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot more money flowing into those companies founded by women and I can only see that increasing,\u201d White said.",

The works, a staggering 2,400 of them, were presented to us by half a dozen quite dazzling young men, all artists themselves.\n\nThe bonus of male beauty apart, much of the art was a joy and quite often two or three of us would be trying to bag the same picture. Mark mainly wanted what I wanted. It was quite comforting to find Peter Randall-Page and Norbert Lynton wanted the same as me. And I almost never wanted anything that Mark wanted. When Mark absented himself for a couple of hours to do an interview, I helpfully chose a photograph of a fish on a women's backside on his behalf. Sadly, he was having none of it when he returned. So the lady and the trout do not appear in his list.\n\nThe exhibition opens tomorrow at the Mall Galleries in London (020-7930 6844), and of the 500 works of art on display, my collection is the largest. I've made a selection of 90, mostly by young artists. I've got a couple of installation pieces that are fantastically eclectic, by really interesting young graduates. One of my favourites is a portrait of James Lloyd by Brendan Kelly. And I've discovered Matthew Webber, who is wonderful.\n\nTwo things struck me: first, what a vast amount of unsung talent there is out there; and second, to this trader's daughter, how sweetly uncommercial the youngsters were. \"Call it Notting Hill,\" I urged one of the young artists with an untitled work, \"it will walk out the door in seconds.\" I want to insist that anyone going to art college must attend a three-month marketing course, preferably taught by me. It is all about getting your work known, circulated and hung.",

This one is but a tiny sample.\"\n\nWhen King received the letter, he told friends that someone wanted him to kill himself, the Times reported.\n\nThe letter goes on to tell King: \"There is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is\" -- an apparent exhortation for him to kill himself.\n\nThe letter was crafted to make it appear it came from someone within the civil rights movement, making a reference to \"us Negroes\".\n\n\"You could not believe in God and act as you do,\" the letter states.\n\n\"Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.\"\n\nThe document provides a compelling illustration of how deeply paranoid the FBI had become under the stewardship of Hoover, whose name still adorns the federal police agency's Washington headquarters.\n\nHoover believed King was being influenced by communists, and King accused the FBI of failures in stopping violence against blacks in the segregated Deep South.\n\nIn 1963, King famously made his \"I Have a Dream\" speech in Washington during an enormous rally in the nation's capital.\n\nThe march helped set the stage for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlawed major forms of racial discrimination, followed a year later by the Voting Rights Act, designed to guarantee the franchise for all black US citizens.\n\nKing was gunned down by a sniper in 1968.\n\nDo you have any news photos or videos?",

        "text": "BY JOHN H. FENTON; SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMESJUNE 28, 1964\n\nBOSTON, June 27\u2014A Metho\u00addist minister from Boothbay Harbor, Me., has suggested that the John Birch Society may well be \u201con the road to respect\u00adability if its money holds out.\u201d\n\nThe minister is the Rev. Dr. J. Allen Broyles. He said, how\u00adever, that such \u201crespectability\u201d tvas \u201cstill quite a distance clown the street.\u201d In the meantime, he said, others might just as well learn to manage the prob\u00adlem of coexistence with the ul\u00adtra\u2010conservative organization.\n\nThe minister expressed his views in \u201cThe John Birch So\u00adciety; Anatomy of a Protest,\u201d ($4.50), recently published by the Beacon Press. It was a re\u00advision of a doctoral dissertation submitted to the department of sociology and social ethics of the Boston University Graduate School.\n\nIn defining respectability, Dr. Broyles said that Robert H. W. Welch Jr., the founder of the society, had always maintained that his members were made up of \u201creal, solid citizens.\u201d The minister did not interview Mr. Welch in compiling his mate\u00adrial.\n\n\u201cMost of the members I in\u00adterviewed were in the middle or upper\u2010middle class, but most of them were \u2018fringe\u2019 within their communities, due partly, of course, to their outlandish views which are part and par\u00adcel of the ideology of the socie\u00adty,\u201d said Dr. Broyles. \u201cTheir socio\u2010economic status qualified them for \u2018respectability,\u2019 but their politics did not.\u201d\n\nThe minister saw the soci\u00adty's executive council exerting a continuing moderating in\u00adfluence on Mr. Welch. He ex\u00adpected that this would lead to Mr. Welch's views and interests becoming \u201csomewhat more re\u00adstrained and conventional.\u201d\n\nThe Birch Society, Dr. Broy\u00adles contended, would begin a \u201crapid downward spiral\u201d if a\n\nAn Arizona member told the minister that he thought the conservative movement, of which the Birch Society was a part, \u201cis basically a protest by people over the loss of individ\u00aduality.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its purported mission of fighting Communists, the Birch Society also professes to fight \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\nAbout the time Dr. Broyles's book was being displayed in book stores, a report filed with the office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, Edward W. Brooke, showed the society had ended 1963 with a deficit of $210.952.\n\nThe report, required by law, showed gross income of $1,043,\u00ad656 and expenses of $1,169,997 in 1963. There also was a carry\u00adover deficit of $84,612 from 1962.\n\nThe membership of the Birch Society remains a secret. When he organized it, Mr. Welch set a goal of 1 million members. Some estimates have placed the mem\u00adbership at about 100,000 at the most.\n\nTwice in recent years, Mr. Welch has acknowledged that attacks on the society have slowed its growth. But he has vigorously disputed any sug\u00adgestion that the slowing rate indicated a substantial loss of membership.\n\nDr. Broyles found that the average distribution rate of American Opinion, the society's monthly magazine, was 27,000 copies.\n\nDr. Broyles said that most of the society members he in\u2010\n\nSince attempts to reform the society from the outside were \u201cfore\u2010doomed,\u201d Dr. Broyles said. that coexistence with such ex\u00adtremist groups had to be faced. In the process, responsible citi\u00adzens should not let inflamma\u00adtory charges by the extremists go unchallenged. he asserted.\n\nMembers of the Birch Society, saki Dr. Broyles, \u201cdo not spend all their time making accusa\u00adtions against uersons.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them touch upon real issues and problems in many areas of our national life,\u201d he declared, \u201cbut the most that could be said for the great majority of the members and leaders would be that where they are scratching there was an itch, but that their scratch\u00ading was only broadening the inflammation.\u201d\n\nDr. Broyles saidhe had talked with a member of the Birch staff in the Belmont na\u00adtional headquarters about two weeks after President Ken\u00adnedy's assassination. And while there had been no \u201cdropouts\u201d from the society as a result, Dr. Broyles said he found the atmosphere of the place more restrained.\n\nThe staff inembers, said Dr. Broyles, commented that it seemed \u201ca time when people need to speak the truth with prudence.\u201d\n\nCalling for a spirit of ra\u00adtionality, Dr. Broyles com\u00admented:\n\n\u201cIt is sobering to remind our\u00adselves and to remind even the Birchers that, if we do not de\u00adfend freedom and rationality as the norms of political conflict, we ought not to be surprised to find ourselves caught in a to\u00adtalitarianism not only from the left or from the right, but per\u00adhaps even from the center.\u201d\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form.

        "text": "PHOENIX -- When the Diamondbacks acquired shortstop Didi Gregorius, general manager Kevin Towers compared Gregorius' defense to that of \"a young Derek Jeter.\"\n\nIt might have been an undersell.\n\nD-backs bench coach and four-time Gold Glove winner Alan Trammell is not given to hyperbole, but he could not help but rave about Gregorius' scoop and throw from deep in the hole in the seventh inning of a 5-1 victory Friday.\n\nTo balance things, Gregorius used his bat to make a difference Saturday.\n\nHis three-run home run broke a 2-2 tie in the last of the eighth inning, giving the D-backs' a 5-2 victory over San Diego and assuring a series victory against a team they could catch for third place in the NL West.\n\nGregorius drove an 0-2 fastball into the front row of the right field seats to break a 2-for-39 slump.\n\nAs his fielding play Friday showed, Gregorius has no trouble separating his offense from his defense.\n\nAs his homer Saturday showed, his constant work in the batting cage can have its rewards.\n\nGregorius has been retooling his swing since spring training, and the process has included the expected stops and starts. At the same time, he has been an eager, attentive student. There were Gregorius and Jake Lamb, who hit his first major league homer Saturday, taking extra batting practice with hitting coach Turner Ward hours four hours before the game Saturday.\n\n\"I would say, about time,\" Gregorius said of his home run. \"I've been working, getting better, going down in the cage every day, just trying to make improvements. Luckily, I got one right there.\"\n\nHe has not let the dry spell bring him down.\n\n\"Just go at-bat by at-bat, don't worry about it. I can't change it. I don't really think about it. Just go out and play the game. Don't drag one at-bat to the next one,\" Gregorius said.\n\nHis perseverance has not gone unnoticed, so much so that the shortstop battle won by Chris Owings last spring is beginning to look like another open competition entering the 2015 season.\n\n\"He's worked very hard. He hasn't had instant gratification or instant results, and it is good to see that happened to him tonight,\" Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. \"He's made some changes and he hasn't been rewarded much, but tonight it came through for him.\"\n\nOne of Gregorius' major selling points is his glove, the part of his game that was evident when he was promoted to the D-backs early last season after a hand injury sidelined second baseman Aaron Hill for 10 weeks. It is one of the reasons the Yankees, among many others, have had scouts watching him this season as Jeter finishes up.\n\nGregorius is most proud of the diving, full-extension stop and throw from his backside to start a double play against Tampa Bay here last season, and those who saw that still smile when they remember it.\n\n\"Everybody in the bullpen jumped out of their chairs, screaming and going nuts. It was unbelievable,\" D-backs reliever Brad Ziegler said.\n\nThe play Friday was similar. Gregorius went far into the hole at shortstop, almost behind third baseman Lamb, to field a sharp grounder by Jedd Gyorko. Gregorius gloved the ball and in one motion, without stopping or planting his feet, whipped a throw to that hit first baseman Mark Trumbo's glove chest-high.\n\n\"I was astonished,\" Trumbo said.\n\nWhen looking at the 6-foot-2, 205-pound Gregorius, Trammell sees the evolution of the position.\n\n\"These guys, including Didi, it's a different breed now,\" said Trammell, who won who Gold Gloves in Detroit in 1980-81 and 1983-84.\n\n\"They're better. They're more athletic. The plays on the run that we are seeing like Didi's, that's definitely one of the best plays I've ever seen, especially with the amount of velocity (on the throw). It wasn't a balloon over there. He is going full speed the opposite direction, not stopping, throwing the ball on the run, on a line. It was an incredible play.\n\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen one better.\"\n\nWhen Gregorius was a teenager at a tryout camp in the Dominican Republic, his velocity was registered at 94-95 mph on a throw from right field to third base.\n\nWhen he saw the throw heading right at Trumbo's mitt Friday, he just kept running toward the D-backs' dugout. When he got to the dugout, his teammates made jokes.\n\n\"The guys say funny things. Yesterday they told me at least make it look a little bit harder,\" Gregorius said.\n\nIt has been that kind of weekend.\n\nThe D-backs dugout gave rookie Jake Lamb a 45-second silent treatment following his first major league home run in the second inning. Lamb played along with it nicely, putting up some air high-fives as he entered the dugout and made his way to a seat at the far end of the bench.\n\n\"I went in there and saw nobody was around,\" Lamb said. \"I like to have fun. I started giving high fives to nobody.\"\n\nA short while later, everyone on the bench crowded around him to celebrate.\n\n99 -- Career saves by Addison Reed\n\n*Again, Vidal Nuno deserved better. He allowed five players to reach base in 7 1/3 innings -- two singles, two walks and a hit batsman -- but was left with a no-decision when two of his inherited runners scored in the top of the eighth inning to tie the game at 2. Despite a 3.54 ERA, he is 0-3 and winless in nine D-backs' starts, extending a franchise record for starters. \"It's part of the game. I just try to go deep in ball games. I've just been unlucky,\" Nuno said. \"I'll keep on fighting, and one day I'll get it.\"\n\n*Chris Owings started at second in his rehab game at Triple-A Reno on Saturday and will see occasional time at second base when he returns to the major leagues in a week or so, manager Kirk Gibson said. \"I just have a curiosity,\" Gibson said. \"I know he can play short. We have some games left here in the last month. Why not put him over there at second as well? We played him over there in spring training as well. You're looking ahead at who might be where (in 2015). It is a possibility.\" Owings, Gregorius, Aaron Hill, Cliff Pennington and minor leaguer Nick Ahmed give the D-backs deep depth in the middle infield, furthering the notion that an offseason trade with come from there.\n\n*Addison Reed pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his 30th save and is on a good run. He has converted his last 10 save attempts, tying a career high set with the Chicago White Sox from Aug. 6-27, 2013.\n\nThe D-backs seem more and more likely to go to a six-man rotation in September, and Randall Delgado could make some starts down the stretch, Gibson said. Delgado has made progress on his third pitch, a breaking ball, and has shown flashes. \"If you gave him a chance to start, would it help him be able to work his way through and have more consistency?\" Gibson said. \"That question hasn't been answered yet. but those are things we think about.\"\n\nFollow Jack Magruder on Twitter",

Within a couple of months, they'd decided to see each other exclusively.\n\nBut the relationship was not without its drama. In September of 2012, following a Routh family gathering during which the former Marine threatened to kill himself and others, Weed got a voicemail from him late that night. He had been admitted to Green Oaks, a psychiatric hospital in Dallas.\n\n\"He was upset and tearful,\" she testified, recalling the next time she saw him after he'd been transferred to the Veterans Administration hospital. \"He asked if he could come stay with me at my apartment.\" Weed agreed.\n\nRouth also had another question. Weed recalls that he asked her to marry him, but she turned him down at the time: \"I told him not until he was allowed to have shoelaces.\"\n\nThe couple began living together at Weed's apartment, but after less than a month, \"we'd begun to get on each other's nerves,\" she said, adding that they took a break from the relationship until late November.\n\nJanuary of 2013 proved to be a volatile month for the couple. Weed testified about several incidents in which she was called by Routh or a family member, asking her to come help him. On one occasion, she arrived at his house to find him \"sitting on the couch, just staring at the wall for several hours.\"\n\nAnother time, he called and asked her to pick him up from his house. When she got there, he ran toward the car with his dog Girlie in tow.\n\n\"He jumped in the car, screaming, 'Go, go, go!' \" she recalled.\n\nOn another night at her apartment, \"he started calling me names, accusing me of drug usage and that I was trying to steal his soul. He kept insisting that I take him back to Lancaster because he was gonna die that night and wanted to say goodbye to his mom.\"\n\nThe following morning, on Jan. 19, Routh, Weed and her roommate were all at the apartment. The couple had made plans to visit his attorney about a DUI charge, but as they approached the front door, he grabbed one of their decorative ninja swords and said, \"We're not going anywhere.\"\n\n\"He thought people were out to get us and we had to stay in the apartment, because the apartment was safe,\" Weed said, adding later that she didn't feel threatened.\n\nRouth then traded the ninja sword for a large knife he pulled from a butcher's block in the kitchen. Weed texted her roommate that \"Eddie's in a mood,\" and that she shouldn't leave her room.\n\nEventually, police arrived and the roommate escaped by running out through the back patio door and jumping over a fence. Routh was again taken to Green Oaks and transferred to the VA hospital. He was released six days later.\n\nThe week following his release was full of arguments between the couple, mostly about his marijuana habit and tobacco use. On the night of Feb. 1, following a fight, \"he got a legal pad out and started writing things down,\" she says. \"I tried to speak, but he covered my mouth because he said he didn't want them to hear what I was saying.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jane Starnes noted that one of the things he'd written on the legal pad was \"that y'all should make pot cupcakes to make a lot of money.\"\n\n\"Do you want to have a career making pot cupcakes?\" she asked Weed.\n\n\"No,\" she replied, adding that she also didn't want to go into the goat lawn-care business or have a bunny rabbit farm, both of which had been brought up by Routh in the past.\n\nBefore they went to bed that night, Weed asked if he'd taken his medication that day. He said he hadn't, and that he also hadn't eaten anything.\n\n\"We were in the kitchen and I was getting his medication for him,\" she said. \"I turned back around to see him on his knees, and he asked me to marry him. I said yes, and he got up and wrapped his arms around my stomach and started crying.\n\n\"We ate some of Jodi's spiced crackers and we went to bed,\" she added.\n\nThe next morning, the two had another bad argument, this time over chewing tobacco that Eddie was using. She texted Routh's uncle, James Watson, saying, \"You'd better get here quick. I'm about to kill your nephew.\"\n\nWhen Watson arrived, Routh kicked Weed out of the house.\n\n\"He was washing dishes and he did have a knife when he told me to leave,\" she confirmed to Starnes.\n\nHours later, Chris Kyle would arrive at the house, walk up the gravel driveway and say, \"You must be Eddie.\" According to testimony from Routh's mother, Kyle was in the dark about any specifics of Routh's recent behavior.\n\nKyle, Littlefield and Routh left for the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range in Kyle's black pickup truck. That afternoon, Routh showed up at his sister's house in the truck, alone.\n\n\"Hey, what's up,\" Routh said to his sister and her husband, Gaines Blevins. The three sat at the dining room table, \"and he said he'd killed two guys,\" Blevins recalled. \"I didn't believe him, because he's said crazy stuff before.\"\n\nBut then Routh went into more detail: He mentioned Kyle by name. He said they'd gone to a gun range. He told them he sold his soul for a pickup truck.\n\n\"I said, 'If this is true, you've got to turn yourself in,' \" Blevins testified. \"You can't just go around killing people.\"\n\nShe then said she was calling the police. As they walked toward the front door, Blevins got her first look at what he was driving.\n\n\"I felt like I was about to throw up,\" she said, \"because this could be a real possibility.\"\n\nThat afternoon, \"the person who came in that house was not who I knew as my brother,\" she told the court. After she told him she loved him but hated his demons, \"for a moment, he was my little baby brother. I could tell he needed me. But it switched back so quickly.\"\n\nThe trial continued on Thursday, as the defense makes its case for the jury to find Routh\n\n. The prosecution rested on Tuesday.",

No, it\u2019s not Richard Linklater\u2019s celebrated \u201cBefore\u201d project, with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy living out the long arc of a relationship, but the much less heralded \u201cHenry Fool\u201d trilogy from Hal Hartley. A major indie auteur in the 1990s, Hartley has been nigh invisible the past decade, but he has kept plugging away in his signature style: attractively mordant characters delivering deadpan seriocomic monologues about philosophy and romance.\n\nWith \u201cNed Rifle,\u201d Hartley brings to a close the family saga begun in his biggest hit, \u201cHenry Fool\u201d (1997), and continued in the fairly bewildering \u201cFay Grim\u201d (2006). The new film is a return to form after that sagging midsection, and the coterie of Hartley admirers still paying attention will find frustrations, rewards, a few darkly intelligent laughs, and an ending that unexpectedly haunts.\n\nAdded bonus: more stuff for Aubrey Plaza to do. As the latest recruit to Hartley-land, the \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d star seems born to the mannerisms, and her way with a fetching glower fits right in. When \u201cNed Rifle\u201d opens, Fay Grim (Parker Posey) is still serving a life sentence on a framed-up terrorism charge (don\u2019t ask), and her 18-year-old son, Ned (Liam Aiken), has emerged from witness protection with a profound belief in God and a burning anger toward Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), the reprobate father he never met. Bidding farewell to his Reverend foster father (Hartley regular Martin Donovan), Ned packs a Bible and a gun and sets out to make amends.\n\nFirst, he has to visit his Uncle Simon (James Urbaniak), the onetime garbage man turned prize-winning poet-reclusive literary legend of \u201cHenry Fool.\u201d Fame is wearing on Simon, who has started a stand-up comedy video blog out of boredom; it\u2019s pretty terrible. Pointing his nephew in the direction of Seattle, he also inadvertently throws Ned together with Susan (Plaza), a possibly unhinged graduate student-stalker whose secrets involving the other characters take most of the movie to surface.\n\nFor all that, you probably don\u2019t need to have seen the first two movies to get on this one\u2019s offbeat road-movie wavelength. Aiken, who was 7 when \u201cHenry Fool\u201d was made, has aged into a lean, charismatic center of stillness, and you want to see Ned come out all right if only to make good on the actor\u2019s two-decade investment. He and Plaza make an arresting team, the child of God and the damaged sexpot, and it\u2019s fascinating (if a little bizarre) to see the actress push her gloomy persona into more erotic territory. \u201cNed Rifle\u201d isn\u2019t Plaza\u2019s break-out role \u2014 that was \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d in 2012 \u2014 but it does indicate that she\u2019s more than the Millennial Eeyore ing\u00e9nue she can be typed as.\n\nThe movie gets a real lift when Ned and Susan finally track down Henry Fool, who\u2019s being held against his will in a pharmacological mental institution after drug experiments have convinced him he\u2019s Satan. (This qualifies as a normal development in a Hal Hartley movie.) As before, Ryan breaks through the glass wall of the film\u2019s style with energetic cynicism; Henry is a Bukowski bad boy whose acid brilliance shines only in person, never on paper.\n\nPosey is in only a handful of scenes, which is fine: Stiff and unconvincing, she seems to have lost interest in her character. Can you blame her? I\u2019m not sure what Hartley\u2019s larger game plan is, other than to explore the way sins ricochet and deepen through a family over the years. The tension in his movies comes from the collision of hot emotions and cool behavior; the filmmaking is deadpan, too, as though Jim Jarmusch had gotten stranded in Middle America.\n\nBut Hartley lacks Jarmusch\u2019s visual invention, not to mention his interest in a world outside his characters. At its worst, \u201cNed Rifle\u201d is a self-involved movie about self-involved people. When it clicks, though, we\u2019re in a pared-down moral universe that carries unsettling echoes of our own.",

        "text": "LEVERETT \u2014 When people think of the Massachusetts tech economy, they probably don\u2019t think of this town of 1,900 built into the woods about 10 miles north of Amherst.\n\nSince April, this Western Massachusetts community has steadily connected homes, businesses, and town offices to a municipal fiber-optic network offering broadband services that have long bypassed this part of the state.\n\nToday, software developer Al Nutile can video-conference and write code simultaneously with a project team scattered across three continents from his hillside home.\n\nCarter Wall, who lives on a dirt road, can download big data files from the solar power installations she monitors. At the local cafe, people can bring iPads and get blazing-fast Wi-Fi instead of waiting their turn to surf the net at a dusty, old desktop with a satellite connection that cuts out in bad weather.\n\nBy the end of this month, Leverett will have linked every home in town to broadband. Nearby communities are not far behind in bringing broadband to their residents; they see high-speed Internet as an economic boon akin to rural electrification in the 1930s, one that could bring higher home values, better business climates, and easier access to the modern economy.\n\nThese new connections are the culmination of an eight-year, $90 million effort by the state to build a \u201cbackbone\u201d of fiber-optic data transmission lines across Western Massachusetts.\n\nThe network, financed with state and federal stimulus money, will extend broadband to 45 isolated towns where 40 percent of homes have no Internet access and the rest are relegated to dial-up, DSL, and satellite connections operating at a fraction of speeds available in Eastern Massachusetts.\n\nState and federal economic development officials view access to high-speed Internet as a way to boost rural economies, where traditional industries such as farming, forestry, and paper making have declined, and connect them to 21st-century services, such as online education and telemedicine.\n\nWith private telecommunication companies unable to profitably extend their networks to sparsely populated areas, state, federal, and local governments have stepped in.\n\nIn Leverett, for example, voters in 2012 approved borrowing $3.6 million \u2014 nearly $1,900 per resident \u2014 for the town to lay fiber lines to 800 premises and connect to the main trunk built by the state.\n\n\u201cMore and more communities understand that high-speed wired Internet access represents critical infrastructure right up there with telephone and roads,\u201d said David Talbot, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. \u201cCommunity networks are often seen as a way to advance economic development, attract high-tech businesses, cut municipal costs, and bring competition to the market.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Broadband Institute, a quasi-public agency overseeing the Western Massachusetts project, estimates that completing the so-called last mile of fiber that connects end users will cost an additional $112 million. About $50 million will be funded by the state, and the rest from local funds.\n\nAbout 32 towns have banded together in a group called Wired West, which is working with the broadband institute to build and operate fiber lines to individual buildings.\n\nIn recent months, about 19 of Wired West\u2019s towns have approved borrowing a total of $30 million, according to Monica Webb, chairwoman of the collaborative. About five more will vote in few months, she said. All the local funding must be approved by June 2016 to qualify for state money.\n\nBefore construction starts in each town, 40 percent of its residents must sign up for service, which starts at $49 a month for speeds similar to Comcast\u2019s basic offering in Boston and rises to $109 for a version that is 40 times faster.\n\nWhen the fiber networks are completed in the next two to five years, the towns will own them and Wired West, a municipally owned entity, will operate them.\n\nLeverett has contracted a private company to provide Internet service, which will cost subscribers $65 a month. That\u2019s about same as Comcast and Verizon FIOS customers pay in Greater Boston, but the speeds in Leverett are about 10 times faster.\n\nResidents already are witnessing the economic potential of broadband.\n\nNow that her Leverett home is hooked up to the fiber network, Wall has sold her house in Medford, where she lived half the time because her job as a solar energy consultant often required higher speeds than she could get in Leverett.\n\nShe\u2019s taking the $170,000 gain she made from the sale and splitting it between her retirement fund and a nonprofit she recently cofounded, the Future Face of American Energy, which will match women and people of color with internships in the energy industry.\n\nIn New Marlborough, a Wired West town, filmmaker Douglas Trumbull has already hooked up to the fiber backbone, paying the cost of laying fiber from his studio.\n\nTrumbull is developing a high-resolution, high-frame-rate-viewing technology called Magi, which has required him to build his own server farm to process the images and send hard drives in the mail to studios and other clients because Internet connections were too slow.\n\nHe now expects to cut his costs by using cloud computing services to produce and share video.\n\nGerald Jones, the owner of Jones Group Realtors in Amherst, sells houses in the communities targeted by the state\u2019s broadband initiative.\n\nHe said he has given financial support to the broadband committee in Shutesbury and his agents have advised clients in Shutesbury and elsewhere to vote in support of building the networks.\n\nHe said a growing number of homebuyers refuse to consider properties that can\u2019t get high-speed Internet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten more and more important as time has gone on,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you had a town with no school system and you were trying to sell a house to someone with kids.\u201d\n\nThe completion of the broadband \u201cbackbone\u201d may also spur private investment.\n\nAdam Chait, the owner of a small Internet service provider in Monterey, in the southwest corner of the state, said he is raising money to build a network connecting 1,000 homes in Berkshire County as a test to show that private companies can profitably serve remote areas.\n\nHe declined to estimate how much he\u2019ll need.\n\nLocal officials admit the work of building broadband networks has been complicated, and some benefits, such as new businesses, could take years to appear.\n\nLeverett has created Web pages and information packets to help educate residents about key parts of their new system.\n\nEric Nakajima, the head of the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, said his group\u2019s priority is making sure that towns\u2019 broadband systems were well-maintained and won\u2019t run out of money.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely early days,\u201d Nakajima said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a test case right now in the region or in the state where we can look and say, \u2018Let\u2019s evaluate.\u2019 \u201d",

Students in hoodies and headphones wearing thick, rectangle-rimmed glasses discuss \u2018critical thinking\u2019 and on sunny days sit crossed-legged on the grass by a lake as construction dust blows in the wind.\n\nBut some of these students have never liked a Facebook message or sent a friend request. They send tweets on Weibo not Twitter and upload photos on Weixin not Instagram.\n\nWelcome to Ningbo in China, Northern Zhenjiang province, five thousand miles away from the UK.\n\nEvery international business in the world, from textiles to technology, is trying to access the Chinese market. The education business is no different.\n\nNingbo is famous for its entrepreneurs and foreign investment. For the last 10 years it has also been home to Nottingham Ningbo (UNNC) a satellite campus of Nottingham University.\n\nThe campus is a partnership between the University of Nottingham UK and the Wanli Education group, a Chinese state-owned company. Staffed with both Chinese and international academics, it is sold as a genuine UK university experience in China.\n\nThis new fleet of universities is part of China\u2019s big ambition to become a world powerhouse for education \u2013 for students from San Francisco to Shanghai.\n\nForeign institutions are falling over themselves to set up partnerships with Chinese universities - from cooperation projects to creating campuses that mirror their own in Chinese cities. For international universities this provides an opportunity to get a foothold in a country already obsessed with education. And more importantly for the students, for future business leaders in particular, it offers an insight into a marketplace that still proves elusive for international companies.\n\n\"I think being immersed in the country changes your sense of the reality of it, \u201csaid Joseph Healey, a Scottish banker in his early 50s who took a masters degree at UNNC after serving as a senior executive at the National Australia Bank. \u201cI spent over 10 years discussing China with leaders in business [outside of China] and a big part of the problem is that we have a shallow understanding of the complexity of this country. So it is no surprise that so many businesses have failed.\u201d\n\nNew York University, John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and Liverpool University, among others, have all set up campuses in China.\n\nMeanwhile the Chinese government is pouring money in to transforming its education sector: in the last decade alone it quadrupled its number of annual university graduates. The country has also become the world's largest exporter of students, with nearly as many Chinese students studying for postgraduate degrees in England as there are Brits.\n\nIt now ranks 3rd in the world's most popular places for international study, behind only the UK and America, and is expected to attract more than half a million international students by 2020 studying degrees and study abroad programmes, according to the US-based Institute of International Education\u2019s Project Atlas.\n\nBut this huge expansion is not without its problems: there have been concerns over academic integrity at some institutions. In July 2012 Yale cancelled its programme at Peking University. The American Ivy League university allegedly blamed its decision on lower than expected interest in its courses. But its programme also faced controversy. In 2007 a biology professor openly criticised administrators for tolerating alleged widespread plagiarism amongst Chinese students.\n\nInternational campuses like UNNC face a unique set of difficulties. Administrators must try to ensure a high standard of education and academic freedom in a country where politics can interfere in everything. In January, China's education minister vowed to ban university text books that promote 'Western values\u2019, sparking widespread concern in Western educational circles.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Education has promised to provide foreign universities with the same freedoms they enjoy in their home countries. But the institutions must also comply with Chinese rules and regulations which means studying of Marxism is compulsory for Chinese students, for example, but not for international students.\n\nAnd China's strict control of the internet also means that some foreign-based websites such as Google Scholar, a search engine which indexes scholarly literature across formats and topics, is blocked in the country. Researchers must use virtual private networks (VPN) in order to use such services.\n\nThere are other practical difficulties. While seminars are taught in English, many international students find themselves in classes where the majority of their classmates are not native English speakers. And this can create some significant obstacles.\n\n\u201cMostly, Chinese students in class don't participate. Back home when you know you are right you tell the lecturer,\u201d said Ella Appiah a 20-year-old student from Ghana studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree in International Communications at UNNC.\n\nThat might be more a product of cultural norms than any language barriers, said Amir Emamizadeh, a 19-year-old British student at UNNC. \u201cChinese students struggle in group activities as they don't have experience in that at high school,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough to be sure for many of the students the advantages of being immersed in China far outweigh any of the difficulties. Students point out that being part of a rapidly changing society has significant advantages for their studies, in particular case work.\n\n\"As a global health student I feel that I have the advantage of studying in a country that gives me a first-hand experience in global health challenges in the 21st century. We have the chance to have field visits to different parts of China where we experience first-hand important health issues,\" said Kennedy Opondo, a 26-year-old Kenyan studying at the school.\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

Amazing, eh?\n\nBut the average after-market return (after the first day) has been a DECLINE of 11.3 percent.\n\nTake Castlight Health (CSLT),which went public on March 13. It provides software that helps self-insured employers control healthcare costs. The original price talk was $9-$11, it priced at $16, and the first day closed over $40, up 148 percent. Wow!\n\nIt is now at $13.80, 13 percent below its IPO price.\n\nHuh? The stock is UP 148 percent on its first day, and is now 13 percent below its IPO price?\n\nTake a look at the prices of a few other tech or tech-like companies after their first day of trading:\n\nWhat happened? Two things happened: 1) the overall market uptrend broke in the beginning of April, and 2) the appetite for high-risk/high-growth waned.\n\nIn the case of Castlight, this was one of those cloud companies with no earnings, a subscription model.\n\nHere's another example: Varonis (VRNS), which provides software that manages data security and other data, went public February 27 at $22. It closed over $40 on the first day, up 100 percent.\n\nOK, you say, it's still above its initial price. But, I ask you: if you were an average investor who bought this stock for $40 on the first day, how would you feel about buying more IPOs after seeing this one trading at $26 six weeks later?\n\nAt least there's no tech IPOs coming next week. There's Papa Murphy's (FRSH), a pizza company, but the biggest deal is Ares Asset Management (ARES), an \"alternative\" asset management company. The word \"alternative\" is a phrase meaning \"anything but stocks.\"\n\nSo what's next? Oddly, nothing has jumped on to the calendar recently. The deal calendar is very low. There is silence.\n\nThat's a sign the market is under stress.\n\nHere's how it works: A company announces it has filed to go public. Right now, there are 118 IPOs that have filed to go public, trying to raise $25 billion, according to Renaissance.\n\nThey include companies like Box, Synchrony Financial (consumer lending arm of GE), and JD.com (Chinese online sales platform).\n\nAnd that's just those that are public; there are probably 100 that are in \"confidential\" filings with the SEC that have not been publicly announced yet.\n\nBut there's a big gap between ANNOUNCING you are going public and GOING public.\n\nSome time after announcing it's going public, the company will set terms by announcing a price range for the IPO, then will begin a road show. It tells you it is actively marketing. Then it goes public.\n\nThe time between setting terms and going public is usually about two weeks.\n\nBut suddenly, we don't hear anything from the hot space: Technology.\n\nNot a single tech company has filed for terms since Sabre (SABR) last week.\n\nThat means no tech companies are beginning road shows. Why not? Because they are afraid.\n\nOf course, IPO issuers are still talking up the business. They say, \"Look how many IPOs have been done, you can go too!\"\n\nBut that's a bad way to look at it. When you price below the price talk, or the low end of the price talk, that's a disappointment.\n\nWhen you have the kind of declines we have seen from the first day pops, that's a disappointment.\n\nThis is a good turn of events. We did have froth. This is now taking froth out.\n\nIt will set up for the next round. Some companies may not make it, but most will go public. But they will come at lower prices. Good for investors.\n\nWhat needs to happen? First, we need the stock market to stabilize. Then, we need more stability in the IPO market.\n\nWatch the Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of over 60 IPOs, which is now down 2.8 percent this year, versus a decline of 0.7 percent for the S&P 500. It's down 12 percent since hitting its high in early March. That's where to look for stability.\n\nAnd watch to see if any tech companies announce price terms next week and begin a road show. If we hear nothing\u2014silence\u2014that will be the biggest indicator of all the IPO boom has withered. For the moment.",

I started that when I was 16; we stopped playing a few years ago. It was me and Mikal Cronin . . . we played up until I was 23 or something. We did a couple tours with Ty [Segall] before we joined the band; it was just part of the collective.\n\nTy Segall Band: I played in Ty\u2019s band for five years \u2014 it was just that we\u2019d all been doing it for a while, so it was time to switch things up. It was amazing; I love everyone in that group.\n\nFuzz: I know there are garage elements to what we do, but we definitely don\u2019t identify as a garage band. It\u2019s different than Ty\u2019s music; this is a band where we write together, we constantly try to keep things different. The band started because one day I was home and bored, and was sitting there wondering if I could record a song or just a couple riffs that sound like Black Sabbath. So I tried it, and it was really fun. I recorded it and brought it to Ty and I said, I\u2019ve got these ideas, I don\u2019t know how you feel about them. He thought they were rad, so we played them together. We were going at something with a specific direction.\n\nTOAD: There is a band called TOAD \u2014 me, Ty, and Mikal Cronin \u2014 that is some ridiculous punk [expletive] I can\u2019t even explain.

        "text": "It begins with a photograph. In 1934 a struggling Hungarian photographer, Andr\u00e9 Friedmann, living in exile in Paris, is commissioned to take publicity pictures for a Swiss life insurance company's advertising brochure. On the lookout for potential models, he approaches a young Swiss refugee, Ruth Cerf, in a caf\u00e9 on the Left Bank and convinces her to pose for him in a Montparnasse park.\n\nBecause she does not entirely trust the scruffy young charmer, Ruth brings along her friend Gerta Pohorylle, a petite redhead with a winning smile and a confident manner. So begins the most iconic relationship in the history of photography, and an intertwined and complex story of radical politics, bohemianism and bravery that, in the intervening years, has taken on the shadings of a modern myth.\n\nTogether, Andr\u00e9 Friedmann and Gerta Pohorylle would change their names and their destiny, becoming Robert Capa and Gerda Taro, the most celebrated visual chroniclers of the Spanish civil war. Together, too, they would change the nature of war photography, reinventing the form in a way that resonates to this day. Capa went on to become the most famous of the two, and arguably the most famous war photographer of the 20th century due to his visceral images of the D-day landings on Omaha Beach in Normandy. His most famous quote would become a dictum by which ensuing generations of war photographers worked: \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\"\n\nThis brave, but cavalier, approach to getting pictures of the action from within the action would cost both Gerda Taro and Robert Capa their lives \u2013 the former killed on the frontline of the Spanish civil war in 1937; the latter blown up by a land mine in Indochina in 1954. The myth of Robert Capa and Gerda Taro continues apace today with the British publication of a novel called Waiting for Robert Capa by Susana Fortes, a Spanish novelist and teacher. The book won the coveted Premio Fernando Lara in Spain on its initial publication in 2009 and has since been translated into 20 languages; the film rights have been bought by Michael Mann, the award-winning director of Heat (1995), The Insider (1999) and Public Enemies (2009). Fortes's short novel is essentially a historical romance that concentrates on the relationship between Capa and Taro. While the historical settings are accurate, Fortes literally puts words into each of their mouths, imagining conversations, thoughts and debates as well as accentuating both the doomed romance and the reckless bohemianism of the times.\n\nWith the Spanish civil war as its main backdrop, the narrative is an uneasy, sometimes awkward, merging of fact and fiction, and will almost certainly offend the many guardians of both Capa and Taro's reputations just as it will no doubt entrance the mainstream cinema-going audience should it be made into a Hollywood film. \"I tried to be very respectful of the facts \u2013 the biographical data, the locations etc,\" says Fortes when I contact her in Spain, where she is on a book publicity tour. \"I went through everything I could find: letters, memories, biographies\u2026 But for a novel to breathe, you have to build souls for your characters. This is reflected in the dialogue, the literary tension, the humour, the fights, the passion, the sex, the mixed feelings. In other words, life. That's part of the novelist's job. One always writes with one foot on the ground and the other in the air. It is the only way to walk the path.\"\n\nHowever, when I mention the book to Jimmy Fox \u2013 veteran photographic historian and erstwhile director of the famous Magnum agency, which Capa co-founded with Henri Cartier-Bresson \u2013 he says: \"I was dismayed by the novel. It was so fluttery and sugary. I think it is wrong to elevate the romance in that way. Capa was a flamboyant guy, a great drinker and a womaniser who had so many lovers, including Ingrid Bergman. Taro found the love of her life in Ted Allan, the man who was with her when she was fatally wounded. But of course that does not fit the big simplified romantic version so neatly.\"\n\nThe independent filmmaker Trisha Ziff, who directed The Mexican Suitcase (2010) about the discovery of a hoard of unseen negatives by Capa, Taro and David \"Chim\" Seymour, concurs. \"Waiting for Robert Capa is a fiction based on a romance, but it is also a romance based on a fiction. If it becomes a Hollywood film, the myth will no doubt take over.\"\n\nIf there is one thing all the experts agree on, it is that nothing was straightforward about Robert Capa and Gerda Taro's relationship. Shortly after their first meeting, the young Andr\u00e9 Friedmann was sent to Spain on an assignment for a Berlin-based photo magazine. He subsequently photographed the Holy Week procession in Seville and described the festivities to Gerta Pohorylle in a letter that also mentioned how much he was thinking about her. On his return, he spent the summer holidaying in the south of France with Gerta and her friends. According to Ruth Cerf, quoted in Alex Kershaw's book Blood and Champagne: The Life and Times of Robert Capa, the pair \"fell in love in the south of France\" despite her suspicion that he was \"a rogue and a womaniser\". If the young Gerta was fascinated by his waywardness, he in turn was taken by her independent spirit. \"Here was a woman,\" writes Kershaw, \"who didn't suffocate him with affection, and who was as unashamed by her sexuality as she was conscious of her outsider status in Paris as a German Jew.\" This gets to the heart of the couple's mutual attraction: their shared radicalism and acute sense of exile. Friedmann had departed his native Hungary for Berlin in 1931 soon after his arrest by the secret police for leftist student activism. In February 1933, aged 19, he had fled Berlin when Hitler assumed power, travelling to Vienna, then back home to Budapest, before departing Hungary for good in September to live in penury in Paris, where he met Pohorylle on that fateful day in 1934.\n\nBy then, she too had experienced radical politics, arrest and flight. Born to bourgeois parents in Stuttgart in 1910, Pohorylle joined a young communist organisation and, around the time Friedmann was fleeing Berlin, was distributing anti-Nazi leaflets and putting up communist propaganda posters on walls under cover of darkness. She was arrested by the Nazis on 19 March 1933 and interrogated about a supposed Bolshevik plot to overthrow Hitler.\n\nOn her release, she used a fake passport to travel overland to Paris, where she was looked after by a communist network. Both Andr\u00e9 Friedmann and Gerta Pohorylle, though still young, were already seasoned activists and exiles when they met, intent on forging new lives for themselves while also staying loyal to their radical leftist roots.\n\nThough Friedmann could seldom afford to buy film and often had to pawn his camera to survive in Paris, he schooled Pohorylle in the rudiments of photography and found her a job in the newly formed Alliance Photo picture agency. And she, it seemed, anchored him \u2013 at least for a while. \"Without Gerta, Andr\u00e9 would not have made it,\" the late Eva Besny\u00f6, another Hungarian photographer who mixed in the same bohemian circles in Berlin, told Kershaw. \"She picked him up, gave him direction. He had never wanted an ordinary life, and so when things didn't go well, he drank and gambled. He was in a bad way when they met, and maybe without her it would have been the end for him.\"\n\nAs Friedmann's photographic career tentatively took off in Paris, his younger brother Cornell joined him, developing the photographs taken by Andr\u00e9 as well as those of his friends, Henri Cartier-Bresson and David \"Chim\" Seymour, in a darkened bathroom in a hotel that overlooked the famous Caf\u00e9 du D\u00f4me. It was there that the three photographers mingled with philosophers, writers and artists, drinking and dreaming of better times. It was around this time also that Andr\u00e9 Friedmann and Gerta Pohorylle became Robert Capa and Gerda Taro in a shared act of self-reinvention that still seems daring today.\n\nThe first anyone else heard of Robert Capa was when the couple turned up at the offices of Alliance Photo and announced they had discovered a famous American photographer of that name. The pair soon found they could sell photographs attributed to the fictitious Capa to French photographic agencies for three times the price of Friedmann's, such was the status accorded visiting American photographers. Their joint ruse was soon discovered, but the pseudonyms remained in place. In her essay for the exhibition catalogue Gerda Taro: Archive, published in 2007, Irme Schaber notes: \"Taro and Capa were not merely reacting to their precarious economic situation. They were responding as well to the antisemitism of Germany and the increasing antipathy towards foreigners in France. And to elude the stigma attached to being refugees, they spurned every ethnic or religious label.\"\n\nIf their joint self-reinvention was the first significant factor in the dramatic trajectory of Robert Capa and Gerda Taro, the second was their decision to go together to Spain in 1936 to cover the republican resistance to Franco's fascist rebels. Like many writers and artists, including George Orwell and Andr\u00e9 Malraux, they went there out of political conviction and scorned any notion of journalistic detachment. The fight against fascism was, in a very real and personal way, their fight, given their history as exiles and refugees, and the Spanish civil war was the literal and metaphorical frontline of that battle.\n\nIt was an adventure, though, that almost ended as soon as it had begun, when the plane hired by the French magazine Vu to take them to Barcelona crash-landed in a field on the outskirts of the city. The pair limped into Barcelona to find scenes of ferment and disorder as anarchist forces took over the city. There, they photographed young republicans leaving Barcelona for the frontlines. Then in September they travelled together to the front themselves, arriving in the village of Cerro Muriano near C\u00f3rdoba, where they found, and photographed, crowds of villagers fleeing their homes as the fascists rained shells down on the village. In one famous series of pictures, Capa captured Taro crouched, camera in hand, behind a wall beside a republican soldier. In another even more famous picture, perhaps the most well-known war photograph ever, Capa caught a militiaman at the very moment of his death from a sniper's bullet.\n\nIn that split second, the legend of Robert Capa, war photographer, was born, and decades later that same image would become the centre of a debate that still simmers over the ethics and veracity of war photography. In Waiting for Robert Capa, Fortes writes: \"Death of a Loyalist Militiaman contained all the drama of Goya's Third of May 1808 painting, all the rage that Guernica would later show\u2026 Its strength, like all symbols, didn't lie in just the image, but in what it was representing.\" Fortes also imagines Taro gently probing Capa for the story of what really happened that day, and him replying: \"We were just fooling around, that's all. Perhaps I complained that everything was far too calm and that there wasn't anything interesting to photograph. Then some of the men started to run down the slope and I joined in as well. We went up and down the hill several times. We were all feeling good. Laughing. They shot in the air. I took several photographs\u2026\"\n\nThough the context of the photograph is still contested, the imagined conversation does describe what probably happened that day just before a Francoist sniper returned fire from across the hills, killing the militiaman who was running down the hill for Capa's camera. \"People want the truth from war photography more than they do from any other kind of photography,\" says Jimmy Fox, the Magnum picture editor who has worked with the likes of Don McCullin and Philip Jones Griffiths, \"but a flat surface of an image is not the reality and never can be.\"\n\nIn Spain, Capa soon developed a reputation for taking photographs whatever the risk, setting the tone for war reportage as we now know it. Taro, too, was often seen running across the battle lines with her camera, her bravery matched by her recklessness. She travelled back and forth to the frontlines, shooting what she saw, often driven by a mixture of humanity, political commitment and a shrewd understanding of the power of the photograph to shape public opinion.\n\nThroughout 1937, Taro visited several frontlines, either with Capa or on her own. They managed to return to Paris for a short vacation in July that year, celebrating Bastille Day by dancing in the streets below Sacre Coeur and, according to Schaber, hatching \"great plans for the future\". Taro then returned to Spain alone, despite the growing concerns of her friends who, having seen her recent photographs of the fighting, feared for her safety.\n\nDefying a ban on journalists travelling to the front, she once again made her way to Brunete with the Canadian journalist Ted Allan, her close friend, travelling companion and soon-to-be lover. According to Allan's diaries, written later, they spent \"mornings afternoons and evenings together chasing stories... For three or four weeks we were constant companions. And finally, one afternoon, we ended up in her hotel room.\" She told Allan: \"Capa is my friend, my copain,\" and said she might be travelling to China with him. \"Nothing was settled,\" wrote Allan. \"Everything was possible.\"\n\nOn Sunday 25July, the pair found themselves trapped in a foxhole near Brunete as bombs fell around them relentlessly. Taro kept on photographing, often holding her camera high above her head to capture the carnage. Allan protected her with a film camera as shrapnel and rocks fell around them. Then, as republican troops began pulling out of the area, Taro and Allan ran out of the foxhole and hitched a ride on the running board of a car while the planes continued to strafe the retreating convoy. In the chaos, the car was then rammed by an out-of-control republican tank and the couple were thrown into the dirt. Transported to a nearby field hospital, Taro died from her injuries in the early hours of the following morning. She was 26. The injured Allan did not get to see her again. According to Irene Golden, the nurse who was on duty, her last words were: \"Did they take care of my camera?\"\n\nGerda Taro's funeral in Paris was attended by tens of thousands of mourners, including Capa, Chim and Ted Allan. Orchestrated by the French communist party, which claimed her as one of its own, it became, as Schaber puts it, \"a spectacular manifestation of international solidarity with the Spanish republic\". In death, Gerda Taro became a hero. Robert Capa went on to become the most celebrated and mythologised war photographer of the century until he, too, died in action in Indochina in 1954 at the age of 40. \"He never talked about her,\" says the photographer Ata Kand\u00f3 in The Mexican Suitcase.\n\nGerda Taro has now fully emerged from the shadow of Capa as an important photographer in her own right. Many photographs attributed to him \u2013 they initially shared the byline CAPA \u2013 have now been identified as hers. \"She was a pioneering woman both as a photographer and a political activist,\" says Ziff. \"She was very liberated for her time, putting her work before any more traditional female role. She had reinvented herself \u2013 but the Capa myth was so strong that, even when she died, some newspapers described her as Robert Capa's wife. Their lives were entwined, but she was very much her own woman, and he knew that. They both believed that their photographs could change the world and change the way people think. And their photographs did.\"\n\nFor details of The Mexican Suitcase, go to themexicansuitcase.com.

Clients can reserve a time, pick their clothing preferences and show up to a glamorous, personalized fitting.\n\n\u201cIf they come to the showroom and have a great experience and sip champagne and are chatting, they feel a little more comfortable trying on clothes that may be sleeveless or try a higher price-point that they\u2019re used to,\u201d Cheshire says.\n\nCheshire says she wanted to bring the human experience back to shopping for plus-size clothing. Many of her customers are used going into a store with straight-size friends and knowing that they won\u2019t be able to wear the clothes, she said. But the HeyGorgeous showroom changes that.\n\n\u201cYou want to experience the fun of shopping with your friends,\u201d Cheshire says. \u201cI want to give that opportunity to women who never had that before. It\u2019s quite exciting when you\u2019re finding clothes that your [non-plus-size] friends can\u2019t fit into or doesn\u2019t come in their size. I think there\u2019s something to be said for that experience.\u201d\n\nHeyGorgeous isn\u2019t the only plus-size ecommerce player exploring brick-and-mortar outposts. Online retailer ModCloth, which sells clothing from sizes XS to 4X, has been experimenting with in-person shops. In April, ModCloth decided to open a Los Angeles pop-up shop, called ModCloth IRL (in real life).\n\n\u201cMost of the folks at ModCloth had never interacted with the customer,\u201dsays CEO Matt Kaness. So they decided to do ModCloth IRL to allow the actual buyers and design team to work with customers by taking measurements, helping shoppers with fit and giving styling advice.\n\nWhen the pop-up was a hit, ModCloth opened a temporary fit shop in San Francisco with the intent of staying open for three weeks. Kaness says the shop has done so well that company has renewed the lease twice and now plans to remain open until early January.\n\nKaness, too, says he\u2019s witnessed the power of giving plus-size women a place to shop in the real world. He recounts a story told to him by Christine Shoptaw de Chavez, ModCloth\u2019s tech design manager. According to Kaness, Shoptaw de Chavez was helping one of the pop-up customers, when the shopper apologized for her body shape.\n\n\u201cChristine said, \u2018You\u2019re exactly the size that you should be. Don\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s our job to make you feel beautiful,\u2019 And the woman started crying,\u201d says Kaness.\n\nFor Kaness, that fit shops are a way to create that type of relationship between ModCloth and more of the company\u2019s customers.\n\n\u201cAs we thought about the future for ModCloth offline, it was that experience in a fitting room that one customer had that I think inspired all of us to want to recreate that,\u201d says Kaness.\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.",

        "text": "Edward Snowden has condemned Australian law enforcement for collecting the communications records of a Guardian journalist without a warrant.\n\nThe world\u2019s most prominent whistleblower, who disclosed dragnet surveillance unprecedented in its scale by the National Security Agency and its allies, singled out for critique the Australian government\u2019s contention that it broke no laws in its leak investigation of Paul Farrell, a Guardian reporter who in 2014 exposed the inner workings of Australia\u2019s maritime interception of asylum seekers.\n\nRelated: Australia's attacks on journalists' sources are about politics, not national security\n\n\u201cPolice in developed democracies don\u2019t pore over journalists\u2019 private activities to hunt down confidential sources,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThe Australian federal police are defending such operations as perfectly legal, but that\u2019s really the problem, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes the scandal is not what law was broken, but what the law allows.\u201d\n\nThroughout 2015 the Australian parliament enacted a series of controversial laws that curbed privacy and freedom of expression rights.\n\nGeoffrey King, director of the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Technology Program, said the AFP\u2019s actions were \u201cobviously outrageous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis should not be happening. But it is the inevitable result of mandatory data retention and mass surveillance, which is neither necessary nor proportional to any threat,\u201d King said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the values that we all adhere to, to good counter-terrorism strategy, and it certainly doesn\u2019t line up with a free and open society where journalists can do their jobs.\u201d\n\nIn March 2015 the Australian Senate passed legislation requiring internet and mobile phone companies to retain customer metadata for 24 months. The bill was vehemently opposed by the Australian Greens, whose communications spokesman, Senator Scott Ludlam, called its new provisions a \u201cform of mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nAlthough a last-minute amendment obliged security agencies to get a warrant before accessing a journalist\u2019s metadata, the law essentially expands the Australian government\u2019s ability to conduct dragnet surveillance.\n\nAustralia, along with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, is part of the Five Eyes signals-intelligence sharing network.\n\nDocuments leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that Australian spying authorities had offered to share bulk metadata of ordinary Australian citizens with their partners in the Five Eyes network. Other documents Snowden leaked revealed Australian spies had attempted to listen in to the phone calls of former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, causing an extended diplomatic rift between the two countries.\n\nThe investigation into Farrell\u2019s sources, for a story relating to the activities of an Australian customs vessel and a controversial operation to turn back a boat carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia, was conducted in 2014, before the amendment passed parliament. Law enforcement did not need a warrant for accessing the information at the time.\n\nThe case marks the first time the AFP has confirmed seeking access to a journalist\u2019s metadata in a specific case, although the agency has admitted to investigating several journalists reporting on Australian immigration.\n\nThe acknowledgement that authorities had sought access to Farrell\u2019s records was only divulged after the reporter lodged a complaint with Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner under the country\u2019s Privacy Act.\n\nRelated: The AFP and me: how one of my asylum stories sparked a 200-page police investigation\n\nIn July 2015, the Australian government passed the Border Force Act, which criminalises whistleblowing from within Australia\u2019s hardline immigration detention network, making it an offense punishable with up to two years in prison.\n\nThe country\u2019s \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders\u201d, a harsh, military-led crackdown on asylum seekers who attempt to enter Australia by boat, includes a policy of turning back boats carrying migrants and deporting every arrival including children to harsh, offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific island state of Nauru, for permanent resettlement.",

        "text": "Every Friday for four years, my friends and I would pop one bowl of popcorn and watch an episode of Friends from my \u201cbest of\u201d DVD box set. The concept of binge watching had yet to be invented, so we consumed the show in small bites\u2014two each week\u2014and in a haphazard order (I calculated which season it was based on haircuts). If I wanted to know why Ross and Rachel were together one episode and apart the next, I had to go buy another set of DVDs or beg my friends to re-enact episodes.\n\nBut now that Friends is hitting Netflix on Jan. 1, no child will ever have to wonder whether Ross and Rachel really were \u201con a break.\u201d\n\nAnyone with the time should watch every episode of this show. Even if the laugh track feels dated and the jokes a little less edgy than Seinfeld, Friends is worth revisiting as a cultural artifact: Its final episode in 2004 was watched by 52.5 million people, a number that has yet to be topped by any show since. But for those who don\u2019t have the time to watch 10 whole seasons and just want to skim, here are the character backgrounds and the episodes you ought to watch.\n\nWho Are the Eponymous \u201cFriends?\u201d\n\nMonica Geller (Courtney Cox): Ross\u2019 sister, Phoebe\u2019s old roommate, Chandler and Monica\u2019s neighbor and Rachel\u2019s best friend from high school, Monica was conceived as the lynchpin of the group. Though she\u2019s a neat freak and a bit bossy, she acts as the de facto mom to the rest of the friends. At the beginning of the show, she takes Rachel in as her new roommate.\n\nRachel Green (Jennifer Aniston): At the beginning of the show, Rachel runs away from her wedding in order to try to forge a life of her own. A bit of a spoiled brat, she moves in with Monica and takes a job as a waitress at Central Perk (the coffee shop where the group spends most of its time) though she aspires to work in fashion. Rachel dates Ross on-again and off-again throughout the entire series.\n\nPhoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow): The oddball of the group, Phoebe is a professional masseuse and amateur musician. (Her claim to fame is the song \u201cSmelly Cat.\u201d) Though she has a bleak past\u2014Phoebe was homeless after her father abandoned the family and her mother committed suicide\u2014she is relentlessly optimistic. Phoebe and Monica used to live together, but Phoebe has moved out by the time the show starts.\n\nChandler Bing (Matthew Perry): Chandler first met Ross in college when the two were roommates. When he moved to New York, he became roommates with Joey across the hall from Monica and Phoebe. None of the friends know what Chandler does for a living\u2014something with numbers, maybe? Scarred by his parents\u2019 divorce, Chandler has major commitment issues. The self-described \u201cfunny one,\u201d he cracks jokes and makes sarcastic observations whenever the friends are hanging out.\n\nJoey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc): Though Joey isn\u2019t the smartest of the gang\u2014in fact, he\u2019s incredibly dumb\u2014he does do well with the ladies, wooing a new woman almost every episode. An aspiring actor, he relies on best friend and roommate Chandler financially until he gets his big break on a soap opera.\n\nRoss Geller (David Schwimmer): Ross is probably the nerdiest of the group. A paleontologist, he obsesses over dinosaurs, grammar and documentaries. Yet since high school, Ross has had a crush on the popular Rachel (his sister\u2019s best friend). But when Rachel reunites with the friends in the first episode, Ross\u2019 life is a bit complicated: His pregnant wife has just left him for a woman. Ross and Rachel\u2019s \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d chemistry drives much of the show.\n\nWho Are the Recurring Characters?\n\nGunther: Gunther works at Central Perk and has a not-so-secret crush on Rachel.\n\nRichard: Dr. Richard Burke is a friend of Monica and Ross\u2019 parents. He and Monica date seriously on-and-off throughout the series. Eventually their age difference causes problems in the relationship.\n\nJanice: The friends are always running into Chandler\u2019s ex with an unbearable voice and a penchant for yelling, \u201cOh. My. Gawd\u201d\n\nMike: In the later seasons, Phoebe meets and dates Mike (played by Paul Rudd!), a corporate lawyer-turned-musician who falls for her quirks\n\nUrsula: Ursula is Phoebe\u2019s twin sister (also played by Kudrow) who may be even crazier than Phoebe. The two have a rocky relationship.\n\nCarol: Carol is Ross\u2019 lesbian ex-wife and the father of his child, Ben. Carol and her wife, Susan, share custody of Ben with Ross.\n\nFrank Jr.: Phoebe eventually finds out that she has a half-brother. When he falls in love and marries his much older teacher, Phoebe acts as their surrogate.\n\nEmily: Ross gets engaged to Emily, a British woman, after a very short courtship.\n\nThe One With the Blackout (Season 1): When all of New York goes dark, the friends get to know each other a little better.\n\nThe One With the Poker (Season 1): The girls try to beat the boys at poker.\n\nThe One With the Prom Video (Season 2): The gang watches an old video of Rachel and Monica getting ready for prom and finds out romantic secrets about some of the friends\u2019 pasts.\n\nThe One Where Ross Finds Out (Season 2): Ross realizes that Rachel used to like him back in the day, after all.\n\nThe One Where No One\u2019s Ready (Season 3): Ross starts to lose it when everyone is late for his big event.\n\nThe One With the Football (Season 3): After the gang finds out Ross and Monica used to compete for the Geller Cup (a.k.a. a troll doll stapled to a 2\u00d74) in a football game every Thanksgiving, they play each other in a game themselves.\n\nThe One With All the Embryos (Season 4): While Phoebe is examined for the implantation of embryos, Rachel and Monica compete against Joey and Chandler in a quiz game to see which pair knows the other better.\n\nThe One With Chandler in a Box (Season 4): Joey punishes Chandler for kissing his girlfriend by making him spend Thanksgiving in a box.\n\nThe One With Ross\u2019 Wedding (Season 4): Rachel rushes to London to stop Ross\u2019 wedding to Emily.\n\nThe One With All the Thanksgivings (Season 5): The friends share their worst Thanksgivings. We flashback to when the friends were in high school.\n\nThe One Where Everybody Finds Out (Season 5): Monica and Chandler go to extreme lengths to try to hide a secret.\n\nThe One in Las Vegas (Season 5): The friends head to Vegas and make some impulse decisions.\n\nThe One Where Ross Got High (Season 6): Chandler tries to ingratiate himself with Monica\u2019s parents only to find out that they think he, not Ross, was the one smoking pot in their house during college.\n\nThe One With the Proposal (Season 6): Chandler pops the question.\n\nThe One With All the Cheesecakes (Season 7): Chandler and Rachel can\u2019t stop eating the cheesecake that\u2019s mistakenly delivered to their floor.\n\nThe One With Monica and Chandler\u2019s Wedding (Season 7): Monica and Chandler get married with Joey officiating.\n\nThe One With the Rumor (Season 8): Brad Pitt guest stars as Ross\u2019 high school friend who hates Rachel (note: Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt were married at the time).\n\nThe One With the Male Nanny (Season 9): Freddie Prinze Jr. guest stars as a manny with a sensitive streak that babysits Emma.\n\nThe One With Princess Conseula (Season 10): Phoebe discovers that when you get married, you can change your name to anything.\n\nThe Last One (Season 10): By the time you reach the final episode, you should be crying that this amazing show is ending.\n\nEvery year, the Friends gang gathered together for Thanksgiving. Some of these episodes involved guest stars (hey, Brad Pitt), others troll trophies handed out to whoever won a football game. But the Thanksgiving episodes were wonderful because they often involved flashbacks to the friends\u2019 high school and college years when Monica was fat, Rachel had yet to have her nose job and Ross and Chandler rocked ridiculous haircuts. Here they all are:\n\nSeason 1: The One Where Underdog Gets Away\n\nSeason 2: The One With the List\n\nSeason 3: The One With the Football\n\nSeason 4: The One With Chandler in a Box\n\nSeason 5: The One With All The Thanksgivings\n\nSeason 6: The One Where Ross Got High\n\nSeason 7: The One Where Chandler Doesn\u2019t Like Dogs\n\nSeason 8: The One With the Rumor\n\nSeason 9: The One With Rachel\u2019s Other Sister\n\nSeason 10: The One With the Late Thanksgiving",

Neither PwC, Deloitte, EY, nor Bain and Co. reveal their diversity numbers in this level of detail. What\u2019s more, IBM, another major Accenture competitor, is one of the few tech giants that still refuses to release its stats.\n\n\u201cWe already spend a lot of time and money and focus [on increasing diversity], and yet we\u2019re not making the progress that we want to, so we feel like we need to be disruptive,\u201d says Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, North America, on the company\u2019s decision to publish the data.\n\nThe release reveals that women account for about 36% of the company\u2019s total U.S. workforce.\n\nAccenture, which is No. 98 on Fortune\u2018s 100 Best Companies to Work For list, is roughly half white and a third Asian. Black employees make up 7.4% of the company\u2019s workforce, while Hispanic or Latino employees hold 6.3% of jobs.\n\nWomen lose some ground at the company\u2019s upper level, accounting for 31% of executives.\n\nThe executive ranks are also notably less diverse, with black and Hispanic employees accounting for just 4.4% and 3.7% of top jobs, respectively.\n\nIn addition, Accenture revealed that it currently employs 1,450 people who self-identify as persons with disabilities and 1,000 veterans. (The company has pledged to hire an additional 5,000 vets or spouses of vets by 2020.)\n\nAccenture has committed to releasing updated diversity numbers each year. Although it did not lay out specific goals for 2016, Sweet is clear that she expects the company to make gains over last year\u2019s stats: \u201cWe think we can do more.\u201d\n\nMaking the numbers public will hold the company accountable for showing improvement, she says. What\u2019s more, Sweet hopes that this new level of transparency will allow Accenture to have more explicit, productive discussions about race and gender internally.\n\nTo help speed the pace of change, the company also announced that it is starting a new referral program that will reward employees who refer women, black, Hispanic, and veteran candidates who end up getting hired. This comes on the heels of a slate of new parent-friendly policies announced last year, including 16 paid weeks of maternity leave and an option for new parents to work locally for one year after the birth of their child.\n\n\u201cWhen I took my new role as chief executive of North America, I had this realization that with 48,000 and a $14 billion business I had a real opportunity to make change \u2014 and I feel a deep sense of responsibility,\u201d Sweet says. \u201cI personally feel I will have failed if I do not make progress toward making us the most inclusive and diverse workforce in the U.S.\u201d",

And I\u2019m hardly alone. In short, we seem to have reached peak unicorn.\n\nIn response, many have shrugged and said something like, \u201cEven if all of these companies were to completely fail, it wouldn\u2019t really have a broad economic impact. The amount of venture capital invested each year is tiny compared to the public markets, and just half of the amount of VC invested in the dot-com boom.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not predicting that all of these companies will fail, or anything close to it. Instead, I think the next step will be a series of so-called \u201cdown rounds,\u201d or at least structured debt financings that don\u2019t officially affect equity values. Plus a bit more M&A activity.\n\nBut it\u2019s also not appropriate to brush off potential unicorn struggles as something that would only affect a small group of wealthy investors.\n\nWhen valuations begin to contract, so can company growth, particularly when it comes to hiring. Growth\u2014even in something as seemingly random as valuations\u2014begets growth. If capital availability tightens, it can lead to layoffs.\n\nIn response to a request from Fortune, research firm PitchBook reports that 91 U.S.-based unicorn companies employ around 57,000 people. And that\u2019s a low estimate, given that PitchBook doesn\u2019t have data on some companies and has dated figures for others.\n\nJust look at the employee count jumps for a few unicorns between August 2014 and August and/or September 2015:\n\nThe downside of the valuation peak is almost certain to result in fewer jobs, which has all sorts of negative economic consequences (less spending, etc.).\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying you should be shedding tears for tech workers, and I\u2019m sure that some San Francisco housing advocates would celebrate widespread tech layoffs. Instead, it\u2019s simply a reminder to all of us that these much-derided, made-up valuations of \u201cunicorns\u201d have tangible effects on real people.

But it can be helpful to understand the underlying poetic truth.\n\nHere are four ways the two Exodus stories diverge.\n\n1. The Bible: Exodus is a story of ethical and political redemption.\n\nThe Film: Hebrew slaves are freed, but racial controversy surrounding the film clouded the story\u2019s overall message of liberation. Scott selected white characters as Egyptians and Hebrews in the film. The only visible black characters are other slaves in Pharaoh\u2019s palace who do not appear to be liberated with the Hebrew people.\n\n2. The Bible: God is depicted as a king and man of war, who takes on Pharaoh, the God and King of the Egyptians.\n\nThe Film: The God-character is depicted as a child, played by eleven-year-old Isaac Andrews. It is unclear whether he represents God or a figment of Moses\u2019 imagination or an angel or something else. Moses is not sent to Pharaoh by God, but goes on his own. The drama in the film is inter-human, between Moses and Pharaoh than between God and Pharaoh.\n\n3. The Bible: Moses flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave.\n\nThe Film: Moses is kicked out of Egypt when Pharaoh realizes Moses is a Hebrew. Moses does appear to kill an Egyptian soldier, but that was in retaliation for the soldier calling Moses a slave. It was not Moses defending an oppressed brother or sister.\n\n4. The Bible: The Pharaoh is unnamed.\n\nThe Film: The setting is the reign of Ramses. Hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves are portrayed in the movie, but the actual population of all slaves and of Hebrew slaves is unknown. Scott appears to try to bring the historical setting of the time to life, but the reality is that the \u201chistorical\u201d Exodus story is hard to pin down. \u201cThere is a deliberate lack of specification [in the Bible],\u201d explains Ellen Davis, professor of Bible and practical theology at Duke Divinity School. \u201cPharaoh is the sort of quintessential oppressive ruler in the Bible, and that is how he is remembered in later literature, so he stands for the oppressor of the moment in a sense.\u201d",

        "text": "This piece originally appeared on STATnews.com.\n\nA boy in Pakistan became a local legend as a street performer in recent years by traversing hot coals and lancing his arms with knives without so much as a wince. A thousand miles away, in China, lived a family wracked by excruciating bouts of inexplicable pain, passed down generation after generation.\n\nScientists eventually determined what the boy and the family had in common: mutations in a gene that functions like an on-off switch for agony. Now, a bevy of biotech companies, including Genentech and Biogen biib , are staking big money on the idea that they can develop drugs that toggle that switch to relieve pain without the risk of addiction.\n\nThe gene in question is SCN9A, which is responsible for producing a pain-related protein called Nav1.7. In patients who feel nothing, SCN9A is pretty much broken. In those who feel searing random pain, the gene is cranking out far too much Nav1.7.\n\nThat discovery raises an obvious question: Can blocking Nav1.7 provide relief for many types of pain \u2014 and someday, perhaps, replace dangerous opioid therapies?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the dream,\u201d said David Hackos, a senior scientist at Genentech, which has two Nav1.7 treatments in the first stage of clinical development.\n\nIt\u2019s too early make any sweeping predictions \u2014 and, indeed, a Pfizer pill targeting Nav1.7 has already stumbled \u2014 but the pharma industry clearly sees the potential for a blockbuster.\n\nFor more on Health and Technology, watch this video:\n\nLast year, Biogen paid $200 million for a firm called Convergence Pharmaceuticals to get its hands on some Nav1.7 inhibitors. Amgen amgn is in the early stages with a similar project. And Purdue Pharma, the controversial maker of opioid therapy OxyContin, launched a joint venture last year specifically focused on Nav1.7 drugs.\n\nEach is betting that this novel approach to pain relief could upend the standard of care for chronic aches, which are now often treated with weak anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or with opioids, which bring serious side effects and the potential for abuse.\n\nOpioid prescriptions have more than quadrupled since 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioid abuse kills about 30,000 Americans each year, according to the agency, and about half of those deaths result from prescribed therapies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous need for innovative, effective, and safe treatment modalities,\u201d said Dr. Jianguo Cheng, vice president of scientific affairs at the American Academy of Pain Medicine. \u201cIf it\u2019s truly effective, it could be revolutionary.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s early days yet for Nav1.7, and investigators have much to prove before anyone can pencil in billion-dollar sales.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of how good the target is, it\u2019s going to be tough sailing,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Waxman, a professor of neurology at Yale Medical School and West Haven Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nSide effects, for instance, will need to be closely scrutinized, Waxman said. The pain-free patients born with faulty SCN9A genes are otherwise pretty much normal, but no one really knows what will happen to healthy patients when their Nav1.7 is blocked. Only a sizable clinical trial can determine for sure, Waxman said.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s hard to know when pain drugs are working. Many fields of drug development rely on biomarkers, measurable reactions that tell researchers whether their efforts are having an effect. In chronic pain, no such standards exist, Waxman said, forcing scientists to use less reliable measures like patient surveys.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of placebo effect. High among the major impediments to developing new pain treatments is the sudden, baffling rise in sugar pill efficacy. Last year, researchers in Canada surveyed pain trials over 23 years and discovered that while active drugs performed pretty much the same, placebos grew more and more effective.\n\nAnd the Nav1.7 field already has at least one clinical disappointment on the books.\n\nA pill tested by Pfizer did well in patients with inherited erythromelalgia, the genetic condition found in the Chinese family, but had little effect on dental pain. A later study testing the same pill on nerve pain related to diabetes was similarly disappointing, and Pfizer quietly shelved the effort last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating area,\u201d said Douglas Krafte, who worked on the program. \u201cThe science has been so fascinating, and the drug discovery has been challenging.\u201d\n\nKrafte, who is now the chief scientist at the pharma contractor Icagen, believes there\u2019s plenty reason to be optimistic that Nav1.7 will pan out. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right way to approach it.\n\n\u201cThis is just part of the process of making a new kind of pain drug,\u201d said Genentech\u2019s Hackos. \u201cIt\u2019s one that may take years, but we\u2019re making a lot of progress.\u201d",

        "text": "The Chicago teachers strike has put Democrats in a difficult position. Teacher unions are the most powerful constituency in the Democratic Party, but their interests are ever more clearly at odds with taxpayers and inner-city families. Chicago is reviving scenes from the last crisis of liberalism in the 1970s, when municipal unions drove many American cities to disorder and bankruptcy. Where did their power come from?\n\nBefore the 1950s, government-employee unions were almost inconceivable. When the Boston police unionized and went on strike in 1919, the ensuing chaos\u2014rioting and looting\u2014crippled the public-union idea. Massachusetts Gov. Calvin Coolidge became a national hero by breaking the strike, issuing the dictum: \"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.\" President Woodrow Wilson called the strike \"an intolerable crime against civilization.\"\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt also rejected government unionism. He told the head of the Federation of Federal Employees in 1937 that collective bargaining \"cannot be transplanted into the public service. The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer\" because \"the employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws.\"\n\nFDR pointed out the obvious, that the government is sovereign. If an organization can compel the government to do something, then that organization will be the real sovereign. Thus the National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act of 1935 gave private-sector unions the power to compel employers to bargain, but the act excluded government workers. It declared that federal and state and local governments were not \"employers\" under its terms.\n\nPostwar prosperity and the great increase of public employment revived the public union idea. By 1970, nearly 20% of American workers worked for the government. (In 1900: 4%.) The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees led the effort to persuade a state to allow public-employee unionization, and Afscme prevailed in Wisconsin in 1958. New York City and other cities also permitted their workers to unionize.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy issued an executive order 50 years ago that broke the dam. The order did not permit federal employees to bargain over wages (these are still set by Congress), or to force workers to join a union or to strike (no state or city allowed that), but Kennedy's directive did lead to unionization of the federal workforce. And it gave great impetus to more liberal state and local laws. Government-union membership rose tenfold in the 1960s.\n\nThings soon got ugly. The Wagner Act had fomented labor militancy, notably sit-down strikes in 1937 that disrupted manufacturing and retarded the economy. But in the late 1960s and 1970s, federal and state union-promoting laws produced unprecedented strikes by teachers, garbage collectors, postal workers and others, even though every state prohibited strikes by public employees.\n\nAfscme began to arouse resentment from other union federations\u2014especially the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees International Union. Afscme's abrasive president, Jerry Wurf, became an easy target for his opponents. He was said to have advised Baltimore firefighters to \"let Baltimore burn\" if union demands were not met; Wurf was subsequently regarded as generally having a let-it-burn attitude.\n\nIn 1976 the Supreme Court derailed a movement to enact the National Public Employment Relations Law (\"a Wagner Act for public employees,\" as supporters described it) led by Rep. William Clay of Missouri. The court held that Congress could not apply federal labor laws to state employees. The justices stated the obvious, that \"the States as states stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation.\"\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, the budgetary burdens imposed by public unions had helped revive conservative movements, leading to the elections of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. Undeterred, William Clay told the Professional Air Traffic Controllers at Patco's 1980 convention to \"revise your political thinking. It should start with the premise that you have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests. It must be selfish and pragmatic.\" He told them to \"learn the rules of the game,\" which were \"that you don't put the interest of any other group ahead of your own. What's good for the federal employees must be interpreted as being good for the nation.\" The take-no-prisoners message helps explain why President Reagan fired and replaced the striking controllers, and why the public overwhelmingly supported him.\n\nHistorians tend to depict the Patco strike as a replay of the 1919 Boston police strike, with Reagan as the new Coolidge. But breaking the Patco strike had zero impact on public unionism. It may have cooled the willingness to strike, but unions continued to flourish. Public employment and government unionism have grown more than the population since 1980. The Patco replacements soon joined the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and carried on Patco's work.\n\nNor did the breaking of the strike \"send a signal\" to private employers to take a hard line against their unions, as some historians of the time have suggested. The factors responsible for private-union decline antedated the Patco strike and continued after it. Reagan ultimately may have even helped the public-employee union movement: By stoking the nation's economic revival in the 1980s, he made the costs of public unions begin to seem less onerous, and polls suggested that American worries about the matter declined.\n\nPublic unions do well in flush times like the 1950s and 1960s, but they suffer when taxpayers feel their true cost, as in the 1970s\u2014and today.\n\nMr. Moreno, a professor of history at Hillsdale College, is the author of \"The American State from the Civil War to the New Deal,\" forthcoming from Cambridge University Press.",
        "generated": "The Chicago teachers strike has highlighted the growing power of public employee unions, which have been able to demand higher wages and benefits despite the economic challenges faced by cities and states. This has put Democrats in a difficult position, as they rely on the support of teacher unions but also need to address the fiscal crisis. The rise of public employee unions can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, when the federal government and states began to allow collective bargaining for public workers. The Wagner Act of 1935 gave private-sector unions the power to compel employers to bargain, but excluded government workers. President John F. Kennedy's executive order in 1962 allowed federal employees to unionize, leading to a rapid increase in government-union membership. The 1970s saw a wave of strikes by public employees, including teachers, garbage collectors, and postal workers, despite the fact that every state prohibited strikes by public employees. The Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that Congress could not apply federal labor laws to state employees. The Professional Air Traffic Controllers (Patco) strike in 1980, which was broken by President Ronald Reagan, had little impact on public unionism, and public employment and government unionism have continued to grow since then.",

        "text": "After he resigned as Conservative leader in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith found a new purpose in his quest for social justice. That cause inspired him to co-found the Centre for Social Justice and brought him back to frontline politics, despite his bruising experience in the leader\u2019s chair. Ultimately, it also led him to resign from the government on Friday, as his frustration at what he saw as endless obstruction from the Treasury boiled over.\n\nAll former cabinet ministers find that the transition to the backbenches leaves them with spare time and energy. Some write books, some go on the speaking circuit and others commit it all to seeking a route back to the top table. Duncan Smith will presumably commit to the campaign to leave the European Union, a cause which has long been close to his heart. That\u2019s not to say he will stop talking about social reform and start talking about Brexit \u2013 rather, he has a unique opportunity to explain why a Leave vote would help Britain become a fairer society.\n\nThe early skirmishes of the referendum campaign have largely focused on either macro-policy, like international trade rules, or micro-frippery, like the views of the monarch. As the debate gets into full swing, both sides will need to explain how their preferred outcome will directly affect voters\u2019 day-to-day lives.\n\nWelfare and work are an essential part of that picture \u2013 and there is an as-yet-unheard case that both could be improved by voting to leave. Duncan Smith has long argued that constructing a fairer society requires money and the freedom to reform the welfare system. Leaving the EU would provide both. Ultimately, the referendum in June is about control \u2013 control of our laws, our public policy and our public spending. On each front, EU membership compromises Britain\u2019s ability to act freely and flexibly to address its social problems.\n\nThe government itself sought through the renegotiation to regain power over who can claim welfare in the UK. The two central requests were set out in the Conservative manifesto \u2013 that benefits should not be paid for those children whose parents work here but who do not themselves live in this country, and that new arrivals should work for four years before they become eligible to access the welfare system. These were modest and popular demands, endorsed in a general election, but the EU still rejected them, watering down each so heavily that the process more closely resembled policy homeopathy than a renegotiation.\n\nThat failure sent a clear message about the reality of EU membership \u2013 we have lost the right to define the rules of our own welfare state, and have thus lost the ability to manage its costs or focus its resources as we wish.\n\nWhatever your preference might be regarding the size and nature of the welfare system, it is hard to argue that the voters who fund it and use it should not have democratic control of its terms and scope. During the renegotiation, Duncan Smith identified the four-year waiting period before migrant workers could access benefits as \u201ccrucial\u201d, and with good reason. With a stubbornly large deficit, there is no unlimited source of money for the welfare state; therefore, the greater the number of people who have the right to claim benefits, the less money there can be for each recipient. If one argues, as he does, that a permanent improvement in the lives of those in the greatest need requires the allocation of sizeable up-front resources, then allowing unlimited access to in-work benefits for EU migrants reduces the opportunity to deliver a new life for those in the direst need.\n\nOne of the passages in the work and pensions secretary\u2019s resignation letter which will have caused the most pain in Downing Street will be the charge that the government\u2019s fiscal priorities are skewed \u2013 not least that they protect benefits for better-off pensioners while cutting from the young.\n\nThat argument, too, can extend to our EU membership \u2013 it is both absurd and unjust to pay such vast amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money to Brussels while battling to reduce spending on public services at home.\n\nAll the political agony and fury of the coalition years saw a total of \u00a317bn saved from the welfare budget. And yet last year our gross contribution to the EU exceeded \u00a319bn. Even if a post-Brexit government wanted to continue all EU spending \u2013 an unlikely circumstance given the wasteful way in which Brussels spends much of our money \u2013 that would leave a net saving of over \u00a310bn.\n\nDuncan Smith would be justified in arguing that it is more socially just to take money from well-paid Eurocrats than from British welfare recipients.\n\nMark Wallace is executive editor of ConservativeHome",

        "text": "As public spending cuts have an impact across European and North American countries, the debate over the value of overseas aid is reaching new levels of intensity, no more so than in the United Kingdom where the Coalition has pledged to ringfence and increase the aid budget to reach 0.7 per cent of its Gross National Income from 2013. The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan adds a new and urgent perspective, tragically showing how even a rich and developed nation can find itself in need of external humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe debate encourages us to think about the role of foreign aid in developing countries \u2013 its potential, its benefits, as well as its possible pitfalls. Is foreign aid affordable? Does the need for foreign aid outweigh domestic calls on public spending? Will it reduce poverty or instead be lost to corruption? Will it lead to a culture of dependency? These are critical questions for governments and the public they represent, and I would like to add my thoughts both from the perspective of President of Liberia and Goodwill Ambassador for Water and Sanitation in Africa.\n\nWhether you measure poverty by the one and a half billion people living on less than a pound a day, the one billion who go hungry each day, or other indicators such as the eight million children who die each year from preventable diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, poverty on the scale it exists today is an affront to our common humanity. It also carries a significance beyond national borders and is therefore of global importance. In an increasingly interlinked world, countries are more dependent on one another for their prosperity, security and safety, and to answer challenges such as climate change.\n\nI have seen, at first\u2013hand, how aid, effectively targeted and delivered, reduces poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa there have been major improvements in child health and in primary school enrolment over the last two decades. To choose one example, between 1999 and 2004, the continent achieved one of the largest reductions in measles\u2019 deaths ever seen. These positive results and outcomes would not have been possible without the support of donors such as the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), complementing the resources which low-income countries mobilize domestically. In my own country, Liberia, both humanitarian and development aid have helped us recover and rebuild from the devastation and trauma of civil war, improving the future for the millions directly involved and affected.\n\nThe British public is right to demand that their aid be corruption-free. It is the poor who bear the heaviest burden of corruption \u2013 it pushes them further into poverty, and deepens inequality and injustice. Corruption is a continual risk to progress, and combating it must be a joint endeavour pursued tirelessly by developed and developing countries. In Liberia, I declared a zero tolerance on corruption when I assumed office, and I continue to stand by this declaration. I believe passionately that all governments receiving aid have an enduring obligation to ensure that it is properly used. When they do so, and their anti-corruption efforts complement donor transparency and independent monitoring such as adopted by DFID, I have no doubt that aid can and does achieve its essential objectives.\n\nCitizens in both the North and South also have a right to demand that aid achieves value for money, and in this light I am pleased to see that DFID has identified increasing the number of people with access to clean water and sanitation as a top priority for Liberia as well as other African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi and Mozambique. There can be few more important and effective interventions, as diarrhoea, caused by lack of access to these basic human rights, is the biggest killer of children under five in Africa. With access to safe water and sanitation, lives are saved, health outcomes are improved, more children, especially girls, can go to school, and stability thrives. It is hardly surprising that the United Nations Development Programme estimates that for every \u00a31 invested in water and sanitation, \u00a38 is returned to the economy through increased productivity.\n\nThe UK has a long-sustained dedication to reducing poverty, inequality and inequity in the developing world, and for this the public should be proud. And whilst it can only be right in the current context that aid budgets in all donor countries undergo increased scrutiny, and that strong results and value for money are both demanded and expected, I believe it would be a fatal mistake for governments to adopt aid-sceptic or, worse still, anti-aid approaches.\n\nAid should, of course, never be an end in itself. Provided that it is delivered on the basis of being timely, temporary, and targeted, it can save lives and transform life chances in today\u2019s developing world, just as the Marshall Plan helped rebuild European economies after the long years of war, laying the platform for stability and prosperity. African entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim recently commented that the main objective of aid is to abolish the need for aid. Let this inform our approach as our vision for Africa and other developing nations going forward.\n\nHer Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is President of the Republic of Liberia and Goodwill Ambassador for Water and Sanitation in Africa.",

        "text": "There are two great themes running through this book. One is Jerry Lee\u2019s love-hate relationship with Elvis; the other is his struggle with the Devil.\n\nLewis arrived at Sun determined to topple Elvis from his throne as the king of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2013 and for a brief while he did. Shortly before departing for army service in Germany, Lewis claims, a tearful Presley bequeathed him his crown, saying, \u201cYou got it. Take it. Take the whole damn thing.\u201d\n\nWhile Elvis meekly allowed himself to be tamed and neutered by the egregious Colonel Tom Parker, Lewis \u2013 whom nobody ever described as \u201cmeek\u201d \u2013 remained the authentic article. In 1977, the day after Elvis died, Lewis was asked by a reporter what he felt on hearing the news. He replied: \u201cGlad. Just another one out of the way. I mean, Elvis this, Elvis that. All we hear is Elvis. What the s--- did Elvis ever do except take dope I couldn\u2019t get a hold of?\u201d He now explains that he was drunk, \u201cand hurting and angry\u201d. The truth is \u201cI loved Elvis\u201d. But not so much as to hand him back the crown. Pondering how they rank in the pantheon of music, Lewis remains unbowed: \u201cAfter me was Elvis.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019s upbringing was Pentecostal Christian \u2013 of the vengeful Jehovah rather than the gentle Jesus school. The fear of divine retribution did not, as Bragg delicately puts it, mean that he would grow up to adhere to the teachings, \u201cjust that he knew in his heart when he did wrong\u201d. Which was frequently.\n\nThe question that seems to have most tormented him, however, was whether you could play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and still go to heaven. When a troubled Lewis asked Elvis, who had come from an identical background, the question, Elvis's face, he claims, \u201cturned blood red\u201d and he snapped back: \u201cDon\u2019t you never ask me that again.\u201d\n\nIt behoves any writer contemplating the state of Lewis\u2019s soul to write in cadences pitched somewhere between southern-fried folk wisdom and the Book of Revelation \u2013 and Bragg rises manfully to the challenge. \u201cThe demons even outran the music, and he found he could not run fast enough to beat them and still hold the road,\u201d he writes.\n\nEven allowing for the fact that an authorised biography will err towards generosity, this book is hardly a character reference. Lewis emerges as cantankerous, boastful, threatening, possibly sociopathic. But Bragg remains ever-understanding.\n\nOne can well recognise, as Bragg puts it, that \u201cas a southern man\u201d, Lewis required guns \u201cin the same way other men require a pocket watch and suspenders\u201d; and shooting his bass player might well have been an accident. But still, one can\u2019t help thinking there was something decidedly careless in his handling of firearms. Having passed the time one night by shooting at random into a wall of his office, he awoke, hung-over, the next day to discover that the bullets had destroyed a display case of antique dentures in the dental practice next door. \u201cHe was relieved to find they were not actually in someone\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nHis greatest violence, however, was reserved for himself. Much of this book has all the appalling, rubbernecking fascination of a car crash \u2013 something with which Lewis, a man who \u201chad never seen anything wrong with going out and driving off a good drunk\u201d, was all too familiar. His drug consumption reads like a pharmaceutical manual: biphetamines, Placidyls, Desbutal.\n\nThe litany of tragedy is similarly stupefying. One son died in a swimming pool. So did his fourth wife. Another son died in a road accident. By way of consolation, the women (countless) \u201cwere always sympathetic with me\u201d. At the age of 47, he married a 25-year-old, Shawn Stephens, who two months later was found dead in her bed. An autopsy revealed the painkiller methadone in her system at 10 times the normal dose. A grand jury reviewed the case but could find no grounds for indictment. In 1984, doctors cut away a third of Lewis\u2019s stomach after he was diagnosed with perforated ulcers. In 1986, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, looking \u201clike a man who had walked through a fire and been put out just in time\u201d.\n\nMiraculously, in 2008, he returned to the Top 30 with an album featuring guest artists including Keith Richards, B B King and Bruce Springsteen. At the age of 79, having finally kicked his addiction to pills and whatever else, \u201cThe Killer\u201d now passes much of his time in repose, lying in bed at his ranch, with his guns on the dressing table and an ill-tempered chihuahua named Topaz Junior on the quilt between his feet.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story by Rick Bragg\n\n512pp, Canongate, Telegraph offer price: \u00a317 (PLUS \u00a31.95 p&p) (RRP \u00a320, ebook \u00a38.54) .

        "text": "\"I used to think I was this made man,\" says entrepreneur Glenn Kelman. \"That's what they tell you after you take a company public.\"\n\nIn 1996 Mr. Kelman co-founded Plumtree, a business-software firm that went public in 2002. After that, he assumed that his next idea was as good as paid for.\n\n\"Whatever I thought of, they'd fund it,\" he says.\n\nThen, in 2006, Mr. Kelman became chief executive of a real-estate startup, Redfin Corp.\n\nRedfin sounds like it would be catnip for technology investors. The company aims to overhaul how people buy and sell houses, using software and data to improve real-estate agents' customer service. Real estate is an opaque, expensive insider's game\u2014exactly the kind of business that is ripe for getting blown up by a less-expensive, more-convenient Web-powered service.\n\n\"We wanted to change the whole thing in the consumers' favor,\" Mr. Kelman says, his voice straining with a revolutionary's passion. \"We wanted you to have an agent who was on your side, who used technology the whole way through the process and who charged half the price.\"\n\nBut whenever Mr. Kelman shopped his plan in Silicon Valley, venture capitalists looked at him funny. He raised millions of dollars, but the money came fitfully, often at lower valuations than he expected.\n\nEventually Mr. Kelman realized the problem. Like Soylent Green, Redfin is made of people\u2014sales staff and customer-service representatives.\n\nTo tech investors, companies that depend on such people are old-fashioned. People are unpredictable and hard to manage. They are costly to hire and train, and their path to success is difficult to set into an algorithm. People don't scale.\n\nYet Redfin is one of a handful of startups showing that people can make a big difference. Mr. Kelman believes that improving the real-estate business takes more than just better code. It takes better people, specifically, better real-estate agents. Consequently, Redfin has hired hundreds of agents on staff, people to whom it pays salaries, benefits and on whose work the company depends.\n\nAfter years of slow growth, Redfin is poised to hit it big. It's on track to book $100 million in revenue\u2014and turn a profit\u2014next year.\n\nAnd its path suggests that businesses that try to improve workers\u2014and not just code\u2014can be better for customers and, in the long run, better for the bottom line.\n\nLike Zillow Inc. and Trulia Inc., Redfin is partly a website that helps you find houses for sale. But unlike those companies, which make money through ads placed by traditional brokers, Redfin is a full-service brokerage. After you find your dream house on its site, Redfin makes money when you sign up with one of its agents to guide you through the home-buying process. (Its agents sell houses, too.)\n\nMr. Kelman says Redfin's unusual setup offers several advantages over traditional brokerages.\n\nFirst, it improves service. If you're touring a neighborhood and see a house for sale, you can order up a Redfin agent to drive over to show you the property quickly. In the company's most-established markets, Seattle, for instance, the agent can be at your service within an hour. (It takes longer in Redfin's newer markets, like Dallas). This works thanks to a blend of technology and management. Just as the Uber online ride service maps its drivers, Redfin keeps track of its agents' calendars and real-time locations. Unlike a traditional real-estate brokerage\u2014in which agents essentially are contractors of a brand, not employees\u2014Redfin's agents are salaried workers. The company can tell them where to go and what to do.\n\nRedfin helps soothe other home-buying frustrations as well. Redfin compiles detailed histories on competing brokerages' pricing strategies, strengthening Redfin agents' negotiating prowess. Redfin also conducts most of the home-buying process online, reducing paperwork. And if you're selling your house, Redfin can test offer prices on the Web, helping you to home in on the optimal price.\n\nThe biggest opportunity is price. Mr. Kelman says the incentives of traditional real-estate agents are misaligned with those of customers. If you're selling your house, your agent, who gets paid on commission, will prefer that you take a lowball offer over no offer. If you're buying, your agent will want you to bid higher than you might otherwise want\u2014or need\u2014to pay. Economists call this the Principal-Agent Problem, and it has proved stubbornly intractable in real estate.\n\nMr. Kelman says Redfin has a solution. About half a typical Redfin agent's pay comes through salary. The rest comes through commissions. But crucially, commissions are linked to detailed reviews that Redfin customers complete after sales. The reviews are posted online and affect each agent's future business. Your agent always has an incentive to please you. If pushing a client to close a deal will produce a bad review, the agent would rather not close.\n\nRedfin is still tiny. In its most-established locations, it has about 3% or 4% of the market. In bigger, newer markets, it seems nearly nonexistent.\n\nMr. Kelman concedes that his people-dependent model has slowed Redfin's growth. But he sees the prospect of long-term returns. \"After we hit a certain threshold in the market, our share begins to accelerate,\" he says. In other words, over time, better service begins to pay off.\n\nRedfin last month said it raised $50 million from T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Tiger Global Management LLC. Compared with tech-focused venture capitalists, Mr. Kelman says, these investors didn't care that Redfin might take several more years to realize its mission of revolutionizing real estate. They were willing to wait, he says.\n\n\"Most of Silicon Valley isn't that patient.\"\n\nWrite to Farhad Manjoo at farhad.manjoo@wsj.com",

That means the end of ski season is near\u2014perfect timing for a little reflection on how technology has become front-and-center in the skiing experience.\n\nIt\u2019s been a spectacular winter for Lake Tahoe. After several years of drought, El Nino blessed California with the most snow it has had since 2012. But pristine powder isn\u2019t the only new thing on the slopes this year. Increasingly, mobile apps and social features are table stakes for Tahoe resorts, letting skiers track their vertical feet and purchase those annoying photos someone\u2019s always taking of you at the top of the mountain. As I discovered on a recent reporting expedition to Lake Tahoe (I swear, it was for work), even the way the mountains are groomed and artificial snow is made has changed. Just as you would expect, much of the process is now automated, controlled remotely by\u2014you guessed it\u2014mobile devices.\n\nA lot of the noticeable innovations on the slopes are about consumer-facing mobile features (and, of course, drones\u2014more on that in a bit). Vail Resorts, which owns the likes of Tahoe\u2019s Northstar and Heavenly, has had a chief information officer for years. It now employs a growing team of mobile apps developers. The company launched its EpicMix ski app about six years ago, but added features like social sharing in recent years. (One new addition that has yet to make it to Tahoe: a tool that shows wait times at different lifts.)\n\nBack when I first learned to ski, a frighteningly long time ago, the coolest \u201ctech\u201d on the mountain was the gondola. But it wasn\u2019t all that frighteningly long ago that cell phone reception was still spotty at the top of the mountain. Now, places like Vail-owned resorts are giving skiers more reasons to pull out their phones on the slopes\u2014not just to take selfies. The company says EpicMix now has about 700,000 users.\n\nThen there is the small matter of drones. At nearby Squaw Valley (not owned by Vail), skiers can pay $99 to have a drone film them making their way down the mountain. In order to make this dream-you-didn\u2019t-know-you-had come true, the resort partnered with a company called Cape Productions. \u201cWe are competing with lots of other opportunities for how people spend money on their leisure time,\u201d says Louis Gresham, one of the skiers-turned-techies who started Cape.\n\nAt this point, drones are a tiny business for ski resorts (Gresham says that in addition to sharing revenue with the resorts, Cape gives them access to the footage they shoot). But I\u2019m willing to bet that, like it or not, they will have a growing presence on the slopes. That is, of course, if the damn weather doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\nOne drawback to all those winter storms we\u2019ve been getting here in the California mountains: High winds and heavy precipitation make it very hard for drones to fly.

When that didn\u2019t work, Brinton\u2019s parents turned to something called reparative therapy.\n\nSome of the memories are hazy more than 10 years later, but Brinton does remember the tactics the counselor used. There was talk therapy, about how God disapproved, and there was aversion therapy, during which pictures of men touching men would be accompanied by the application of heat or ice. \u201cIt was pretty much mental torture,\u201d Brinton says. \u201cTo this day, I still have light pain when I shake hands with another male.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade after leading medical organizations abandoned the idea that homosexuality was something that could be cured or corrected, the concept of conversion therapy remains a particularly charged issue for LGBT advocates. Two states outlaw the practice and legislation is pending in another. But not all the momentum is against reparative therapy. Earlier this month the Texas Republican Party voted to include support for the practice in their party platform. Now a group of advocates and lawmakers are launching a new effort to ban licensed counselors from trying to change a minor\u2019s sexual orientation through therapy of any kind.\n\nOn June 24, the National Center for Lesbian Rights will announce the beginning of a campaign called #BornPerfect, an educational and legislative push to \u201cmake clear that every LGBT person is born perfect,\u201d says executive director Kate Kendell. \u201cIt is now generally understood that sexual orientation cannot and should not be changed and that efforts to change it are damaging.\u201d She believes that the time is right for the campaign, as LGBT people have become more accepted in society and medical establishments have come out against what is also called conversion therapy.\n\nOn June 16, the New York State assembly voted 86 to 28 to pass a reparative-therapy ban, and though Governor Andrew Cuomo expressed support for the bill, lawmakers in the GOP-controlled state senate blocked the measure from coming to the floor for a full vote. Had the senate passed the bill, New York would have become the third state, after California and New Jersey, to put such a law on the books.\n\nOpponents like Liberty Counsel, a legal organization affiliated with Liberty University, were also ready to file a lawsuit, much like those the organization filed against the California and New Jersey laws.\n\nDaniel Schmid, Liberty Counsel\u2019s lead litigator, says that bans on reparative therapy potentially violate the freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights of those who would perform or seek it. \u201cIf you allow [counselors] to talk about sexual orientation to minors, you can\u2019t allow only one viewpoint to be presented,\u201d he says. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against that argument in California last August, instead siding with the logic that such a law amounts to professional regulation, a condition for providing state counseling licenses. Schmid and his clients, including therapists and families, have appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nHomosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a diagnostic bible published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), in 1973. In 1998, the APA released a statement saying the organization \u201copposes any psychiatric treatment, such as \u2018reparative\u2019 or \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder, or based upon a prior assumption that the patient should change his/her homosexual orientation.\u201d Schmid argues that the statement is based more on politics than documentation of harm caused by such therapy.\n\nThe #BornPerfect campaign will aim to dissuade parents who might be considering reparative therapy by providing them access to psychological experts and those who have been through such treatment, like Brinton. \u201cWe have no doubt they love their children,\u201d Kendell says, noting that many parents might believe LGBT people lead more difficult lives and wish to spare their children from hardship. \u201cWe want parents to understand there are resources for them to come to terms with embracing their child as they are,\u201d she says, whether those are online or public forums. The campaign will also include ongoing legislative efforts in other states to pass reparative-therapy bans, though Kendell declined to say which will be next at this time for fear it would mobilize the movement\u2019s opponents.\n\nThough conversion therapy is largely associated with sexual orientation, the #BornPerfect campaign will also aim to prevent therapy that is aimed at changing a child\u2019s gender identity, in the cases that a child does not identify with the gender that corresponds with the sex that was assigned at birth. \u201cTo the extent that this is a budding practice,\u201d Kendell says, \u201cwe want to nip it.\u201d\n\nOne well-known reparative therapist is Joseph Nicolosi, based in Encino, Calif. A banner at the top of his website says, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have to Be Gay,\u201d with bullet points that advertise the ability to \u201cDiminish your unwanted homosexuality\u201d and \u201cDevelop your heterosexual potential.\u201d Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, which has also worked to oppose the reparative-therapy bans, argues that sexual orientation is \u201cfluid well into adulthood\u201d and can be influenced by factors such as a domineering mother or history of sexual abuse. \u201cA truly tolerant nation is one that respects the rights of all Americans,\u201d he says, \u201cnot just those who happen to be the political majority of a legislature.\u201d\n\nAfter a year and a half in therapy, and multiple suicide attempts, Brinton finally lied and promised to have been cured of homosexual thoughts. \u201cIt kept me in the closet for so many years,\u201d Brinton says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of internalized shame. And it\u2019s all related to just this nagging trauma of something\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

Sign up here.\n\nAs tough as the industry-wide transition to cloud computing has been for PC-era software companies, it has been even tougher for data center hardware suppliers.\n\nJust ask IBM ibm , which has recorded revenue declines for its last 15 quarters. Or EMC emc , which is looking for salvation in Dell\u2019s arms. But the darkest storm clouds are starting to lift, at least for hardware companies who have retooled their equipment for the cloud era. Sometime during the past 12 months, it appears many businesses swapped the question, \u201cShould I move my IT operations to the cloud?\u201d for this one \u201cWhen is the best time for our cloud transition?\u201d\n\nUnder the cloud computing model, applications and other IT resources are delivered via pools of servers, storage devices, and networking gear over which businesses may have very little management control. Slowly but surely, organizations of all sizes are opting to use these services for a larger portion of their IT operations.\n\nThat means, of course, that fewer companies are buying servers and other gear for their own data centers. Instead, more are opting to rent from the likes of Amazon amzn Web Services, Microsoft msft , and Google goog (the \u201cBig Three\u201d of cloud computing). The latest evidence lies in purchasing patterns reported last week by market research firm IDC.\n\nLast year, spending on hardware meant for big clouds increased 22% to almost $29 billion. Indeed, almost one-third of the fourth-quarter equipment revenue attributable to tech giants Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe , Dell, Cisco csco , EMC, and IBM was generated by hardware intended for cloud installations. We can expect more of the same this year: IDC projects spending on cloud-related computing hardware will top $38 billion, continuing to grow by double digits for at least the next several years. By 2020, spending on infrastructure for \u201cpublic\u201d cloud services\u2014those shared among businesses rather than dedicated to serving a single company\u2014will reach $37.5 billion.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of this transition has been Cisco, which sells equipment converging features of servers and networking gear. Revenue for that portion of its product portfolio grew almost 36% during the fourth quarter to $802 million, reports IDC.\n\nOf course, the hardware manufacturers are by no means out of the woods. Many of the biggest cloud service providers\u2014including Facebook fb and Amazon\u2014are opting to build their build their own gear to keep costs down while personalizing their design needs. Now that momentum is building, it\u2019s up to the likes of HPE, Dell/EMC, and Cisco to prove their value again.",

Measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, the quake mainly affected the town of Mashiki on the outskirts of Kumamoto city.\n\nThe real devastation, however, came around 48 hours later, when the same region was struck by a far more powerful, magnitude 7.3 quake. At least 33 others were killed in the second quake, which left close to 200,000 displaced and thousands of homes without electricity or running water.\n\nThe same day as the second temblor, around 9,000 miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Ecuador was hit with an earthquake that far exceeded the destruction seen in Japan. Even as the death toll from the 7.8-magnitude quake rose to almost 600, the South American nation was rocked by several aftershocks \u2014 including one on Wednesday that measured 6.1.\n\nDespite the timing of the two disasters and their presence in the earthquake-prone zone known as the Ring of Fire, seismologists say a connection between them is unlikely and not necessarily indicative of a larger trend.\n\n\u201cWe do know that large earthquakes cluster,\u201d says Gary Gibson, a seismologist and professor at the University of Melbourne, adding that the most recent cluster \u2014 including a 6.9-magnitude tremor felt in Burma (Myanmar) last week that caused minimum damage \u2014 has been particularly active.\n\n\u201cThe last two or three weeks have been exceptional, there is no question about that,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cBut in terms of worrying about whether it means an even bigger one somewhere else, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nWu Pak-cheuk, who heads the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, tells TIME that a correlation between the two sets of earthquakes is highly unlikely, because they \u201care a little too far away, and not on the same [tectonic] plate.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, both countries were also hit with different types of quakes, with the two that hit Japan likely resulting from something called a strike-slip, that occurs along faults situated at a relatively shallow level. The Ecuador earthquake, on the other hand, occurred because of a process known as subduction \u2014 where one tectonic plate slides under another to create what is known as a \u201cmegathrust\u201d event.\n\nA geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey tells CNN, however, that research into a phenomenon called \u201cremote triggering\u201d \u2014 where an earthquake in one part of the world can cause another some distance away \u2014 is still ongoing.",

        "text": "A few years back, I used to tell people I was a comedian (if they asked, that is, not apropos of nothing). I decided to stop doing that when a good friend\u2019s teenage brother observed with earnest confusion, having spent 10 minutes talking to me, that I couldn\u2019t be a comedian, since I\u2019m not funny. These days, I say I\u2019m a writer. As well as finding the incident personally crushing, the brother\u2019s damning verdict made me realise something about the way people tend to think about what \u201cbeing funny\u201d is, and how it ought to manifest itself. To this logical lad, and many others, people are funny in the same way as they are \"tall\" or \"Japanese\" \u2013 it\u2019s an ever-present, empirically obvious part of their nature.\n\nThe reason I write all this is not simply to win an argument with my friend\u2019s younger brother, but to make a wider point about comedy, especially in literature. I\u2019ve recently been writing a stage adaptation of a Dostoevsky short story called The Crocodile, which is funny in ways that are playful and profound and pretty politically punchy. In the process of writing it, I\u2019ve come to learn that many people don\u2019t think of Dostoevsky as funny at all, and the assertion that he can be hilarious tends to meet with, at best, suspicion and, at worst, polite indulgence. Which is quite annoying for me, and, I imagine, had he the means of eavesdropping, maddening for him.\n\nLike my friend\u2019s brother, readers seem to have no problem declaring that a writer is or isn\u2019t funny without really justifying themselves or providing a list of the stuff that makes them laugh for us to assess their relative expertise or trustworthiness. Of all the areas of literature, humour has the strange privilege of being by far the most personal in appreciation and the most objective in judgment. Imagine if we talked about writers being \u201cmoving\u201d or \u201cinsightful\u201d in the same cack-handed way as we talk about them being \u201cfunny\u201d. I doubt that readers and critics would declare with the same confidence that \u201cDostoevsky isn\u2019t moving\u201d or that \u201cKafka isn\u2019t insightful\u201d as they might brazenly offer up a sentence like \u201cBeckett isn\u2019t funny\u201d. Which, by the way, he is. Sometimes.\n\n\u2022 100 funny jokes by 100 comedians\n\nAnyone who spends any time on the internet, especially among the lynch mobs who operate underneath every YouTube comedy clip, will be aware that the often innocent act of someone trying to be funny can make people murderously cross with each other. There are semi-religious wars raging online between fanatics who know in their heart what funny feels like, and make self-righteous pronouncements that crumble instantly under the weight of the most basic analysis. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t funny\u201d or \u201cGermans aren\u2019t funny\u201d, for example, are sentences that have the power to offend only because of the wilfully unsophisticated way we think about what \u201cbeing funny\u201d means. To say \u201cwomen aren\u2019t moving\u201d or \u201cGermans aren\u2019t wet\u201d wouldn\u2019t even make enough sense to be offensive. It would just be weird.\n\nThe Inbetweeners star Simon Bird will be perfroming in Basden's The Crocodile (Photo: Film4)\n\nIronically, the bloody-minded zeal that reduces all conversations about humour to people yelling \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d at each other is the very thing I find funniest in Dostoevsky\u2019s writing. Pomposity is one of the few growth industries in the age of the internet, and Dostoevsky\u2019s characters in stories like The Crocodile, The Gambler and Notes From the Underground are brilliantly observed, furiously funny forebears of the self-important online troll. I won\u2019t try to convince you of his comic genius here by quoting sentences out of context, because the only things that work well in isolation are one-liners, which, to be fair to the guy, are in short supply. Besides, trying to explain what\u2019s funny about something is the surest way to kill it.\n\n\u2022 Trying is the first step towards failure: 30 great one-liners\n\nPerversely perhaps, it\u2019s the humourlessness of Dostoevsky\u2019s characters, such as the truculent Alexei Ivanovich and the passionately progressive Ivan Matveeitch, that makes them so funny (to me, anyway), and renders their puny battles with society so laughable. Even if his writing doesn\u2019t tickle you, spending time with some of Dostoevsky\u2019s spiteful solipsists will at the very least provide an unnerving insight into how we all sound when mouthing off to anyone who\u2019ll listen about why some comedy is frankly unacceptable or unfunny. As the hero in Dostoevsky\u2019s The Dream of a Ridiculous Man complains to the world, capturing the angry sadness of the morally certain, and the daily difficulty we all experience when talking to people who disagree with us on matters of taste: \u201cOh, how hard it is when you\u2019re the only one who knows the truth!\u201d\n\nThe Crocodile is at the Manchester International Festival until July 18",

        "text": "The United Nations is selecting a new Secretary General this fall. TIME foreign affairs columnist Ian Bremmer spoke with Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, about how she would change the UN:\n\nWhat is the single most important thing that a UN Secretary General can do to make the United Nations a more effective institution?\n\nDeepen the trust among Member States, and between Member States and the UN as an institution. The UN is tasked with many responsibilities, including engaging in active preventive diplomacy, running outstanding field operations, creating the context for ambitious multilateral achievements, and delivering on programs across the many focus areas that have been mandated by governments. None of these can be delivered without trust. In the lead up to the Paris Agreement, we used to say that our three priorities were trust, trust and trust. This is because as deeper trust was established and carefully built, new types of conversations became possible and the elusive common ground began to emerge and grow. My vision is of a United Nations that Member States and citizens everywhere fully trust to help the international community avoid war, to excel at seeding and keeping peace where it is needed, and to foster breakthrough agreements and partnerships that improve people\u2019s lives today and give them greater hope for the future.\n\nWhat aspect of the UN\u2019s work do you believe is in greatest need of reform?\n\nLast year, the UN supported Member States to reach three breakthrough multilateral agreements that, taken together, lead us towards a more secure and prosperous future for all. These have become known as \u201cAgenda 2030\u201d. As a consequence of its own success, the UN as an institution now needs to reorganize around the inspiring goals that these agreements established, and ensure that it has the resources and capacity to ensure they are delivered. Many suggestions have been made about the specific reforms that might be needed \u2013 for example, the appointment of a Deputy Secretary General who is exclusively focused on Sustainable Development, or the establishment of a Sustainable Development Board to oversee the UN\u2019s 27 development programs, funds and specialized agencies; ensuring that they all pull in the same direction. An early task for the next Secretary General will be to consider the merits of these suggestions and come to a view about what\u2019s needed. But what\u2019s clear is that, with the negotiating phase now behind us, the UN must step confidently forward into this new era, pull together much more closely and gear up for the on-the-ground delivery of Agenda 2030.\n\nYou\u2019ve written of the need for greater UN investment in \u201cearly-warning\u201d of potential conflicts. What are the most important tell-tale signs of impending violence, and how can the UN use these to prevent conflict?\n\nThere are many factors that are linked to the likelihood of conflict: demographic shifts, exposure to fluctuating global commodity prices, economic performance and levels of inequality, a State\u2019s human rights record, security of access to vital resources, and communities\u2019 vulnerability to natural shocks like drought \u2013 to name but a few. The ongoing build up of adverse factors \u2013 to use the analogy of fire \u2013 is like the build up of large stocks of biomass. While lightning will not necessarily strike this year or next, still the build up of that biomass creates an ever-present risk; just one spark can, at any moment, tip the whole situation into conflict. Early warning systems are there to monitor the overall build up of that biomass; it does not help us to track some tell-tale signs, but not others. Rather, the UN system, working very closely with regional organisations, must continually scan and analyze the full range of data available; always on the look-out for the build up of risk.\n\nThere are several ways in which the UN can use this information to prevent conflict. In the short term, the UN can engage in preventative diplomacy; supporting States to alleviate and de-escalate key risk factors, where it notes that these are building up. For example, where particular communities are facing increasing water insecurity, the UN might support the host country and its neighbors to reach a trans-boundary water sharing agreements that ensures people\u2019s immediate needs are met. In the longer term, there is much that the UN can do to prevent conflict too \u2013 for example, accompanying countries in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda to ensure that societies everywhere are more prosperous, resource secure and resilient to shocks.\n\nWhat is the most important obstacle to the effectiveness of the Security Council, and what you do to overcome this obstacle?\n\nThe Security Council is at its most effective when its 15 Members share a common perspective on an emerging situation and can rapidly agree on what they see as the necessary course of action. But as we all know, it is rarely that simple. Given the complexity of many of the threats to peace and security that we see playing out today, and the different worldviews that come together on the Council \u2013 is it any wonder that a consensus position often takes time to emerge? This is not to excuse inaction \u2013 we are all shamed by the suffering we see in our world today and must do more to ensure people everywhere are safe and that their human rights are being honored. It is easy to say that there is no simple, quick solution to improving the effectiveness of the Security Council \u2013 but there are things that the Secretary-General can do. I would work tirelessly to ensure that many issues never need come before the Security Council \u2013 raising emerging threats early and lending my good offices to resolve a dispute before it becomes a conflict. Should this fail, I would not hesitate to bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in my opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. While the Security Council deliberated on the matter and what must be done, I would act as a trusted, impartial go-between for the various members, listening to their perspectives and giving 100% to building bridges between them in service of a swift and effective response.\n\nNo institution can be all things to all people. What things do you believe the UN should avoid trying to do?\n\nI believe the UN needs to act as a locus for agreement and as a catalyst for action; creating a favourable context for agreement among Member States, and mobilising a wide range of actors to deliver those agreements. While the UN system can and must align itself to help them deliver, it should not bear the full weight of delivery alone. The private sector, investors, civil society and many other stakeholders are very able to play their part; often having better access to capital flows and delivery infrastructure, including supply chains, than the UN. This approach is what I refer to as the new \u201ccollaborative diplomacy\u201d; inviting the contribution of others and blending the best of governmental and non-government \u2013 recognizing that more can be achieved through the collaboration of all.\n\nWhat specifically would you do as Secretary-General to help women and girls around the world to achieve their human potential?\n\nWomen\u2019s rights would be a key focus of my work as SG, and I would make this an overarching issue for all UN bodies to give special attention to. There have been some areas of improvement in women\u2019s rights globally in recent years, but overall progress has been limited, and significant inequalities and injustices based on gender persist globally. This is both unforgivable and a loss for all of us (not just women), as we all miss out when over 50% of the human population is not supported to achieve its full potential. Evidence shows, for example, that improving gender equality in all sectors can contribute to greater global peace and prosperity. There are many things that I would seek to do on this issue as SG. Firstly, I would strengthen the foundations upon which women\u2019s potential can flourish by promoting wider and stronger adherence to the UN Declaration on Human Rights and by implementing the 2030 Agenda \u2013 many aspects of which are relevant to women in particular. And secondly, I would make a concerted push on particular issues, including: providing greater aid to displaced women across the world (the vast majority of refugees and displaced people are women) \u2013 and putting additional safeguards in place to prevent them from being abused, and involving women in political negotiations and peacekeeping efforts.",

The nicknames, claimed by fans of the rap duo Insane Clown Posse, come from the group\u2019s 1992 track \u201cThe Juggla.\u201d\n\nAfter arriving, many of the Juggalos paint their faces with heavy clown makeup, indulge in drugs and alcohol, attend concerts of Insane Clown Posse acolytes and hop on amusement park rides. The retreat started at 7 a.m. on Wednesday and will end Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a psycho-porn theme park,\u201d says Camille Dodero, a journalist who attended four consecutive gatherings starting in 2010 and is attending this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an intense sensory overload.\u201d\n\nThe number 17 holds an important place in the iconography of Insane Clown Posse, which has elevated the significance of this year\u2019s event. But news outlets and online gawkers have been gobbling up the spectacle for years, especially since since the release of \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d a short, lewd independent documentary from 2011 that captured the scene before much of the mainstream came calling.\n\n\u201cI saw that movie a hundred times,\u201d Mr. Perkins said. \u201cI showed my friends that movie to enlighten them on Juggalos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d introduced many people to the humans behind the movement for the first time.\n\nThe documentary also helped to defang the image of the Juggalos, described by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in February 2011 as a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d but now widely regarded as a tribe of mostly harmless outcasts.\n\nThe director of \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d Sean Dunne, 35, a filmmaker who grew up in the suburbs of New York City, said that he was inspired to make the movie in 2010 after Tila Tequila, a Myspace celebrity who performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos that year, was pelted with rocks and beer bottles before being chased from the stage to her trailer.\n\n\u201cI remember sitting around and thinking that there was no way they could be that bad,\u201d Mr. Dunne said of the Juggalos. \u201cAnd I went to the gathering, and they really weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Dunne\u2019s film barely mentions Insane Clown Posse itself. It ignores the concerts and carnival events of the gathering. Instead, it features more than a dozen interviews with Juggalos enjoying each other\u2019s company, many of them ingesting drugs or alcohol, and several of them at least partly nude.\n\nThe documentary also features a Juggalette nicknamed Maniac who claims to be sober, though Mr. Dunne clarifies: \u201cJuggalo sober is a little different from what we would think of as sober.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuggalo sober is like, you only had 10 beers, smoked some weed and did a little molly,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr. Dunne\u2019s film shows Juggalos at their most hedonic, it is often a sympathetic portrayal, showing his interview subjects to be friendly, tolerant and inclusive. In \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d the festival resembles what it is often promoted as by its attendees: an enormous family reunion.\n\nSince it was posted to the video-sharing service Vimeo in September 2011, \u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d has been viewed more than 2 million times. Sam Morrill, a lead curator for the website, called the documentary \u201cone of the most provocative and celebrated films\u201d on Vimeo.\n\nNot all Juggalos appreciate the film\u2019s influence. Jason Shaltz, a photographer who has been a fan of Insane Clown posse since the mid-90s, will celebrate his 36th birthday at the Gathering of the Juggalos on Thursday. He said that while he admires Mr. Dunne\u2019s talent, \u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d chose to turn the cameras away from Insane Clown Posse and the other musical artists at the festival, the central element that draws the Juggalos together every year.\n\n\u201cI think it catapulted into the public eye because of the freak show aspect of it,\u201d Mr. Shaltz said. \u201cPeople like to watch train wrecks.\u201d\n\nMr. Perkins, who moonlights as a rapper himself, disagrees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the story \u2014 we make up the community,\u201d he said of the Juggalos. \u201cI know people who go to the gathering that are deaf. That are blind.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the year after the film was released, the media presence at the event, as well as the percentage of non-Juggalos in attendance, increased. Several outlets made films similar to Mr. Dunne\u2019s and many others featured articles and slide shows that took a mocking tone toward the group.\n\n\u201cOnce the Gathering of the Juggalos wasn\u2019t something to fear, people started going as an extreme adventure,\u201d Ms. Dodero said.\n\nOnce the general public catches wind of a music festival, the event is often lamented as having changed for the worse. This summer, The Times\u2019s music critics said that they would not cover the more mainstream events Coachella and Bonnaroo, writing that many festivals \u201clook increasingly alike in their vision of a codified, consensual, safe and purchasable bohemia.\u201d\n\nBut the Gathering of the Juggalos has remained outside the mainstream, fans say, and has not changed with the influx of tourists looking for a thrill. If anything, attendees say, the Juggalos have a way of converting the newcomers.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like it when jerky hipsters come in,\u201d Ms. Dodero said. \u201cBut even then, I\u2019ve seen the biggest jerky hipster be transformed within 12 hours, saying, \u2018These are the best people ever.\u2019\u201d",

He met Monday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nMr. Steinmeier said both Russia and Ukraine should step back from a looming confrontation along their de facto border on the Crimean peninsula, where Russia said two of its soldiers died in a skirmish with a Ukrainian commando group that had slipped across. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014.\n\nThe foreign minister of Russia, Sergey V. Lavrov, talked about the country's intention to use diplomacy to reduce tensions with Ukraine.\n\nWhether any such skirmish took place remains a matter of dispute. Ukraine has denied it, and says the Kremlin invented the story to escalate tensions and to whip up nationalist passions before parliamentary elections next month.\n\nA Russian television report documenting the arrest of a couple of Ukrainian commandos included shots of a full moon at dusk, though the moon was waning on the date of the alleged incident. While that raised suspicions, the shot may have been stock footage, intended to convey a nighttime atmosphere in Crimea and not tied to the specific date of the episode.\n\nRussian security services have also released a video of a detained man, Yevgeny Panov, said to have led the raid. Olga Kovitidi, a Russian senator, emphasized in comments reported by the Russian news media that Mr. Panov is a driver at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the closest such facility to the war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts said the commentary was one of the first significant instances of Russia raising the prospect of instability affecting the nuclear industry in Ukraine, with dark echoes of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Ukraine operates four civilian power plants with 15 reactors, and several research institutes hold radioactive materials.\n\nDuring the meeting on Monday, Mr. Lavrov said Russia was ready to supply additional evidence proving the Ukrainian incursion into Crimea.\n\nOn Monday, Vedomosti, a Russian newspaper, reported that Moscow might respond by unleashing rebel forces in eastern Ukraine. The authorities, the report said, are considering \u201cceasing to hold back the actions of the army of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d the main Russian-backed rebel group, which has threatened to attack across the line of control in eastern Ukraine in response to shelling from government positions into populated areas.\n\nMr. Steinmeier pressed Mr. Lavrov to abide by the battered and now nearly two-year-old truce between Russian-backed rebels and the Ukrainian government, known as the Minsk agreement.\n\nStriking a conciliatory note, Mr. Lavrov said Russia intended to continue diplomatic relations with Ukraine in spite of earlier comments that they might be broken off over the skirmish in Crimea, but said a final decision rested with President Vladimir V. Putin.",

        "text": "I visited Saudi Arabia in September 2008, arriving in Riyadh the day Hurricane Ike smashed into Houston, knocking out power for my wife and two little boys. Nothing I could do about it but watch storm footage on CNN International while drinking non-alcoholic Budweiser (no booze in the kingdom) and listening to the sounds of the muzzein calling Muslims to worship at the mosque behind the Marriott.\n\nThat was the same month that the financial crisis hit, and on the day of Lehman Brothers' ( LEHMQ - news - people ) collapse I spent the evening with billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal at his camp in the desert outside of Riyadh. We sat in the open air, under a starry sky, on an expanse of Persian rugs that must have taken up a quarter-acre. He was attended by a cadre of Bedouin servants who wore little pistols in their belts and continually refilled our little china cups with strong yellow Arabian coffee. A news junkie, the prince had three mega-screen TVs set up across the island of rugs from us. The biggest one in the middle was tuned to CNBC. The others showed pilgrims in Mecca walking around the Kaaba. It was the holy month of Ramadan. As we watched coverage of the financial collapse, Al-Waleed had the awesome idea of text-messaging CNBC's Maria Bartaromo his thoughts on Lehman. I think he was doing it mostly to show off that he had Maria's number in his phone, and I was impressed when she responded to his text 10 minutes later and asked him to be on her show the next day.\n\nLater in the evening I watched in disbelief as a line of about 500 Saudi men formed in the darkness, and one by one the men came forward to pay homage to the prince and ask him for some form of charity (money for a car, tuition, dowry, debts, etc). Several young men recited poems to the prince, who all the while continued to watch TV or check his phone. He holds court like this every week, giving away millions in patronage each year. The prince spends a lot of time in the desert and says he doesn't go to sleep until he sees the sky begin to brighten with dawn.\n\nA couple days later I found myself in the desert again, this time in the white-leather backseat of a 10-year-old Crown Victoria being driven the four hours from Riyadh to Damman, where I was to tour the headquarters of oil company Saudi Aramco. During Ramadan Saudis are barred from eating or drinking anything from sunup to sundown. But there was no prohibition on rock and roll; the driver, without comment, popped a cassette tape of Aerosmith's greatest hits into the stereo, and we screamed over the pristine blacktop at 90 miles an hour. Finally, when the red ball dipped under the desert horizon, my driver pulled into a truckstop (which, other than oilfield flares and a few camels, was the only sign of life in the desert) and bought us some snacks and water. I had been abstaining from food during the day as well, in part to see how the Saudis did it, and also because there was none for sale until nightfall. A few minutes later the driver pulled off the road to pray. I sat in the parked car and ate the most delicious bag of chips ever, all the while marveling that Aerosmith's \"Crazy\" was a much better song than I ever remembered. The full moon rose orange.\n\nRead more \"glimpses\" in our On The Road special report.",

        "text": "Dear TW: There are serious numerical anomalies in the debate you are moderating.You may want to check it out.\n\nI will state no opinion on who should or should not, will or will not become President of Mexico in four weeks\u00b4 time.\n\nI will nevertheless tell you that there is ample evidence to point out that the vote in this debate has been tampered with.\n\nI am sorry and certainly I believe the political operative who quite possibly has been behind this vote-rigging has to be at least privately reprimanded by his party;The Economist\u00b4s staff may want to do a quick investigation with the ample means at their disposal and should they conclude that enough evidence supports the proposition that this shameful event has taken place, a disclaimer on the debate should be added.Pulling this under the rug would be quite counter-productive.\n\nTo many people the world over, myself included, this newspaper is an institution worth preserving.Numbers, facts and balanced, insightful analysis are the reasons we have trusted The Economist for decades. It is totally unacceptable for anyone to tarnish its reputation by using old Mexican small-town vote-rigging tactics either to get back at Mrs Josefina Vazquez\u00b4s use of The Economist at the first televised presidential debate against Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or as a propaganda tool in the next debate.\n\nLet\u00b4s see the numbers.For those unfamiliar with Mexico\u00b4s presidential election to be held July 1, 2012,there are four candidates.One of them, from the teacher\u00b4s union, has never polled above 5%.The ones with real chances are Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto from PRI, who polled formerly as high as 42% and now in the low 30s; Mrs.Josefina Vazquez, from the ruling center-right PAN,now in third and formerly in second place, polling in the high 20s, and Mr. AMLO from the center-left PRD, now in second place, polling in the low 30s but behind Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Some polls speak of a four point spread between the two, others point to a ten point spread.\n\nBut the essence of the matter is that all parties as well as the voters they represent are united in this: they are all against PRI and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto ever claiming back the presidency they lost in the year 2000.Thus if Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto has 34% or 42 % of the votes, by definition that means that either 66% or 58% of all voters are opposed to the proposition that \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your poll shows 30% of the people opposing your motion instead of the 60-70% indicated by all polls conducted in Mexico is a first sign of trouble.Only the staff at The Economist knows how many votes have originated outside Mexico.If the numbers do not change much once these non-Mexico originated votes have been removed, the idea of vote manipulation gathers strength.\n\nNow, the people most likely to read this newspaper in Mexico, and thus vote in your debate, are naturally highly educated professionals.But you see, the latest poll gruporeforma.blogs.com/encuestas confirms the well-known fact that this demographic is overwhelmingly against the PRI, and has been so for at least 20 years, if not more.The affluent and well-educated are mostly PRD and to a certain extend PAN.In Mexico City, for example, PRD has a twenty-point lead.The actual numbers nationwide are:For voters with only primary education PRI 41%,PRD 30%, PAN 25%.For voters with college education:PRI 28%, PRD 43%, PAN 21%.Therefore, among the people most likely to read TE less than 30% would agree with your proposition, yet your numbers show just the opposite result.\n\nOr do they? Well, actually the opinions stated in your 116 Opening Comments,50 Rebuttal Comments, 541 Opening Recommendations and 286 Rebuttal Recommendations if carefully tabulated and analyzed are totally supportive of those rough numbers of 70% of voter\u00b4s negating PRI\u00b4s returning to the Presidency and below 30% believing \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your comments are in statistical agreement with the numbers we would expect from a multitude of polls, while your poll debate numbers are so divergent as to be mirror images of the former is a clear indication of voter fraud.\n\nIf we read carefully the 116 Opening Comments we see only 105 are real comments, since people sometimes mistakenly click on to post before they have actually written any comment.About 10% of these 105 indicate no decision on the debate\u00b4s proposition, but rather speak of various tangential matters such as the convenience for non-Mexicans to abstain from voting(the opinion of that gentleman who wisely retired to sunny Portugal,SaintMartinian),or to buy beach-front property(YukonDave),teachers saying they will use the debate in their classroom...and a funny Mexican who thinks his country would be better served if it were a colony of Sweden or The Netherlands(recommended by 3)...or another one who says Mexico would have been better off if it had not declared independence from Spain.",

        "text": "Castao, who leads the Colombian paramilitaries, known by their Spanish acronym AUC, the largest right-wing paramilitary force to ever exist in the western hemisphere reveals that he was trained in the arts of war in Israelas a young man of 18 in the 1980s.\n\nHe glowingly adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI copied the concept of paramilitary forces from the Israelis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his chapter-long account of his Israel experiences.\n\nCastao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-wing Phalange-like AUC force is now by far the worst human rights violator in all of the Americas, and ties between that organisation and Israel are continually surfacing in the press.\n\nThe AUC paramilitaries are a fighting force that originally grew out of killers hired to protect drug-running operations and large landowners. They were organised into a cohesive force by Castao in 1997. It exists outside the law but often coordinates its actions with the Colombian military, in a way similar to the relationship of the Lebanese Phalange to the Israeli army throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAccording to a 1989 Colombian Secret Police intelligence report, apart from training Carlos Castao in 1983, Israeli trainers arrived in Colombia in 1987 to train him and other paramilitaries who would later make up the AUC.\n\nFifty of the paramilitaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest\u00e2\u0080\u009d students were then sent on scholarships to Israel for further training according to a Colombian police intelligence report, and the AUC became the most prominent paramilitary force in the hemisphere, with some 10,000-12,000 men in arms.\n\nThe Colombian AUC paramilitaries are always in need of arms, and it should come as no surprise that some of their major suppliers are Israeli. Israeli arms dealers have long had a presence in next-door Panama and especially in Guatemala.\n\nIn May of last year, GIRSA, an Israeli company associated with the Israeli Defence Forces and based in Guatemala was able to buy 3000 Kalashnikov assault rifles and 2.5 million rounds of ammunition that were then handed over to AUC paramilitaries in Colombia.\n\nIsrael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military relations with right-wing groups and regimes spans Latin America from Mexico to the southernmost tip of Chile, starting just a few years after the Israeli state came into existence.\n\nSince then, the list of countries Israel has supplied, trained and advised includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela.\n\nBut it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only the sales of planes, guns and weapons system deals that characterises the Israeli presence in Latin America.\n\nWhere Israel has excelled is in advising, training and running intelligence and counter-insurgency operations in the Latin American \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty war\u00e2\u0080\u009d civil conflicts of Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and now Colombia.\n\nIn the case of the Salvadoran conflict - a civil war between the right-wing landowning class supported by a particularly violent military pitted against left-wing popular organisations - the Israelis were present from the beginning. Besides arms sales, they helped train ANSESAL, the secret police who were later to form the framework of the infamous death squads that would kill tens of thousands of mostly civilian activists.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, 83% of El Salvador's military imports came from Israel, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. By 1981, many of those in the civilian popular political movements who had survived the death squads headed for the hills to become guerrillas.\n\nBy 1981 there was an open civil war in El Salvador which took over a decade to resolve through negotiations.\n\nEven though the US was openly backing the Salvadoran Army by 1981, as late as November 1983 it was asking for more Israeli \u00e2\u0080\u009cpractical assistance\u00e2\u0080\u009d there, according to a declassified secret document obtained recently by Aljazeera.\n\nAmong the assistance asked for were helicopters, trucks, rifles, ammunition, and combat infantry advisors to work at both the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompany and battalion level of the Salvadoran Army\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nOne notable Salvadoran officer trained by the Israelis was Major Roberto D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubuisson, who always held a high opinion of the Israelis. It was Major D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubuisson who ordered the assassination of El Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s archbishop amongst thousands of other murders.\n\nLater he would organise the right-wing National Republican Alliance Party (ARENA) and send his son to study abroad in the relative safety of Israel.\n\nAmazingly, while the Israelis were training the El Salvadoran death squads they were also supporting the anti-semitic Argentine military government of the late 1970s and early 1980s - at a time when that government was involvedin another \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty war\u00e2\u0080\u009d of death squads and disappearances.\n\nIn 1978, Nicaragua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dictator Somoza was making his last stand against a general uprising of the Sandinista-led population who were sick of his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynasty which had ruled and monopolised the county for half a century. The Israelis and the US had been supplying Somoza with weapons for years. But when President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1976 he ordered a cessation of all US military assistance to Nicaragua.\n\nIsrael utilised Carter's humanrights policy to its advantage\n\nFilling the void, the Israelis immediately increased their weapons supplies to Somoza until he fled the country when the Sandinistas took power.\n\nIsraeli operatives then helped train right-wing Nicaraguan Contras in Honduran and Costa Rican camps to fight the Sandinista government, according to Colombian police intelligence reports Aljazeerahas obtained.\n\nAt least some of the same Israeli operatives had also previously trained the nucleus of the paramilitary organisations that would become the AUC in Colombia.\n\nBut by far the bloodiest case of Israeli involvement in Latin America was its involvement in Guatemala from the 1970s to the 1990s. As in El Salvador, a civil war pitted a populist but, in this case, mainly Indian left against a mainly European oligarchy protected by a brutal Mestizo Army.\n\nAs Guatemalan President Carlos Arana said in 1971, \"If it is necessary to turn the country into a cemetery in order to pacify it, I will not hesitate to do so.\"\n\nThe Israelis supplied Guatemala with Galil rifles, and built an ammunition factory for them, as well as supplying armoured personnel carriers and Arava planes. Behind the scenes, they were actively involved in the bloodiest counter-insurgency campaign the hemisphere has known since the European conquest, in which at least 200,000 (mostly Indians) were killed.\n\nLike Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original occupation of Palestine, several entire Guatemalan Indian villages were razed and a million people displaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe guerrilla is the fish. The people are the sea. If you cannot catch the fish, you have to drain the sea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Guatemalan President Rios Montt in 1982.\n\nIsraeli arms and training fuelledGuatemalan unrest\n\nGuatemalan army officers credit Israeli support with turning the tide against the uprising, not only in the countryside where Israeli counter-insurgency techniques and assistance set up strategic-hamlet-like \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevelopment poles\u00e2\u0080\u009d along the lines of the Israeli kibbutz, but also in the cities where \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsraeli communication technicians and instructors\u00e2\u0080\u009d working through then-sophisticated computers were able to locate and then decimate guerrillas and their supporters in Guatemala City in 1981.\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the 1990s, the US could not overtly support the Guatemalan army because of its horrendous human rights record (although there was some covert support), but many in the US government, especially in the CIA, supported Israel in taking up the slack.\n\nBut the US grew to regret its actions. On 10 March 1999, US President Bill Clinton issued an apology for US involvement in the war: The \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnited States... support for military forces or intelligence units which engaged in violent and widespread repression...was wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No similar statement has ever been forthcoming from the Israelis.\n\nAt the present time, the only major insurgency war in Latin America is in Colombia, where Israel has an overt involvement.\n\nBesides the dozen or so Kfir IAI C-7 jet fighters they have sold the Colombian government, and the Galil rifles produced in Bogota under licence, most of the Israeli ties to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counter-insurgency war are closely-guarded secrets.\n\nAljazeera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to obtain clarification on these and other issues for this story were stonewalled by the Israeli embassy in Washington.\n\nWhy does Israel continue to provide arms and expertise to the pariahs of the world? Clearly, part of the reason is the revenues produced by arms sales, and part of it has do with keeping up with trends in counter-insurgent war across the globe.\n\nBut another factor is what is demanded of Israel by the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only superpower, the US, in partial exchange for the superpower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued support for Israeli dominance in the Middle East.\n\nThis relationship can be best illustrated by recently declassified 1983 US government documents obtained by the Washington, DC-based National Security Archives through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nOne such declassified document is a 1983 memo from the notorious Colonel Oliver North of the Reagan Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Council and reads: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs discussed with you yesterday, I asked CIA, Defense, and State to suggest practical assistance which the Israelis might offer in Guatemala and El Salvador.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother document, this time a 1983 cable from the US Ambassador in Guatemala to Washington Frederic Chapin shows the money trail.\n\nHe says that at a time when the US did not want to be seen directly assisting Guatemala, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have reason to believe that our good friends the Israelis are prepared, or already have, offered substantial amounts of military equipment to the GOG (Government of Guatemala) on credit terms up to 20 years...(I pass over the importance of making huge concessionary loans to Israel so that it can make term loans in our own backyard).\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn other words, during civil wars in which the US does not want to be seen getting its hands dirty in Latin America, the superpower loans Israel money at a very good rate, and then Israel uses these funds to do the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty work\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In this regard, in Latin America at least, Israel has become the hit-man for the US.",

        "text": "A detail from Saying Farewell at Xunyang, by Qiu Ying, c1500-50 Photograph: John Lamberton/Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art\n\nOn 5 August 1473, a young artist drew the first ever landscape. The date is known precisely because Leonardo da Vinci wrote it on the sheet of paper, as if aware of the revolutionary nature of what he was doing. To look at mountains and trees just for themselves was unprecedented.\n\nOr was it? The invention of landscape painting is one of the great moments of European art. Painting nature is a way to get inside yourself. To this day, people enjoy doing watercolours in the outdoors as a form of meditation. Leonardo's discovery of the mystery of nature \u2013 which you see in all his paintings, with their dreamy rocks and pools \u2013 is the invention of a new kind of inner life.\n\nYet it is a lot less original than we might like to think. There is an uncanny likeness between Leonardo's rocks, trees and rivers and the rocks, trees and rivers that Chinese artists were painting centuries before he was born. It is bizarre: that 1473 drawing actually looks like a reworking of classic Chinese paintings such as Li Gongnian's Winter Evening Landscape. When was that painted? I look at the label in the V&A's new exhibition Masterpieces of Chinese Painting. It says 1120. That's 353 years before the very similar sketch by Leonardo.\n\nIt is conventional, nowadays, to pay lip service to the fact that many versions of art exist, that beautiful art comes from all over the world and every way of life. Yet the story of art that most of us absorb \u2013 as told in The Story of Art by EH Gombrich, first published in 1950 and still the definitive account of art's progress \u2013 puts European innovation at the centre of the action. All peoples make art, but the west takes it forward.\n\nMasterpieces of Chinese Painting is the most devastating refutation of such assumptions I have ever seen. It shows that during the Song dynasty, at a time when Europeans were fighting barbaric crusades and had long forgotten the creativity that flourished in ancient Greece, artists in China were taking painting to heights of sensitivity and poetry that would not be attained elsewhere until the ages of Leonardo \u2013 or for that matter, when you look at the most radical Chinese touches, Van Gogh.\n\nI'd go further. Looking at this show being installed and talking to its curator Zhang Hongxing, I can't resist airing the theory that Leonardo stole the idea of landscape painting from China. Could he somehow have seen Chinese paintings? Might something have reached the west along the Silk Road? Excitedly, I get Leonardo's 1473 drawing up on my iPad and hold it among the 12th-century Chinese landscapes for comparison. The shapes of the hills and trees in Leonardo's sketch perfectly mirror the sugar-loaf peaks and willowy trees in 900-year-old Chinese paintings.\n\nZhang's well aware of this idea: it was raised very seriously in the 1950s, he says, but there is no proof. It's a mystery. Nor is Leonardo the only European pioneer of landscape who looks \"Chinese\". Zhang points out that Pieter Bruegel the Elder is also very \"Chinese\" looking. This is true. Bruegel's much-loved Hunters in the Snow has all the elements that delighted medieval Chinese landscape painters, including all that snow.\n\nBut why did China invent landscape art in the first place? Why did artists begin to depict, not gods and battles as elsewhere, but the grandeur of nature? It has something to do with Buddhism, which spread to China before AD1,000 and inspired a culture of contemplation. It also has to do with the technical achievements of the Song era. The scientific mind that perfected porcelain also looked at nature with a new clarity.\n\nOne of the first things you see in the show was actually painted by a Song emperor \u2013 though it comes with a warning to rulers, for Emperor Huizong's dreamy fascination with art helped to lose him his throne. Indeed, as the curator explains, painting in China has always been associated with retreat and escapism. Not all the works in this exhibition are landscapes. There are pictures of courtesans and the tremendous Nine Dragons, a dazzling mythic vision painted by Chen Rong in 1244. Yet for me, the escapist pursuit of pastoral in China's pioneering landscapes is utterly beguiling. After the Mongols conquered China there was a clear association of art with the rejection of power. Turning their backs on the court, intellectuals created gardens, wrote poetry and painted expressive scenes of wintry trees. They rendered nature in a free, subjective style that anticipated \u2013 and of course, influenced \u2013 Van Gogh.\n\nPersonally, I am convinced that Leonardo must have got access to the art of China. He was fascinated by the east and once applied for a job in Istanbul, offering to serve the Ottoman empire and praising Allah in a letter that survives. Did all this interest in Asia lead him to some hushed library where he unrolled a silk scroll and saw mountains, cherry blossoms and water?\n\nOne thing is certain. Zhang's great exhibition turns the story of art upside down.",

        "text": "When the dust settles on this year of spectacle and recession-proof Olympic construction, of teetering steel pointing to the sky, of swinging cranes, mayoral openings and breathless press releases, of the mighty Shard and the risible Orbit, one of the most memorable works will turn out to be something invisible above ground, and largely the creation of little-known 1950s engineers. This is the conversion of the oil tanks of the former Bankside power station in London \u2013 a clover of three buried concrete cylinders \u2013 into new spaces for performance and exhibition for Tate Modern, which is what the power station became in 2000.\n\nThis project is by the Basel-based firm of Herzog & de Meuron, architects of that icon of icons, the stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics \u2013 or Bird's Nest, as the architects don't like it to be called. The stadium set out to be a modern Eiffel Tower and succeeded, impressing its image on global television audiences of billions: of all the attention-seeking buildings of recent years, it commanded as much attention as any.\n\nThe Tanks at Tate Modern are a work of uncovering as much as addition, and finding rather than making, and there is not much chance that they will imprint their image on the world's imagination. You may indeed not be overwhelmingly excited by the photographs on this page, as the Tanks are hard to capture with a lens. They are voids rather than objects, things to be experienced rather than seen.\n\nThey are not, however, exactly modest. Each has a height of 7 metres and a diameter of 30 metres. Built to hold the fuel that powered the turbines that generated electricity for a large chunk of the capital, and to withstand the risk of explosion, they are thick-walled and capacious, a trefoil of inside-out towers, or a castle in negative.\n\nThey have the confident geometry of things made not for appearance but for a substantial practical use, and their concrete surfaces have a raw force. They are impressive just for being there, and the architects' approach has been largely to let their size and mass speak for themselves.\n\nOne cylinder has been made into a performance space, another into a room for temporary installations with a preference for those using moving images. The third tank has been subdivided into the functions, such as dressing rooms, needed to serve the other two. Floors, ceiling and lighting have been added as necessary to fulfil their new tasks. On the approach to the Tanks you see an archaeology of patches and slatherings of concrete, marks of the changes and repairs made to the structure over the years.\n\nUnless you are a connoisseur of concrete techniques during the second Elizabethan era, you don't greatly distinguish between the changes made this year and those of a half-century ago. As in Astley Castle in Warwickshire, you're presented with a composite of past and present, where the joins between the two are not strongly marked. For an architect on such projects, according to Pierre de Meuron, \"it is mostly good advice to disappear, as you leave your traces anyway. It looks as if it has been so forever but it was actually different before.\" The urge to dramatise what is already impressive has been avoided.\n\nRooflights could have been added, such that daylight could have gushed into the Tanks and made them into romantic Piranesian ruins, but Jacques Herzog says this \"would have been a trap \u2013 it becomes kitsch if you make too much of it\". The way that he and de Meuron have designed it is to stress that \"it is really an underground space\". Each tank has \"a door and that's it. It's just very straightforward.\"\n\nThe effect of this approach is to flatten the experience of the Tanks, such that their scale grows on you rather than amazes you all at once.\n\nIt also allows them to function as background to the performances and installations they will hold, rather than be the star turn in themselves. They will only be completed by the things that will happen in them, which is as it should be. And if you want drama there is no shortage of it in the Turbine Hall next door, or in a multi-storey twisted brick pyramid that is about to rise over the Tanks.\n\nIt's tempting to see the fondness of digging and revealing as a sign of our less shiny times, and it can also be seen in the same architects' Serpentine Pavilion, and their plans for renovating the giant Park Avenue Armory in New York, but as the Tanks and the pyramid together will cost \u00a3215m, this new modesty would have to be taken at a purely symbolic level. It would be more accurate to see it as a continuation of the original idea of 1994, when it was first decided to make an old power station into the Tate's new gallery of modern art.\n\nThe plan was derided at the time, as a backward-looking, heritage-obsessed failure to take the opportunity to commission proud new buildings, but the success of the Turbine Hall showed that it can be as powerful to use and modify found spaces as make new ones. The Tanks, meanwhile, remained a great secret place, buried beneath the grass behind Tate Modern. It was a particular obsession of Tate's director Nick Serota (who liked, evidently, to park his tanks under the lawn) to bring them into use.\n\n\"I want those oil tanks,\" he told his architects, \"even if I don't know how to use them,\" and eventually art based on performance and moving images provided the reason, and Tate's genius for fundraising came up with the cash. And so an intriguing new republic has been added to Tate's imperium, or a new district to its city of art. Visitors will now have a reason to turn right after passing through Tate Modern's main entrance, where at the moment all the interest is on the left.\n\nThere is an obvious danger in pursuing space for its own sake, which is that whatever goes in it feels like a pretext, a token gesture embarrassed by its setting. There is also a danger that Tate's relentless expansion will bloat it, and make it in the end an exhausting barrage of over-spectacular presentations. With an exhibition area of 1,800 sq metres, the Tanks are more than half as big as the not-small Turbine Hall, and exceed the display space of entire regional galleries, such as the Turner Contemporary in Margate.\n\nBut at this point, not yet tested by use, the Tanks feel credible.\n\nThere seems to be a purpose to their intended programming with film and performance, and they are distinctive enough \u2013 exceptionally so \u2013 to be rather more than another dollop of space in the Tate's halls. In the end, these underground chambers are simply extraordinary places, of a kind that would not now be invented from scratch. It would have been a shocking not to make use of them.\n\nThe Tanks at Tate Modern, London SE1 open on 18 July with Art in Action, a 15-week festival of performance and installation art",

In both movies, Barrymore\u2019s cuteness was an effective counterbalance (or complement) to Sandler\u2019s hodgepodge of crass loopiness and underlying sincerity.\n\nThey\u2019re back together in \u201cBlended,\u201d as melancholy single parents whose families bond on an African vacation. Barrymore plays harried for a chunk of the story, reminding us that she\u2019s a mom in real life now, after all. But the movie could use a lot more of her familiar infectiousness. It\u2019s the glue that holds together Sandler\u2019s earnest moments and his penchant for scattershot tomfoolery.\n\nThe story opens with Sandler\u2019s Jim and Barrymore\u2019s Lauren on, yes, a first date \u2014 a disastrous rendezvous punctuated by peeved barbs and \u201cemergency\u201d calls from home giving them a quick out. It\u2019s soon clear why they\u2019re both off their dating game: Lauren has a couple of unruly boys and a smugly useless ex (Joel McHale), while widowed Jim tries hard with his three girls, but is better at teaching them basketball than at helping them navigate puberty.\n\nA contrived coincidence involving Lauren\u2019s brassy friend (Wendi McLendon-Covey) gives both Jim and Lauren the opportunity to jump on a family trip to Africa for cheap. The two are irked to meet again, but gradually, each fills a void in the other\u2019s brood. Lauren is great with lullabies, and rightly points out that Jim\u2019s oldest daughter (Bella Thorne) might prefer something girlier than the barbershop haircuts he gets her. (Uncomfortable tomboy jokes are only made odder by Thorne\u2019s resemblance to Keira Knightley.) Jim, meanwhile, knows just what Lauren\u2019s younger boy (Kyle Red Silverstein) needs: a father figure who actually cares. Enough, even, to join him in cartoonish craziness like ostrich riding.\n\n\u201cYou gotta show up for your kids,\u201d Jim tells Lauren in a likably sentimental bit of parental philosophizing. Of course, this being an Adam Sandler movie, he and director pal Frank Coraci (\u201cWedding Singer,\u201d \u201cClick\u201d) hedge their narrative bets by glopping on the anything-goes humor that fans expect.\n\nSome of it works. Sandler and Barrymore have some great interaction with Alyvia Alyn Lind, who plays Jim\u2019s youngest daughter with a very funny mouths-of-babes streak. But while a Greek chorus styled like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and led by preening Terry Crews is gleefully wacky, don\u2019t be surprised if the caricatured African setting draws some complaints. The location feels more like a random choice than a thematically relevant one, and at times it plays like an ad for South Africa\u2019s infamously segregated Sun City resort.\n\nFunny thing, though: The sunnier that Barrymore gets in her scenes with Sandler, the more the iffy elements and leaden bits seem to just melt away. Blend in more of that spirit, and their latest pairing might rate better.",

In those days intelligence tests, developed during World War I, were accepted as an infallible means of identifying the \u201chighly intelligent.\u201d\n\nHe called attention to the problem by denouncing higher education as more devastating to the human race than war.\n\nIn 1929 he said that the fu\u00adture would see a larger pro\u00adportion of Negroes in the North than in the South, a forecast that anticipated the movement of the Negro north but exag\u00adgerated its scope. He advanced evidence that Southern Negroes were able to adapt to the more rigorous climate of the north.\n\nMost of Dr. Holmes's chal\u00adlenging statements reflected the position of some of the pioneers of eugenics, who were unaware that large gaps existed in their knowledge.\n\nIn 1939, as president of the Western division of the Ameri\u00adcan Association for the Ad\u00advancement of Science, he urged the substitution of a Darwinian code of morals for the ancient Hebraic and Christian codes.\n\nThe Darwinian code, present\u00aded as an outgrowth of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, accepts cruelty, lust, deceit, cowardice and selfishness as in\u00adtrinsic \u201cvirtues\u201d but disapproves their abuse, he said.\n\nThis idea, not original withDr. Holmes, was developed into a social philosophy called \u201cso\u00adcial Darwinism,\u201d which had a certain vogue in Nazi Germany and other countries but which later fell into disrepute.\n\nThis public image tended to obscure the fact that he was one of the world's foremost au\u00adthorities on zoology and genetics, internationally known for his studies of animal hered\u00adity and behavior. He was one of the first scientists to recognize that radiation could create monsters.\n\nDr. Holmes was born in Henry, Ill. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in science at the University of California and his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Chicago in 1897. After a year of teaching in the public schools of California, Dr. Holmes was an instructor in zoology for six years at the University of Mich\u00adigan.\n\nHe then transferred to the University of Wisconsin, where he remained until 1912, when he went to California as an asso\u00adciate professor. He became pro\u00adfessor in 1917. Dr. Holmes taught at California, and also at the Marine Biological Labor\u00adatory at Wood's Hole, until his retirement in 1939.\n\nHe married Cecelia WarfieldSkinner in 1909.

Commissioned by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, the glowing swing set contains LED lights that activate based on the swings\u2019 movement. An internal accelerometer measures speeds, which signal the color changes.\n\nThe swing set is part of the MCCA\u2019s initiative to create the first interactive public space in Boston. \u201cWe wanted to have a piece that would entice anyone to use it, not just stop and stare,\u201d said Jim Rooney, executive director of the MCCA.\n\nPart playground implement, part art installation, \u201cSwing Time\u201d was designed by Eric Howeler and Meejin Yoon of the Boston firm Howeler and Yoon Architecture. The husband-and-wife team has designed several art pieces meant to activate public spaces, including the award-winning \u201cWhite Noise/White Light\u201d field at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.\n\nHoweler, also an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said he wanted to blend the ideas of a responsive environment and a play space to \u201cSwing Time,\u201d in order to entice park goers to physically interact with it.\n\n\u201cThe stuff between buildings is often left to happenstance, and one of the best ways to bring life to the public realm is through art pieces like this one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stop playing at a certain age.

The space hosts music events, and serves as a reception area for events at the BCEC.\n\nRooney hopes that the many organizations and visitors who make their way to the waterfront for conventions, family outings, and the like will take advantage of the Lawn, designated as an experimental event space. \u201cWe want the space to be reflective of the innovative people who live and visit Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd especially this new community that the park resides in\u201d \u2014 Boston\u2019s new innovation district.\n\nJustin Saglio for The Boston Globe\n\nAnna Kaertner at \u201cSwing Time.\u201d\n\nHoweler said he is happy that the MCCA sought to unite Boston\u2019s creative and technology cultures. \u201cBoston has the (Institute of Contemporary Art) and MIT and so many other institutions that are really shaping the world and the space within it in creative new ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such a historic city, but it also has this techy-geeky side that could visually shine through.\u201d\n\nBlending the Lawn\u2019s landscape and atmosphere into \u201cSwing Time\u201d was a pivotal design component, Howeler said.

What drew me to the campaign was really the opportunity to work for Barack Obama. I don\u2019t necessarily see this as a situation where I\u2019m going to be going through the revolving door, in and out of administrations. I happen to have found somebody who I really love to work for, who I have a really good relationship with, and it\u2019s hard to walk away from that.\n\nDo you ever feel envious of friends you started with, who\u2019re out now and setting their hours?\n\nAnybody who leaves here, you see them a couple months later and they look a lot better. They look 20 pounds lighter and five years younger. So it does give you some envy, because you see the physical toll the job takes on you. You see everybody moving, some in Washington, some out to California, and you realize there are many green pastures out there. I still come to work in a windowless office in the basement of the White House. But the other side of the coin is that there\u2019s no other job like this. When you walk out that door for the last time here, you realize your ability to be at the center of events and decision-making on momentous things that are changing the course of history, that goes away. It cuts both ways.\n\nYou had a choice when you entered public life between this and pursuing a career as an author. Is that still the plan when you leave?\n\nI had originally been looking at writing, including fiction. When I leave here, I would certainly want to do my own writing, but more in the non-fiction realm \u2014 books, long-form journalism, and related opportunities. So I haven\u2019t given it much thought beyond that. But after writing for somebody else for so many years, it will be interesting to pivot back to doing things in my own voice.\n\nWhat advice would you give to somebody who wants to follow your path, about the most relevant experience you had to land you this job?\n\nPeople make a mistake when they think that if you just accumulate a set number of things on your resume, it\u2019s going to lead you to a particular place \u2014 the pattern of essentially compiling credentials to climb your way up a ladder. That may work, but that\u2019s not at all what happened to me. I found people I really wanted to work for; I made myself available to do whatever I could with the skills I had; I took some risk, packing up and moving to Chicago; and I looked for the opportunities that fit for me. So I think the biggest advice is to find people you love to work for who you\u2019re going to learn from.\n\nYou and the President obviously spend a lot of time together. Do you have any travel rituals? What do you do on the plane?\n\nHe\u2019s a card player, I\u2019m not. But I\u2019ve gone on all of his foreign trips. We\u2019ll have very intense schedules. One ritual is he likes to find little pockets of down time in the day to just unwind, talk about other things, to be relaxed. But the one ritual that\u2019s always the case is that on speeches, he works very late, so he\u2019ll constantly be making line edits and fiddling with text up until the last minute. So you get a lot of late nights, especially on the big speeches. So you have to kind of pace yourself with the expectation you\u2019re not going to get a lot of sleep, that you\u2019ve got to find ways to relax over the course of the day and that you need to have a reserve of mental energy that you can draw from. That\u2019s the rhythm that you get into on these foreign trips that can be quite a grind.\n\nWhen you\u2019re actually in the White House, how long is your typical day? Can you characterize it?\n\nI\u2019ll get in around 8 and get an intelligence briefing at the beginning of the day, and then go into a series of morning meetings that are about figuring out what we need in place for that day. The afternoons tend to be meetings or work on what policies are running through a process, what are the next big things we\u2019re getting ready for, the next big trip, the next big speech, the next big rollout of a policy. And I\u2019ll tend to be at work from 8 to 8. But the thing about this job, it\u2019s not so much the hours in the office\u2014it\u2019s that you\u2019re always on call. So you\u2019ll end up having to answer email and do things up until you go to bed at 12 or 1 in the morning. So even when you\u2019re home, you\u2019re still working. That\u2019s particularly true in foreign policy. The other day, when we launched airstrikes in Syria, we obviously knew that was going to happen, but that happens overnight, so you basically end up being up all night. You don\u2019t get to control the timing of when things happen in foreign policy like you do in other areas. If something happens in North Korea, or the Middle East or Ukraine, you have to respond to it no matter what time of day it is. So it ends up making you essentially on call 24 hours a day.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important speech you\u2019ve worked on so far? I\u2019m wondering where the UN speech ranks.\n\nThe UN speech is definitely one of the most important, because it\u2019s intended to set the tone for the next year or so going forward, here in the United States but also globally. It\u2019s the roadmap for we\u2019re doing, where we\u2019re trying to go, what we expect of others. There have been a handful of speeches like that. The Cairo speech in 2009, in some ways the Nobel speech he gave, which in some ways was a window into his view of the world that endures well. They break through in a way because they\u2019re bigger than the precise moment we\u2019re in. They\u2019re about laying down markers for what\u2019s going to define the U.S. role in the world for a period of time to come.\n\nBen Rhodes, left with President Obama and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough on Air Force OnePhoto: Pete Souza\u2014The White House/Getty Images\n\nDid you revisit the Cairo and Nobel speeches in writing this one? How\u2019d they inform it?\n\nI actually find the two things I always try to do before working on a big speech are to go back and read relevant speeches by President Obama and by other presidents. It\u2019s interesting to see how other presidents deal with similar moments in time. How did other Presidents speak at the UN at times of significant international turmoil or the beginning of a military action? For President Obama, I often try to go back and look at the foundational speeches. So, what did we say at the UN in previous years? What\u2019s in Cairo speech, what\u2019s in the Nobel speech, even going back to the campaign. And you try to find a thread you can pull forward and update. Even sometimes there\u2019s specific language that you seek to use again to make sure there\u2019s a thread of consistency to the message.\n\nAre there speeches by other presidents you referenced specifically for his latest UN address?\n\nI looked at the 1961 speech to the General Assembly by John F. Kennedy, and I actually ended up putting a quote from that speech in this one. There, too, the theme was essentially a world at a crossroads and having to make a choice between different paths. And so that ended up impacting how we framed this speech. We looked at others, too, and it\u2019s interesting to see how different presidents make use of that particular world stage.\n\nLooking past the current military campaign, how hopeful are you about a lasting peace, in whatever way you want to define that, presiding in the Middle East in the mid- to long-term? Some people are seeing nothing less than a civilizational collapse that\u2019s not fixable in our lifetimes.\n\nThe reason I have to optimistic is that it\u2019s the one thing everybody in the region seems to agree on\u2013that this is such a shocking organization that it\u2019s stirred people out of complacency and opened the doors to alliances that weren\u2019t previously possible. We had the Iraqi prime minister in a meeting with the five Arab nations in our coalition, who have Sunni-led governments. That would not have been thinkable even six months ago. If everybody maintains the current sense of urgency, you can see a pathway for this group to be steadily eroded, but also something better taking its place in terms of a new approach to regional stability. And the other thing I\u2019d say is we can fall into a trap of making these groups and threats out to be more resilient than they really are. With Al Qaeda, we\u2019ve shown that if we just keep the pressure on and have a consensus against an organization, the organization in Afghanistan and Pakistan for intents and purposes is at best a shadow of its former self. The challenge is now doing that in the heart of the Middle East with this group and other extremist satellite. But part of the reason the President gave the speech that he gave is to make clear this can\u2019t just be us launching a bunch of airstrikes. This has to be a much broader effort.\n\nMost of our readers would agree with the assessment behind the rebalance to Asia, that economically the center of gravity in the world is shifting there. It also seems unavoidable with ISIS, and Israel, and Ukraine, and Ebola, that your focus is directed elsewhere right now. How do you deal with that?\n\nYou have to be very disciplined to make sure that even as you\u2019re working the urgent issues, you\u2019re not neglecting what I\u2019d say are the opportunity pieces of your agenda. And the rebalance to Asia is certainly part of that. So for instance, when I went up to the UN with the President, even as we had to work on the speech and all the elements of the coalition building, I carved out two hours for a meeting with the presidential advisor from Burma to talk about the President\u2019s upcoming trip there. It would have been easier to just scrap something like that and focus on ISIL. But you have to be disciplined and remember that you have to focus on the opportunities in the world and not just the threats. The fact is in the long run those may end up making a bigger difference, because there you can make progress and you can build new ways of doing things. The key to it is looking at your schedule at the beginning of the week, and saying to yourself, As easy as it would be to only do the Middle East this week, I have to set aside some time for Africa, for Asia, for Latin America\u2014which we generally define as the opportunity regions\u2014and be sure we\u2019re hitting our marks on them.\n\nYou\u2019re part of the first brother team to make this list. What was your dynamic with [older brother David, president of CBS News] growing up? Did you argue politics over the dinner table?\n\nWe always got along very well. We definitely had different political perspectives. But in my family we were encouraged to argue about everything over the dinner table. And I think since then, we\u2019ve never been competitive, in part because we\u2019re in different fields. He\u2019s in media, I\u2019m in politics and foreign policy and that makes it easier for us to root for each other without competing in the same territory.\n\nDoes knowing him make you more or less cynical about media?\n\nSeeing his perspective about what people are interested in over the years definitely helped me understand that the media is in a high pressure business of their own and they have to find ways in a crowded information environment to report the news in a way that gets peoples attention. It gives me an understanding of the dynamic on the other end of the phone when I\u2019m talking to a reporter, which I have to do a fair amount of.\n\nThis story is from the October 27, 2014 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 In August 2013, transgender television personality B. Scott filed a suit against Black Entertainment Television and its parent company Viacom Inc., claiming that the network had discriminated against him based on his gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from Scott\u2019s appearance as a style correspondent at the 2013 BET awards preshow. After his first segment of the night, in which he appeared with heavy makeup and heels, the network told him to tone down his look and change into masculine clothing that was \u201cdifferent from the androgynous style he\u2019s used to \u2026 and comfortable with,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nA Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided the case Wednesday, and it came down to the First Amendment; not Scott\u2019s freedom to speech and expression, but Viacom\u2019s VIA . The court found that BET\u2019s decision as to how Scott would appear on camera was part of the network\u2019s creative process of developing and broadcasting the show, which is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nMORE: Americans have fallen in love with real estate once again\n\nThe case is by no means the first in which a media company has used the First Amendment as a defense against lawsuits alleging discrimination. The order on Thursday cites several other instances.\n\nThere was the racial discrimination case against ABC for its failure to feature non-white contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. A federal district court in Tennessee dismissed the matter after finding that \u201ccasting decisions are a necessary component of any entertainment show\u2019s creative content.\u201d The court said that \u201cthe plaintiffs seek to drive an artificial wedge between casting decisions and the end product, which itself is indisputably protected as speech by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nAnd there was the lawsuit filed against Warner Bros. by a former writers\u2019 assistant for the television show Friends who asserted that the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language and conduct by the show\u2019s writers constituted sexual harassment. The Supreme Court of California in that case held that \u201cthe First Amendment protects creativity.\u201d\n\nThe case that held greatest precedent is a matter in which a group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual Irish Americans sought to participate in Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. The U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately heard the case, ruled that it would be a violation of the First Amendment for Massachusetts to require private citizens \u201cwho organize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey.\u201d\n\nThe defendants in these cases argued that they didn\u2019t care what their employees or participants are in reality \u2014 gay, straight, male, female \u2014 but rather how they appear. \u201cThey say, \u2018We are entitled to create a program that looks the way we want it to look,\u2019\u201d says Eugene Volokh, a professor at UCLA School of Law. And the courts have agreed with them.\n\nMORE: The market for marketing software is accelerating rapidly\n\nReporting the news and creating a television show both qualify as exercises of free speech, according to Thursday\u2019s ruling in the Scott case. Outside those realms, however, the First Amendment defense against discrimination claims doesn\u2019t work as well. Abercrombie & Fitch anf , for instance, lost a bias suit filed by a Muslim employee that it fired because she refused to remove her head scarf. Abercrombie had argued that any deviation from its dress code threatened the company\u2019s success and that the lawsuit violated its First Amendment right to commercial free speech. A federal judge in California disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment line is really drawn at news and entertainment,\u201d Volokh says. The Supreme Court has found that \u201cpeople who make visual imagery are allowed to control what\u2019s in it.\u201d",

        "text": "Six Egyptians \u2013 possibly attendants of the Victorian photographer Francis Bedford and his companions \u2013 are arranged in a receding zigzag across the rough, uneven floor, dwarfed by walls, pillars and doorjambs in an austere, finely detailed 1862 image of the Ptolemaic Temple of Horus. Bedford must have insisted on between 10 and 12 seconds of complete stillness from the human figures in this majestic work, fully consonant with the 19th-century vogue for the timeless, immovable east \u2013 except for one deliberate anachronism. Between two of the pillars stands a white canvas hut. Here is Bedford\u2019s portable darkroom, scene of minute struggles with the collodion process for making glass negatives. Thus an art form barely 20 years old breaks the repose of Ozymandias.\n\nThe photograph is one of around 190 that Bedford took when he accompanied the 20-year-old Prince of Wales, Albert Edward (\u201cBertie\u201d), on a four-month tour of the Middle East in 1862, and which entered the Royal Collection after his return. They are currently on display at the Queen\u2019s Gallery in London, in a handsome exhibition that does not, however, fully explore all the possibilities of its subject.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, as we are not told in the Queen\u2019s Gallery, was under a cloud. The previous summer he had been initiated into the pleasures of the flesh by an Irish girl named Nellie, and it was from such beginnings that his scandalised father, Prince Albert, hit on the idea of an improving tour of the Ottoman dominions, focusing on the Holy Lands. But Albert had since died, his decline accelerated by his son\u2019s \u201cfall\u201d, and this made Bertie doubly odious to the grief-stricken Queen, who insisted that the trip go ahead while she plotted to marry him off. The prince, enjoying a gentle degree at Cambridge, and evincing no wanderlust, was powerless to resist.\n\nSetting off from Venice in February 1862, the smallish royal party (the principals consisted of Bertie, his governor, General Robert Bruce, and a handful of other, carefully selected, male companions) steamed down the Dalmatian coast and crossed the Mediterranean to Alexandria. From Egypt they went on to explore Palestine and Syria, living in tents and escorted by Ottoman cavalrymen, before sailing back to Europe via Constantinople. The trip took four and a half months, with Bedford as official photographer. His task was to immortalise scenes that were, as the Photographic News put it, \u201cfraught with historic and sacred associations\u201d.\n\nBedford was an experienced architectural and topographical photographer, with royal commissions already behind him, and he fulfilled his brief brilliantly. His harmonious, granular studies of the Egyptian temples and the Roman ruins at Baalbek, in Lebanon, accentuate the neglected, yet romantic, character of these places, with locals used for scale or foreground interest but offering no serious counterweight to the ruins among which they graze their goats or (in the case of Coptic Christians, appropriating part of a Pharoanic complex) come to pray.\n\nThe biblical sites as depicted by Bedford seem virtually unchanged since the Saviour\u2019s time. His Sea of Galilee, for instance, shimmers softly in a landscape that is empty but for the ruins of Tiberias \u2013 where the royal party took Easter communion. And there is little in his image of Jerusalem from Mount of Olives to suggest that these are not the very trees among which Jesus wept the night before his crucifixion.\n\nIt would have been helpful, in the sumptuously illustrated catalogue by Sophie Gordon, to have learned more about the religious importance of these places, which is so vividly evoked in contemporary pilgrims\u2019 accounts. Among these accounts are the entertaining letters of the liberal churchman Arthur Stanley, who was on the tour as Bertie\u2019s spiritual chaperone.\n\nArtists and even photographers had trodden the same paths before (the Englishman Francis Frith as recently as 1860), but each year, as the photo-historian Badr El Hage notes in his useful catalogue essay, brought more pilgrims, scholars and diplomats to a region that had seen few westerners since the Crusades. Passenger steamships (P&O began plying the eastern Mediterranean in 1835), guidebooks and the first Thomas Cook package tour gave notice of a harder, more permanent intrusion, with western museums filling up with Mediterranean fragments, the great powers using their concern for the Holy Places and religious minorities as a pretext for elbowing into Ottoman affairs, and, already, those mellow voids inspiring thoughts of a Jewish state.\n\nThe Tsar\u2019s brother had made his tearful pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre three years before, the Russian foreign ministry minuting that \u201cJerusalem is the centre of the world and our mission must be there\u201d. The British and French felt the same.\n\nOf the historical aspects of the itinerary, the Prince of Wales was indefatigably ignorant \u2013 as we know from Arthur Stanley, who felt affection for his boyish, good-humoured charge, but there was no denying that the young man was less moved by the scene of Elijah\u2019s sacrifice on Mount Carmel than the prospect of shooting quail on the same slopes, and if he wasn\u2019t complaining about all the \u201ctumbledown\u201d temples, he spent his time testing his travel companions on the plot of a recent potboiler.\n\nBertie was a keen souvenir hunter, acquiring, among other things, a mummy whose excavation he had witnessed, a papyrus funerary text and a beautiful scarab made of glazed, blue-green soapstone, which he had mounted on tiny gold python heads, as a brooch. (Except for the mummy, which has disappeared, these objects have been included in the exhibition.)\n\nFor the more thoughtful members of the party, there were considerable advantages to be gained from travelling with the heir to a quarter of the globe, not least permissions to visit the sepulchre of the Patriarchs at Hebron, hitherto inaccessible to Christians, and Jerusalem\u2019s Dome of the Rock, whose dilapidated dignity (it has since been lavishly restored) Bedford was one of the earliest photographers to record. \u201cThe prince entered the mosque,\u201d crowed the Illustrated London News, \u201cstanding where no infidel has stood since the Crusades.\u201d In Jerusalem, Bertie was tattooed with the Crusaders\u2019 Jerusalem Cross on his forearm.\n\nAlong with the great Umayyad Mosque at Damascus, also somewhat shabby through Bedford\u2019s lens, the Dome of the Rock is one of the few subjects that look better now than a century and a half ago. The pyramids have been all but consumed by Cairo\u2019s sprawl, and the then-sleepy Lebanese port of Tripoli, also photographed by Bedford, by Sunni-Shia conflict.\n\nReligious bloodshed was indeed a theme of the later stages of the tour, from visits to Crusader castles to the aftermath of a rankling three-way enmity between Christians, Sunnis and Druze. In 1860, Druze bands had laid waste to hundreds of Christian settlements in Lebanon \u2013 including the village of Hasbiya, which Bedford photographed. Most affecting, however, are his images of Christian Damascus, annihilated in the same year, with the buildings reduced to carcasses and not a soul in sight. Also in Damascus, Bedford made a rare portrait of an exiled Algerian nationalist leader who had given Christians sanctuary in his home.\n\nNowadays it is tempting to see communal conflict as endemic in the Levant and Mesopotamia, but the pogroms, whose effects the royal party witnessed had been notably rare until the 1840s. Bertie waxed indignant at Ottoman misrule, but Europe\u2019s sponsorship of local clients (for years Britain had supported the Druze, while the French backed the Maronites) had helped upset the old religious balances in the first place, foreshowing the cataclysmic communal violence of the final decades of the Ottoman empire.\n\nEven the cheapness of English cloth had sharpened resentments between the various groups, enriching the Christian agents of the Manchester houses and impoverishing Muslim weavers \u2013 unintended consequences of the Industrial Revolution and globalisation.\n\nIn June 1862, the tourists went their separate ways \u2013 Stanley nursing a mix of pilgrim\u2019s joy and filial sadness, for his mother had died in his absence, and Bruce a violent fever that would quickly kill him. Bedford got to work printing and exhibiting; his technique was commended by the cognoscenti and his images snapped up by the pious. As Gordon\u2019s biographical essay tells us, he went on to become a much-respected (and wealthy) photographer, and left \u201can extraordinary photographic legacy, much of which remains to be discovered\u201d.\n\nQueen Victoria found Bertie \u201cmuch improved\u201d by his travels, and \u201cready to do everything as I wish\u201d. Stanley was less sanguine, writing of \u201cthe difficulty of producing any impression on a mind with no previous knowledge or interest to be awakened\u201d. For all that, seven years later the prince would be drawn back to the Holy Land, this time in the company of his wife, the former Princess Alexandra of Denmark \u2013 and the recipient, as it turned out, of that beautiful, blue-green, python-mounted scarab.\n\n\u2022 Cairo to Constantinople: Early Photographs of the Middle East is at the Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London SW1A, until 22 February",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 No regular event on my calendar is more richly entertaining than my monthly dinners with a beloved friend from prep school, Alan Marcus. The setting is invariably the Post House, a steak restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The stories are as predictable as the venue. Alan \u2014 whom I alone in the world call by his sometime teenage nickname \u201cBig Al\u201d \u2014 recounts riotous tales of our misadventures at the Hun School, a then scrappy, decidedly non-aristocratic, now elite and thriving, prep school in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nOne of his classics recalls how his buddy, a Saudi princeling bearing a strong resemblance to his grandfather King Faisal, went on a hunger strike to protest the banality of his courses. Big Al aided the sheikh\u2019s cause by smuggling cheeseburgers to his hospital room. That Al and I keep revisiting the same material hardly detracts from our amusement. We\u2019re constantly adding changes in rhythm, improvisational touches, and original grace notes to freshen the old stories. After all, did genius jazzman Coleman Hawkins play his masterpiece \u201cBody and Soul\u201d only once? Did Picasso paint each new muse on a single occasion?\n\nExalting those dinners is the parade of distinguished guests invited by Big Al, who runs a prominent public relations firm in New Jersey. The roster includes a mega-watt real estate magnate, the chief of a great New York hospital, and the former CEO of a major financial exchange. A couple of years ago, as a surprise, Big Al brought a trim, soft-spoken septuagenarian sporting a white Panama hat whom he introduced as Judge Herbert J. Stern. Though I hadn\u2019t heard of Judge Stern, it was soon evident that I should have. Big Al ran through Stern\u2019s amazing resume. Stern served 13 years as a federal judge, and is now arguably the top white-collar defense lawyer in America, representing ex-Cendant chief Henry Silverman in lawsuits over his disastrous merger with CUC (the cases continue).\n\nStern also serves as a counsel for Chevron CVX in one of the longest-running, most highly-publicized cases in the annals of the oil industry, appealing the nation of Ecuador\u2019s $18.2 billion judgment against Chevron for allegedly polluting villages on the Amazon in past decades. One larger-than-life client was Bernard Lafferty the late, heavily-tippling butler to heiress Doris Duke, who inherited millions from her estate.\n\nMORE: Chevron claims Patton Boggs tried to cover up a fraud\n\nEven Hollywood has come calling. In 1979, the State Department chose Stern as the only judge ever to try a post-War case in West Berlin. Stern presided over the trial of two East Germans who, using a fake handgun, hijacked a passenger aircraft and forced the pilot to land in West Berlin. The events were recounted in a 1988 feature film Judgment in Berlin, based on Stern\u2019s book by the same name. Martin Sheen played Stern, and Sean Penn, son of the director Leo Penn, co-starred. \u201cMartin is a totally straight-laced, plain-spoken guy who\u2019s been married to his wife Janet for 41 years, and loves taking her on location with him,\u201d declares the judge.\n\nThen, in September, Big Al sent me a pre-publication version of Stern\u2019s new book, Diary of a DA. It rushes headlong from his role in indicting the assassins of Malcolm X to ridding then shockingly-corrupt New Jersey of dozens of criminal politicians and mobsters to stopping a heroin ring run by the head of France\u2019s CIA to showing the US Attorney in Maryland how to catch pols on the take, resulting in the resignation of America\u2019s Vice President, Spiro Agnew. The book covers just 12 years, ending in 1974, when Stern became a federal judge at age 36. Packed into that interval are triumphs that explode from the page like firecrackers, chronicling one of the great law enforcement records of the past half-century.\n\nSo I invited the judge to dinner to learn more about how he sustained his relentless quest despite opposition from politicians and bureaucrats, and what he thought of the current state of law enforcement. Naturally, we met at the Post House. Over the lamb chops, Stern wasn\u2019t coy, stating \u201cI would have gone after the Wall Street firms far harder than the authorities did, including using criminal indictments against the banks themselves if necessary. They were making billions selling mortgages to the public that they knew were bad.\u201d At the same time, he blames the system for filling our jails with addicts, diverting money and time from chasing the big-time criminals. He strongly advocates de-criminalizing marijuana and most other drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s undermining the public\u2019s faith in our laws,\u201d says Stern. \u201cIt\u2019s the practice of imposing laws from the bottom of society and not the top.\u201d\n\nMost of all, I wanted to know where he found the fire to barrel through case after case. \u201cHow could you not?\u201d he replies. \u201cI found myself in the most corrupt state in the nation. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d I also was intrigued by how Stern handled prosecuting so many politicians who had returned from World War II as heroes, only to fall prey to a culture of bribery and extortion. \u201cI had to show juries that I revered their service as brave soldiers,\u201d says Stern. \u201cIn other circumstances, I would have asked for their autographs. But I also argued they\u2019d betrayed the memories of the heroes they\u2019d left behind on the battlefields of Europe and the islands of the Pacific.\u201d\n\nDiary of a DA opens in early 1962 when Stern is sworn in as an Assistant District Attorney in New York City. \u201cThey give you a badge with your name on it. It looks just like a detective shield, only it isn\u2019t,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s not official. But it\u2019s good for showing friends, particularly girls.\u201d In an early case, Stern is asked to prosecute a famous composer and conductor who\u2019s been sending out letters trying to arrange orgies. At our dinner, as in the book, Stern declined to give the musician\u2019s name. Stern thought the case was ridiculous, and managed to settle it quietly while keeping the affair out of the newspapers. The conductor, Stern remarks in the book, \u201cthinks his lawyer did a great job. And he did.\u201d Meaning Herb Stern.\n\nThroughout Diary of a DA, Stern draws a sharp distinction between \u201cdoing law and doing justice.\u201d In 1972, the Nixon Administration, with the endorsement of FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, launched a crusade against anti-war activists. A Justice Department mole, masquerading as a peacenik, provided burglar tools and cash to a group of priests and other dissidents, which they used to break into a Selective Service Office and destroy records. Hoover personally requested that Stern\u2019s office, renowned for its aggressiveness, handle the prosecution.\n\nMORE: The copyright case that brought Costco and MoMA together\n\nIn the highly publicized \u201cCamden 28\u201d case, the blithe defendants were playing guitars in the hallways on breaks. Stern\u2019s lawyers let the peaceniks say whatever they wanted, and were far from displeased when the jury dismissed all charges. The defendants and spectators chanted \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d as the foreman announced the verdict. Years later, at the funeral the Stern deputy who tried the case, Stern learned that a priest who was one of the Camden 28 insisted on assisting at the mass. That priest, quips Stern in Diary of a DA, needs to attend another funeral to express gratitude for his acquittal \u2014 Herb Stern\u2019s.\n\nIn another early case, Stern wanted to indict a police officer who pulled a pistol when a driver refused to pull over, and, in a fit of anger, fired at the car, killing a pedestrian. But in those days, the District Attorney\u2019s office zealously protected cops, and barred Stern from prosecuting. Stern was appalled, and said so. The conflict caused severe tension between Stern and his bosses, and convinced the young prosecutor he should leave the DA\u2019s office. \u201cFortunately, that practice of protecting police officers when they commit crimes would never happen today,\u201d says Stern.\n\nBut before he departs, Stern is dancing in a Manhattan club, \u201cbouncing up and down,\u201d as he puts it, on a Sunday afternoon when he overhears a fellow reveller say that Malcolm X has just been murdered. As it happens, Stern is the Assistant DA on duty that day for Manhattan and is pretty relaxed, since Sundays are generally a quiet time in the law enforcement world. Stern assigns detectives to interview dozens of the 300 or 400 people who crowded Harlem\u2019s Audubon Ballroom when three gunmen fired on Malcolm. Within two weeks, Stern had all three, militant members of the Black Muslims, in custody.\n\nThe book contains excerpts from Stern\u2019s interview with Malcolm\u2019s widow, Betty Shabazz, who was basically stonewalled Stern\u2019s inquiry. \u201cShe clearly didn\u2019t trust law enforcement people,\u201d says Stern. Years later, Shabazz entered Stern\u2019s courtroom in a case against a record company that was using Malcolm\u2019s voice. After finding in her favor, Stern asked Shabazz, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d She replied, \u201cI certainly do, and you\u2019re more mellow now.\u201d\n\nIn late 1965, Stern joined the Department of Justice as an Assistant US Attorney, rising to become US Attorney for all of New Jersey in 1971, at age 34. At the time, mayors and officialS in Newark and other cities, many of them former war heroes, were taking bribes from contractors, orchestrating scams with mobsters who inspired the malefactors in the Sopranos, and forcing city employs to pay a percentage of their paychecks into their coffers. Senator Clifford Case declared that the \u201cstate left a stench in the nostrils of the nation.\u201d The culture of corruption crossed party lines in a bi-partisan travesty of the rule of law.\n\nMORE: A tale of money, sex and power\n\nStarting with a case against a crooked union official suspected of accepting bribes on a pipeline project, Stern developed a template he\u2019d use time and time again. He subpoenaed the financial records of the contractors, and looked for checks written to cash around the time the contracts were awarded. He then deposed the executives under oath, many of whom confessed to distributing envelopes stuffed with cash to union leaders and politicians.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Stern convicted the mayors of Newark, Jersey City, and Atlantic City, a congressman, the governor\u2019s chief aid, and numerous mobsters. In a hilarious vignette, he prods one Anthony Russo to disclose his nickname to the jury. \u201cLittle Pussy\u201d exclaims the mobster sheepishly. One juror became so excited by the revelations at one trial that Stern thought his bow tie would start spinning like a helicopter blade and lift him from the juror\u2019s box.\n\nStern also encountered a Jersey-style French Connection. The case wasn\u2019t the same as the drug caper that inspired the celebrated movie, but the intrigue was even more dramatic. In 1971, an operative for the French intelligence service, the SDECE, was arrested for smuggling 100 pound of heroin into Port Elizabeth, hidden in the panels of a VW camper. He quickly talked, charging that the chief of the service, a Colonel Fournier, had ordered him to make the delivery. The French first denied Fournier existed, then admitted he existed but was completely innocent. Stern indicted Fournier, and publicly demanded he be sent to the US to stand trial. The French minister of defense accused Stern of creating \u201ca serialized novel.\u201d French President Pompidou called President Nixon and threatened to call off a scheduled meeting between the two leaders in the Azores unless Stern stopped making his demands. Stern did quiet down, but kept pursuing the case.\n\nStern was summoned to Paris, where he spent three days with the Ambassador, Arthur Watson, son of the IBM IBM legend Thomas Watson. The ambassador even led him into a room lined with heavy plastic so they wouldn\u2019t be bugged. Watson eventually sided with Stern. Just before Stern departed, Watson delivered a rather odd message. \u201cDo you know what my father told me on my deathbed? Clothes do not make the man, but they make the businessman.\u201d Since Fournier remained in France, the case couldn\u2019t progress. But the French government soon removed him as chief of its CIA.\n\nAt our Post House dinner, Stern evokes surprising praise for the press, calling it \u201chis greatest ally\u201d during his years as a prosecutor. In his colorful phrase, \u201cthe press can summon the wind.\u201d He argues that politicians are like windmills. They start \u201cspinning in one direction trying to deceive the public, then the press summons the wind, and they spin in the other direction, since they\u2019re forced to tell the truth.\u201d For more from this master of the law and metaphor, don\u2019t miss Diary of a DA.",

        "text": "How is your work at txteagle changing the world for the better through technology?\n\nMobile phone subscribers in emerging markets spend on average 10% of their annual income on mobile phone airtime. By providing people with free airtime in exchange for completing a survey or engaging with a brand, we're enabling people in emerging markets to keep the money they would have spent on airtime in their pocket.\n\nHow has the company developed and how big can it become?\n\nThrough partnerships with over 220 mobile phone carriers, txteagle has created a database of over 2.1 billion emerging-market consumers, whom it can reach using proprietary messaging protocols and a unique airtime compensation platform. As a result, txteagle provides global brands direct access to their next billion consumers. What do rural Chinese doctors think about fruit juice? Can Brazilian teenagers be incentivized to buy a specific brand of shoe with group coupons? Do local merchants in Bangalore have regular access to the internet?\n\nThis is such a massive opportunity because of global brands' passion to reach emerging-market consumers. Brands are currently spending $120 billion a year on advertising in emerging markets, and that number is projected to grow to $210 billion by 2015. But they're not spending it well. At the moment, they don't have the consumer data to do the kind of targeted advertising that has become mainstream in developed markets. They can't use coupons and other basic tools of engagement in emerging markets because there typically isn't technology at the point of sale. Txteagle's unique ability to identify, engage and incentivize billions of emerging-market consumers presents almost boundless potential interest on the part of hungry advertisers. And it creates an enormous opportunity for a serious portion of those dollars to go direct to those consumers, who, as I like to say, could effectively get a 5% \"raise.\"\n\nDoes txteagle have the power to influence the way we work in the developed world, as it is does in the developing world? In the developed world, we, too, spend quite a bit of our income on mobile phones! So the idea of airtime compensation has a lot of untapped potential, including in exchange for consumer opinions, brand engagement, etc. But the opportunity in emerging markets is so enormous that we're focused on that pretty exclusively for now.\n\nIs there untapped potential in mobile technology's ability to alleviate poverty?\n\nAbsolutely. The role of the mobile phone has been vastly under-appreciated in the context of economic development. People tend to focus on whether surfing the Web, making phone calls, and sending text messages and emails are potentially transformative activities. But mobile phones not only provide a mechanism for global communication, they also allow for global compensation.\n\nMobile phones can catapult empowerment in ways we haven't even begun to imagine. For now, the passion (and the dollars) are coming from global advertisers \u2013 which will enable us to prove the power of airtime compensation. But once unleashed, that's a tool with infinite possibility. Compensation via mobile phones will ultimately provide supplemental income to a significant fraction of the global population.\n\nWhat can other innovators learn from your experiences? What do you know now that you wish you knew five years ago?\n\nLessons learned through failure can often turn into a competitive advantage. Learn these lessons as often as you can stomach!\n\nMy main lesson has been around the patience to match innovation to the receptive environment. My original, and abiding, passion is around economic empowerment via airtime compensation. It took me some time to learn to phase that vision: prove it first in partnership with advertisers, and then tap its potential in the infinite other ways people earn compensation. But it's the right lesson. Innovation doesn't exist in a vacuum; it's about matching it to people's needs with just the right timing.\n\nWhere is txteagle headed, what are your long term aims?\n\nMy ultimate goal at txteagle is to re-route 30% of the money spent on mass advertising in the developing world to the individual consumers themselves\u2014 meanwhile helping brands build loyalty, and helping consumers get the goods and services they want. As I mentioned above, if we succeed, 1 billion people will effectively have a 5% raise \u2014 plus a better consumer marketplace to enrich their lives. txteagle is partnering with several of the world's largest global brands and advertising companies to make this vision real.\n\nFinally, what can we expect from you at the Guardian's Activate Summit?\n\nI'm delighted to have the opportunity to be on the closing keynote panel. I'll also be on the lookout for global brands who wish to cultivate consumer insights, engagement, and loyalty in emerging markets.",

        "text": "When Boston officials suddenly closed the dilapidated bridge from Quincy to Long Island in October, displacing hundreds of homeless people, the clock started ticking for Jack Connors.\n\nThe ad mogul-turned-philanthropist has overseen Camp Harbor View, a summer camp for urban kids on the island, for nearly eight years. But with the bridge gone, Connors\u2019 renowned money-raising and arm-twisting skills are being put to the test. The camp\u2019s foundation has to secure two ferry boats, rebuild a pier, and ensure that underwater lines for power and water make it to the island before 450 children arrive in July.\n\nIf Connors is nervous, he isn\u2019t showing it.\n\nA few weeks ago, Connors dug into his fat Rolodex and started calling on deep-pocketed donors who could help cover roughly a half-million dollars in new expenses incurred by the sudden need for water travel. By hitting up previous Camp Harbor View contributors as well as some new ones, Connors said, he hopes to plug the gap by April. He\u2019s bracing for the worst: It could take four years or more before a new bridge is built.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise an extra $500,000 [per summer] for all these extra costs, for as many years as it\u2019s going to take,\u201d Connors said. \u201cWe have some multiyear commitments [already]. A couple have said they\u2019ll keep doing it until the bridge is back.\u201d\n\nConnors\u2019s progress so far shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. After all, it was the Boston business community\u2019s generosity that built Camp Harbor View seven years ago. Then-Mayor Thomas M. Menino had reached out to Connors to address the violence plaguing some neighborhoods in Boston. Connors remembered seeing a field on Long Island when he visited as a child and proposed to Menino that the city-owned property with one-of-a-kind views be turned into a summer day camp.\n\nConnors manned the phones, and the dollars poured in. The Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston was tapped to run the camp and oversee its programs. Nearly $7 million paid for site work, fields, and construction of the camp\u2019s \u201cgreat hall\u201d for its first year, in 2007. (Connors, of course, was a key donor himself.) Another $11 million flowed during subsequent years for other capital projects, such as a 150-foot pier and a swimming pool.\n\nThen there\u2019s the camp\u2019s operating costs \u2014 last year, the budget was about $3 million \u2014 primarily funded through a gala that draws hundreds every June. Some of the city\u2019s top rainmakers, such people as Suffolk Construction\u2019s John Fish and Steward Health Care\u2019s Ralph de la Torre, have lined up to help sell tickets for the event. This year, EMC chief executive Joe Tucci joins Connors as cochairmen of the gala.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the camp is running low on cash. Connors built up a $6.3 million endowment over the years. About half of that came from Partners HealthCare, the giant hospital group where Connors served as board chairman. Connors said the endowment\u2019s purpose is to ensure the camp survives long after he\u2019s gone \u2014 not to navigate a short-term emergency.\n\nCara Gould, senior executive director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, said most of the 900 kids, ages 11 through 14, who get to attend the camp\u2019s four-week sessions each July and August spend the bulk of their young lives within a three-block radius of their homes. They live just miles away from the ocean, she said, but might never see the sun glint off the waves if not for Camp Harbor View.\n\nThe first day of camp in 2007.\n\n\u201cBringing them to this island, it\u2019s like bringing them to another world, even though it\u2019s 20 minutes away,\u201d Gould said.\n\nTo pull that off without a bridge, Connors and company need a boat \u2014 a really big boat. That\u2019s why the foundation reached an agreement last month with Bay State Cruise Co. to use its slow-speed Provincetown II ferry, at a cost of $200,000 for the season. There\u2019s more than enough room to make daily trips for the campers.\n\nBut one boat won\u2019t be enough. Connors needed another vessel for the kids who miss the morning boat and the catering crew that will cook the hot lunches. That\u2019s where the 60-person Miss Peddocks Island comes in. Connors said he is paying $120,000 for the season to two brothers for use of their vessel.\n\nSo far, so good. But the boats need a place to land. Connors wants to use the state-owned Squantum Point pier in Quincy, not far from where the Long Island bridge is located. Unfortunately for Connors, the pier was badly damaged in a nor\u2019easter in October. A spokesman for the Department of Conservation and Recreation said the state agency hopes to reopen the pier in time for summer.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of utilities. NStar expects to disconnect power to Long Island this month as part of the demolition project.The bridge also carries water and phone lines between Quincy and the island. Those will be gone, too. But city officials say they\u2019ve given a contractor a deadline of June 15 to install utility lines in the seabed.\n\nThe variables have prompted Connors and his team to have backup plans: installing on-site electricity generators, using the island\u2019s old water tower, boarding at the World Trade Center pier where the Provincetown II is normally docked. But these solutions could cost more in terms of time or money, in part for the extra barge trips.\n\nGould, the Boys and Girls Clubs executive, said she\u2019s not worried about the remaining logistical headaches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a long time ago,\u201d Gould said, \u201cthat with Jack Connors behind you, things happen.\u201d\n\nThe Camp Harbor View foundation, spearheaded by Jack Connors, has to secure an extra $500,000 to run two ferry boats, rebuild a pier, and ensure underwater lines for power and water make it to Long Island before 450 children arrive in July.",

The symphony was written in 1767, the first full year Haydn (pictured) spent living at Esterh\u00e1za, the elaborate palace Haydn\u2019s patron and employer, Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy, built on the grounds of a hunting lodge near the Austro-Hungarian border. How elaborate? Work on Esterh\u00e1za would continue into the 1780s, at the eventual cost of some 13 million gulden. Converting Austro-Hungarian gulden is not the most straightforward task, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation, based on comparisons with average Viennese wages then and now, puts Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s cost, in modern dollars, well into the billions.\n\nThe dean of Haydn scholarship, H.C. Robbins Landon, plausibly speculated that the Symphony No. 35 was composed to welcome Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy home following a trip to Paris. That journey, too, involved Esterh\u00e1za: in search of new and interesting ways to spend lavishly on a residence, Nikolaus and his architect visited Versailles, another hunting lodge expanded into exceptional grandeur. However, the visit may have been somewhat anticlimactic, judging from the impressions of someone else who happened to be at Versailles in fall 1767: Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHaving been sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly (for a second time) to combat the Penn family\u2019s machinations, Franklin \u2014 accompanied by Sir John Pringle (future physician to George III) \u2014 made time for a French sojourn. Already renowned for his scientific achievements, Franklin was presented to the current monarch, Louis XV, whom Franklin described to his London friend Mary Stevenson as having \u201ca very lively look.\u201d Versailles itself, though, was less lively. The elaborate waterworks were \u201cout of Repair\u201d; elsewhere, Franklin saw \u201cshabby half Brick Walls and broken Windows.\u201d Versailles and Paris, Franklin concluded, were \u201ca prodigious Mixture of Magnificence and Negligence.\u201d\n\nThe dinginess failed to deter Nikolaus\u2019s ambition; Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s unrestrained splendor earned it the nickname of the \u201cHungarian Versailles.\u201d In the end, though, and like Versailles, Esterh\u00e1za became a museum. After Nikolaus\u2019s death in 1790, Anton Esterh\u00e1zy, his successor, decided that Esterh\u00e1za was too isolated for his taste. Anton\u2019s hobbies were more geological than musical; the extensive musical establishment Nikolaus had assembled was abruptly dismantled. It worked out well for Haydn, at least \u2014 freed from Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s continuous demands, the composer was f\u00eated in cities across Europe. Haydn, the palace-bound courtier, became Haydn, the musical citizen of the world.\n\nThe Boston Classical Orchestra, conducted by Steven Lipsitt, and featuring cellist Meehae Ryo and violinist In Mo Yang, performs music of Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart, Dec. 14 at 3 p.m. at Faneuil Hall (tickets $19-$74; 866-811-4111; www.bostonclassicalorchestra.org).",

It's the most turnovers Chicago has had in a game this season, in fact. And it's probably not surprising that Milwaukee would be the team to create such havoc. The Bucks' long-armed defenders employ a switch-heavy scheme that offensive players aren't completely used to seeing yet, with the strong-side pressure defense of Tom Thibodeau still preferred by many teams. And it works for Milwaukee; the Bucks led the league in opponent turnover percentage this season.\n\nSo, yes, the 28 turnovers from the Bulls were a lot. The 39 points Milwaukee generated off those turnovers were a lot, too. But one instance loomed larger than any other on the night.\n\nDerrick Rose brought the Bulls back with some stellar play in the final two minutes after struggling for much of the night. But with the game-winning shot Rose's for the taking, Khris Middleton stripped Rose and earned one final possession for Milwaukee with 1.3 seconds remaining. And, well, Jason Kidd drew this up and Jerryd Bayless executed:\n\nGame over. Milwaukee stays alive. And a big night from Jimmy Butler (see below) is all for naught.\n\nBest stat line: Stephen Curry, G, Warriors: 39 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists, 6-of-8 on 3's.\n\nWe're all going to need to become much more creative, because Curry will have us all out of superlatives sooner or later.\n\nCurry seems an affable chap, and it comes through in his reputation as a fan favorite. More than once, we've heard how Curry is the role model to which young girls and boys can aspire. No one can ever work so hard that he or she grows up to be 7 feet tall. But the exquisite shooting accuracy and deft ball-handling of Curry seem attainable, if only we work hard enough.\n\nDon't let the nature of the gifts fool you: Curry is ruthless. He's shown a knack this season for delivering when his opponents take their game to the next level \u2014 in game or across the country on the night before, and here, we're talking about you, James Harden. Curry is not to be outdone by anyone (except maybe Klay Thompson), and Saturday night was no exception, as the Warriors beat the Pelicans 109-98 to complete a first-round sweep.\n\nAnthony Davis put up another monster performance with 36 points and 11 rebounds. Against anyone else, it's the best stat line of the night, and the Pelicans go home with a win. But Curry isn't anyone else. He's the likely MVP, a star equally likely to bury a dagger or throw a pass that would make Magic Johnson get out of his seat and shimmy.\n\nOne can never discount the King as he reigns in Cleveland. But on nights like Saturday, it's hard to believe this long season belongs to anyone but Steph Curry.\n\nBest stat line, pt. 2: Jimmy Butler, G, Bulls: 33 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 3 steals.\n\nIf the Bulls are just going to keep alternating massive games from Butler and Rose, this team has a chance to make the Eastern Conference finals. But a bit of balance could go a long way toward Chicago surprising Cleveland and Atlanta and earning a spot in the NBA Finals, and it could have earned the Bulls a sweep on Saturday.\n\nIn a helter-skelter Game 4, Butler stood head and shoulders above every other player on the floor. No one came close to matching his 33 points \u2014 the second-highest scorer in the game, O.J. Mayo, scored just 18 points. But there's more to glean from that difference than might first meet the eye. One of the biggest reasons no Buck could hold a candle to Butler was Butler's outstanding defense on whomever the Bulls needed him to guard. In fact, Milwaukee had its greatest success when it ran out a lineup with Mayo, Jared Dudley and Jerryd Bayless, too many Bucks shooters for Butler to guard on his own.\n\nThe Bulls struggled with turnovers, and Butler coughed it up four times. But he was forced to assume much of the playmaking burden because of a quiet Rose (14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, 8 turnovers to 6 assists), so a handful of turnovers can be forgiven.\n\nMilwaukee staved off elimination for at least one more game thanks in large part to those turnovers (see below). But when Bucks fans are asked which Bull put the fear of summer vacation into them, they'll have but one answer: The Butler did it.\n\nBest individual play that symbolizes a Warriors sweep and the future of the NBA: Stephen Curry hits a ridiculous step-back jumper over the outstretched arm of Anthony Davis.\n\nSeriously, there is no better metaphor for where the NBA is, where the NBA is going, and this single first-round series than this shot:\n\nThe Pelicans were game in each of the four contests in the series. They nearly overcame insurmountable deficits, and they gave away a 20-point advantage in Game 3 that will haunt New Orleans fans for a while. And all of it was because of Davis. He couldn't have done it without Tyreke Evans or Ryan Anderson or any of the other Pelicans who stepped up, but it was The Brow who kept New Orleans within arm's reach for four incredibly entertaining games.\n\nAnd Curry and the Warriors were just out of reach each time, coming up with plays out of nowhere that broke the backs and dreams of the Pelicans.\n\nThis one goes to the Warriors. But it's safe to say that we haven't seen the last of Curry vs. Davis.\n\nBest quote: Steve Kerr has seen the future, and it is The Brow.\n\nSteve Kerr on A.D.: \"The guy will be the MVP within in the next few years, I think.\"\n\nBest impersonation of your opponent: The Nets became the Hawks to beat the Hawks.\n\nMaybe Brooklyn as a basketball entity is just a giant chameleon, and playing in the Eastern Conference meant that the Nets took on a bad basketball environment and reflected it in their own play. Introduce a passing machine like the Hawks into Brooklyn's home environment, however, and the Nets turn into a whirling buzzsaw of passes and finishes at the rim.\n\nCan we talk about that Brooklyn home environment for a second, though? Granted, Saturday's game was a pretty early start. But this isn't the greatest showing in playoff fan history, Nets supporters.\n\nBest picture that is clearly not at all a foul: Zach Randolph and Robin Lopez are besties.\n\nListen, referees will let marginal contact go if it doesn't create an advantage for either player, and this collision between Randolph and Lopez is clearly nothing out of the ordinary. It's just two very, very large men trying to get a rebound. Nothing to see here. Next play!\n\nUnlike Lopez, Blazers fans are likely anxiously tugging at their collars, as Saturday night's 115-109 loss to the Grizzlies leaves Portland in 3-0 first-round hole.\n\nBest insight into why Mike Budenholzer is the Coach of the Year: Budenholzer started to draw up a play, decided against it.\n\nThe sign of a true genius is the ability to recognize that simplicity is best. Sure, you could desperately design some crazy set to try to get your team back into the swing of things on the road. Or you could trust the system, shrug your shoulders, and say, \"Let's just play.\"\n\nIt didn't work out in the end for the Hawks, but it was a refreshing glimpse of a coach conceding that sometimes you just need to let players make plays.\n\nBest visual: Kosta Koufos jams all over C.J. McCollum.\n\nCredit to McCollum for putting his body and pride on the line here, but this highlight is not for the faint of heart.\n\nBest use of film study to make an opponent sad: Bojan Bogdanovic perfectly read a Hawks play, got the steal.\n\nTechnology has changed the NBA.\n\nIt's perhaps an under-discussed part of the way the league has evolved, but film study is easier today than it's ever been \u2014 and it's becoming even easier by the day. A player can fire up Synergy on the plane, in the locker room, at the hotel, hell, even on the bench. Whenever and wherever he is so inclined to study, the material is always available.\n\nThat easy access to information makes each and every player who chooses to use it that much smarter and that much more prepared. And it makes going up against such thoroughly informed defenses all the more difficult. Banning hand-checking on the perimeter undoubtedly opened up the game, and that maybe made things easier for elite wing scorers to get past the first line of defense. But once that primary defender is in the dust, an entire system of switches and hedges, of helping and communicating, waits to swallow up all but the very best offensive efforts.\n\nIt might seem that this is a simple steal from Brooklyn's Bogdanovic, on a missed opportunity by Atlanta. But note the switch Bogdanovic makes based on what he knows of the Hawks offense and his faith in the information he's gathered and the studying he's done.\n\nHours and hours of work likely went into that one play. In the playoffs, it's all worth it.\n\nBest improvisation that was completely ineffective and thoroughly hilarious: Leandro Barbosa throws a pass to no one to avoid a travel.\n\nIt might have been better to just suck it up and take the up-and-down violation on this one, Brazilian Blur. But thank you for sacrificing your pride for the sake of the people's entertainment.\n\nBest at being the worst: Aaron Brooks got up close and personal with Jerryd Bayless.\n\nLet it never be said that you have to be a big human being to turn a basketball game into a chippy affair. Brooks is generously listed as 6 feet tall, but he has no problem playing the instigator.\n\nBrooks picked up three fouls in just six minutes, including a flagrant for the shove on Bayless.\n\nBest blatant disregard for the mid-quarter entertainment during a game: Joey Crawford has places to be, people!\n\nListen, elderly Nets dancers, we understand that you're just trying to thrill the crowd with your choreographed shenanigans. But Crawford needs to get from here to over there, and he doesn't have time to wait for you. There's basketball to be officiated.\n\nBest wishes to a player after a scary injury: Mike Conley suffers blow to the head, taken to medical facility.\n\nHere's hoping that the Grizzlies point guard make a speedy and full recovery after an inadvertent elbow from C.J. McCollum forced Conley from Game 3 in Portland in the third quarter.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 When Joe Stinziano, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics, took the stage recently at a press event on the future of smart TV, few might have expected him to talk about the quietest device in the living room: the remote control. \u201cUntil now, the remote control has basically stayed the same for 50 years,\u201d Stinziano said, before proceeding to unveil a bevy of innovative new features.\n\nIndeed, Stinziano cast a spotlight on a device that may very well be the last piece of home entertainment equipment to undergo broad, fundamental change. Hampered by manufacturing costs, infrastructure, and competing technical standards, the remote control has gotten little attention even though the average household now has four of them, each with its own confusing array of buttons and services. What changes remote controls have gone through have mostly been evolutionary. That may be starting to change.\n\nWhy has the remote control been a long-time victim of innovation? \u201cIt\u2019s always come secondary to the television or set top box it\u2019s been paired with,\u201d says Michel Alvarez who was lead designer when Boxee TV, a progressive home theater PC software application, developed its flagship set-top box and dual-sided remote. \u201cAs manufacturers continued to invest production costs on making sure the main unit delivered on its competitive features, remote control innovation sat on the back burner, ultimately plateauing the relationship between the remote and the television.\u201d\n\nMORE: The mistake Netflix is making now\n\nIt didn\u2019t start that way. The first wireless remote was a marvel, introduced by Zenith Radio Corporation in 1956 and engineered by Robert Adler. Called the \u201cZenith Space Command,\u201d it offered a simple interface, consistent with consumer habits for watching television at the time. With its introduction an evolution happened: choice or remotes was granted to consumers for the first time. Findings emerged that began to shape programming: 25% of viewers changed the channel once the credits started rolling since they could change the channel sitting down. Yet by the turn of the century, the remote\u2019s design faltered under the weight of multiple systems. Not only did it multiply by device \u2014 while one remote shipped with a TV, another shipped with the cable box \u2014 but the separation of labor and service provider caused an unstoppable multiplicity of buttons.\n\nZenith 300With the introduction of new services to the living room \u2014 VCRs, DVRs, DVD and Blu-ray players, game consoles \u2014 device infraction emerged on the coffee table because each new box pack its own remote. And while universal remotes intended to unite the confounding multiple experiences, it was often a less usable version of simple versions from manufacturers.\n\nAnd there wasn\u2019t much incentive to focus on the problem. \u201cMid- and low-end TV sales are very sensitive to margins, and so many manufacturers effectively gave up trying to own the entire experience and focused on lowering manufacturing cost and on investing in picture quality,\u201d says Jun Lee, a partner at ReD Associates, an innovation and strategy consultancy, \u201cThey reduced the price of remote control manufacturing to $1 for the average remote to $3-5 for a \u2018premium\u2019 remote, but they also knew the remote was no longer a primary point of contact between their customers and the TV viewing experience.\u201d\n\nMORE: 5 things that mattered at SXSW\n\nThere is a chief difference, however, between cable or TV manufacturers (where remote controls are often an afterthought) and the business of making remote controls. Take Logitech LOGI , who for 30 years has been making personal peripherals. These devices win design awards year after year. \u201cWe have customers come in to our office on a weekly basis, says Kevin Simon, director of Product Research. \u201cPeople often don\u2019t know what they want or what their pain points are.\u201d As part of their process, they do a combination of lab studies at their headquarters, ethnographic studies, and traditional surveys. Even the Harmony Link, one of their remotes on the market, effectively crowdsources live behaviors so that each new addition becomes available for Harmony Link users everywhere.\n\nThings could be turning around. Two non-traditional remotes have recently put better control in front of consumers, effectively raising expectations for gesture and voice. First the Kinect, a Microsoft MSFT Xbox remote that supports both voice and gesture input without a device at all. Apple\u2019s AAPL Siri, which shipped with the iPhone 4S, recognizes voice commands, and helped result in $46.33 billion in revenue by the end of 2011 just a few months after it was introduced. And if history is any evidence, Siri has already changed consumer expectations and behavior irreversibly. \u201cApple unified service and product on the iPhone. It may try to make a similar move on TV,\u201d says Lee.\n\nMeantime, Samsung introduced its Smart Interaction technology with face recognition, gesture, and voice control, intended to provide choice for how consumers interact with their TV. And while Samsung still supplies the Smart Touch Remote and traditional remote in the box, the way consumers can interact with them clearly tips a hat to what its voice and gestural predecessors have done well.\n\nMORE: Time to redefine \u201cinnovation\u201d\n\nBut is the advent of voice, gesture, and touch really more control for consumers in a remote? \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to pick up a remote control,\u201d says Chris Harrison, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), \u201cYou\u2019re sitting in your living room and snap your fingers. It\u2019s like clicking the button for Siri. The computer looks for whatever hand is being held out\u2014that is your remote control. Then you type \u2018Channel 52\u2019 or the top five shows you love watching on your DVR and click play. It\u2019s getting away from the paradigm of a remote control. Your whole room is interactive. That\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\n\nTogether with Microsoft Research and a CMU colleague, Harrison prototyped a mobile interaction system, OmniTouch, that turns any surface, including the human body, into a screen. Both OmniTouch, and another of his on-body interface projects, Armura, offer a new evolution of control\u2014one where human interaction with our media experience dissolves into something much simpler: the environment itself.\n\nSo what this the future of the remote control? \u201cWe need to bring great new interaction and interface design to the remote control itself, the compatibility, the crowdsourcing. We absolutely need that because that is what the customer is buying. They demand innovation when they buy our product as opposed to when they buy a cable package,\u201d Simon says. Meanwhile manufacturers will experimenting with voice, gesture, and touch and consumers will play, voting for their choice with gestures and buttons on how to put the control in the remote experience. At least finally this is an evolution, one Joe Stinziano\u2019s audience has been waiting to hear about for more than fifty years.\n\nLiz Danzico is chair and co-founder of the MFA Interaction Design program at the School of Visual Arts.

        "text": "Lucian Freud was a fundamentalist in his belief that thoughts of the artist should never be allowed to interfere with their art. They should appear \"no more than God in nature\", he once wrote. So it was probably as well that he seldom gave interviews, because there was certainly a lot to talk about. Freud was famously gregarious, and loved the good life, including expensive food and cars. (His regular table at the Wolseley was said to be set with a black cloth last night.) And \"it is thought\", in the cautious words of this BBC profile, that he fathered \"dozens\" of children.\n\nThe legends about his ramshackle (some would say disgusting) studio were also true \u2013 as you can see from the dirt and paint that cakes the walls in this extract from Tim Meara's film Small Gestures in Bare Rooms. For a fuller profile, the best film available online is Jake Auerbach's Portraits (2004), made up of interviews with his friends and family. Part one includes, among other things, the memory of his friend, the novelist Francis Wyndham, being taken to the River Cafe in Freud's glamorous car. \"You know how frightening he can be as a driver,\" Wyndham says. In the second part, fellow artist David Hockney remembers sitting for Freud, and is full of praise for his work. \"I think they're as good portraits as have been done by anybody, actually,\" he says. The third part is here.\n\nAmong critics, the London Review of Books art writer Peter Campbell made a superbly detailed study of Freud's technique, following his visit to Tate Britain's 2002 retrospective. There is also this film on YouTube, which is far from slick \u2013 indeed it's annoyingly shoddy \u2013 but it does give a good summary of Freud's influences and development.\n\nThe Today programme this morning carried a clutch of interviews, including with Sue Tilley, the subject of several of Freud's portraits. Most notable among them was Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, which became the most expensive painting by a living artist ever sold when it was bought for \u00a317m in 2008, reportedly by Roman Abramovic at the instigation of his girlfriend, collector and millionairess Dasha Zhukova.\n\nTilley also spoke in more depth to BBC Breakfast this morning, revealing that the famously protracted process of sitting for Freud was not exaggerated \u2013 taking \"three days a week for nine months\" in her case. \"You'd think he was a very serious person,\" she adds, \"but his excitement when he met Kylie Minogue beggared belief.\"\n\nPerhaps his closest literary counterpart, when it came to documenting the grotesque glory of the human body, was John Updike. And maybe it's a fitting way to say goodbye to one of the greatest British painters ever to read this short poem, in which the writer pays tribute to Freud's work.",

This research clarified to me how London could expand eastwards \u2013 more or less what is happening now with the Olympic Games as the catalyst.It is very interesting to see it becoming a reality. I think one of the great challenges is the fundamental restructuring away from the \"Fordist\" paradigm of an industrial mass society towards a society with much greater degrees of complexity and dynamism in people's lives. So hybrid mixed-used buildings have become very interesting. There also needs to be a further shift away from zoning \u2013 you live here, work there and play somewhere else. By layering all these uses together, in the same zone, it completely changes the way we look at cities.\n\nIn 1989 there was no city government planning anything, it was all pretty haphazard. Broadly, No one in 1989 realised the long-term impact of deregulation was going to be so dramatic for the financial sector. There was an assumption of slow decline. Now, we've got the London Plan, which I devised and which came into force in February 2004, which is a strategy through to 2025. Given the length of time it takes to get things done, the only big question mark now is the transport projects like Crossrail \u2013 they depend on the outcome of the next general election: whether you get a government who's prepared to back that sort of investment. London might not grow as well as it should, it might not be as environmental a city as it should be, but I don't think anyone's going to see London as a failure.\n\nThere will be serious talk of bringing back a riverbus service for the Thames. There will be more white ghost-bicycles than any other kind, cycling being compulsory for those who want access to the National Health Service . Privileged lanes for VIP non-participants will have expanded and public lanes shrunk. Tickets will be at a premium for permanent show trials, inquiries into inquiries, after terrorist outrages and botched judicial executions. Film, television and other forms of electronic communication will happen on fingernail-size screens and be without content, other than re-runs of\n\n. Locality won't exist, the slab or vertical stack being the universal form. West Ham FC will debate a move into the part-demolished Olympic stadium. The late Ken Livingstone, in computer-generated form, fresh from his triumph in\n\n, will be re-elected as mayor.\n\nThe key thing is that the population of London will have risen to around 9m which is well above its previous highest level, and there will be an even bigger concentration of economic activity than now. London's capacity to attract people from all over the world \u2013 rich Americans and Europeans to asylum seekers \u2013 will continue. So by 2030 London will be a city that is over 40% overseas-born, even higher than it is now. There will be a similar percentage for the non-white population, so it will be even more cosmopolitan than it is today. In a curious way this cosmpolitan-ness and the tolerance that goes with it becomes a self-reinforcing factor, so it becomes even more attractive to people who are footloose, international and often talented. The skyline will probably have even more towers on it, it will probably be a city which has had to tackle congestion more comprehensively by then. What there will certainly be is a greater number of electric vehicles: by then small, silent electric vehicles will be much greater in number and there will be many fewer noisy, dirty, big vehicles of the kind we accept as normal today. we'll look back on the streets today and wonder how it was possible to tolerate the diesel-driven big vehicles: there'll be pressure to improve the air and environment, that's for sure. There's no evidence thus far of any society getting away from railways, especially when they're all built. The one thing I don't think there will be a move away from is working in city centres, or in the centre of London, but for many years there have been prophets who think that eventually people because of electronic communication will be able to work from home and visit the city centre occasionally; I think that analysis is wrong: partly because many people want to go to work, they enjoy the social element. Outer London, the bit that most people live in but people outside London don't know so well, will benefit: partly as a result of the population growth but also due to the Olympic development in the east. I think the big question is what happens to other parts of London, particularly south London where economic prospects have always been more challenged.\n\nFashion shows becoming live will be increasingly popular - that's going to take off and in twenty year's time should be well-established. It's allowing two things: first it allows the consumer to see it as soon as it hits the catwalk, and then through sites like netaporter.com you can buy the clothes before they get to the shops, so that's changing the whole way people consume fashion and the way they see it. We're seeing the embryonic form of a new medium happening now. People are living their lives through their mobile phones and laptops. In terms of what people will be wearing it depends on which society-changing events you get between now and then. Any form of civil unrest on a large scale or wars, influence fashion. You really have to start looking at politics: what clothes people wear is dependent on what their role in society is. Fashion is unpredictable, as events are. I'd like to see the parameters of what we consider beauty completely enlarged: we're really only presented with one version of how women should look at the moment and that's really quite shocking. I hope that we'll no longer tolerate being shown images of ourselves in such narrow parameters.\n\nFood growing in the city will be commonplace: oil shocks and a growing awareness of food security will have encouraged people to grow their own. Rooftops and spare places will be full of vegetables: not, obviously, enough to feed the city but enough to reconnect people to food and make them more resilient and more aware of where food comes from. A much higher percentage of our food will come from farms around London with a lessening of dependency on foreign imports. Oil prices and water shortages will make this essential. We will have electric chargers across the city and electric vehicles will be commonplace. Biking will have increased dramatically \u2013 and proper bike super-highways will allow Londoners to commute across the city. Food co-ops will be common and waste will be used for power and not go to landfill. Recycling will be second nature and all homes will have smart meters, both for electricity and water usage. It won't be an age of austerity but it will be an age of watchfulness.",

The article below was originally published at entrepreneur.com.\n\nThere was a time when knowing how to program was for the geekiest of geeks. That\u2019s not exactly the case today. As most entrepreneurs, freelancers and marketers will tell you, learning how to program can help you succeed. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been learning to code. It\u2019s helped me to become a much better entrepreneur\u2014I can dive in when my team needs to fix a few bugs on the site.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to shell out a ton of money or put yourself in debt to learn how to code, either. These 12 places offer coding courses for free:\n\nOne of the most popular free places to learn coding is CodeAcademy. In fact, more than 24 million people have already learned how to code through this educational company\u2019s engaging experience. At CodeAcademy, you can dive right in and take courses that teach you everything from HTML & CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Python and Ruby.\n\nFounded in 2012, Coursera has grown into a major for-profit educational-technology company that has offered more than 1,000 courses from 119 institutions. While you can pay for certain programs to receive a certificate, there are a number of free introductory programming courses in various specializations from universities such as the University of Washington, Stanford, the University of Toronto and Vanderbilt.\n\nEdX is another leading online-learning platform that is open source instead of for-profit. It was founded by Harvard University and MIT in 2012, so you know that you\u2019ll learn about cutting-edge technologies and theories. Today, edX includes 60 schools. You probably can\u2019t go wrong with the free Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard University.\n\nFounded in 2010, Udemy is an online learning platform that can be used as a way to improve or learn job skills. While there are courses you have to pay for, there are plenty of free programming courses, which are taught via video lessons, such as Programming for Entrepreneurs \u2013 HTML & CSS or Introduction to Python Programming.\n\nAGupieWare is an independent app developer that surveyed computer-science programs from some of the leading institutions in the U.S. It then created a similar curriculum based on the free courses offered by Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley and Columbia. The program was then broken into 15 courses: three introductory classes, seven core classes and five electives.\n\nWhile you won\u2019t actually receive credit, it\u2019s a perfect introductory program for prospective computer programmers.\n\nSometimes, you need to recall a reference book when you\u2019re stuck on a problem. That\u2019s GitHub. You can find more than 500 free programming books that cover more than 80 different programming languages on the popular web-based Git repository hosting service, which means that it\u2019s frequently updated by collaborators.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already learned the basics, and went to get into something a bit heavier\u2014such as exploring the theory behind coding\u2014take advantage of MIT\u2019s free courseware site that includes classes such as Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, Introduction to Programming in Java and Practical Programming in C.\n\nThis is a community of developers, which include some high-profile developers such as Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent. There, you can perfect your programming skills by learning from some of the leading developers in the world.\n\nBased out of New Zealand, Code Avengers provides fun and interactive programming courses that will teach you how to code games, apps and web sites using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Each course takes just 12 hours to complete and is available in English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Turkish and Portuguese.\n\nCreated in 2006 by educator Salman Khan, Khan Academy is one of the original free online-learning institutions. With step-by-step video tutorials, you can learn how to program drawings, animations and games using JavaScript and ProcessingJS, or learn how to create webpages with HTML and CSS.\n\nHere you\u2019ll learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Databases, DevTools, Node.js, Angular.js and Agile by networking and joining a community of professionals and students. You\u2019ll even work together on your coding skills so that you can build apps for free. Here\u2019s the catch: you\u2019re learning those skills and building helps to help solve real-world problems. Code is available to nonprofits.\n\nThis Google project launched in 2010 to counter Apple\u2019s HTML5. The site is full of tutorials, resources and the latest HTML5 updates. It\u2019s open source, so developers can play around with HTML5 code. Because this is more advanced than most introductory courses, you may want to gain some knowledge and experience before jumping in.\n\nLearning code used to require access to expensive books and classes, but no longer. I highly recommend that every entrepreneur learns to code. Still wondering if you need to code?

        "text": "It\u2019s undeniable that Salesforce, the San Francisco software company, has transformed how companies in industries as diverse as financial services and higher education manage their customer relationships. Now it\u2019s bringing its cloud-based technology to the world of healthcare.\n\nSalesforce CRM announced on Wednesday a new patient relationship management platform that it calls Salesforce Health Cloud. The product is part of the company\u2019s new push to change how doctors and healthcare providers effectively manage the health of patients across caregiver networks.\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud combines data from multiple sources\u2014electronic medical records, medical devices, even wearables\u2014into a single location. The idea? By having all the information in one place, health workers will have a more complete view of the patient and, in turn, be able to make smarter care decisions, intervene earlier if issues arise, and collect data along the way for effective treatments. The software also puts that information in the hands of the patient through mobile applications.\n\n\u201cWhat gets measured, gets improved,\u201d says Joshua Newman, doctor and chief medical officer for Salesforce\u2019s Healthcare and Life Sciences division. \u201cWith everything in one place, now you can see what really affects outcomes. Is it a phone call? A text message? We haven\u2019t had that data before. The things that every business in America thinks about every single day that have never been in healthcare before and are now being brought in by demand.\u201d\n\nA common goal among recently introduced healthcare technologies is the improvement of the patient experience. For example, the industry is transitioning away from a pay-per-service model and toward holistic, outcomes-based reimbursements. Medical offices know that they need to provide more comprehensive care to stay relevant. A first step is collating all of a patient\u2019s pertinent information, regardless of where the care took place.\n\nThat\u2019s where Salesforce Health Cloud steps in. The company is working with leading software vendors and systems integrators to tie together existing medical IT systems and layer on Salesforce\u2019s trademark customization.\n\nThe challenge with healthcare IT is that most information is stuck in proprietary software silos, hindering the ability to interact across the care spectrum. About 95% of healthcare providers say interoperability challenges limit their ability to transfer data from one medical center to another, according to a study by healthcare alliance Premier. That leaves dangerous gaps in care as information trickles through various IT systems.\n\nConsider a patient who visits an urgent care center for a cough that at first seems benign. The doctor on duty may not know that the patient visited two weeks ago for the same cough and noted shortness of breath during his last physical. If all that information were fed into a single database, a pattern would emerge and\u2014with hope\u2014lead to better diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\u201cHealthcare providers face a significant challenge. To deliver the best patient care possible, they rely on data sitting in multiple systems,\u201d says Ross Mason, founder of billion-dollar software startup MuleSoft, which is working with Salesforce to integrate outside data into the platform. \u201cConnectivity is the key to unlocking this data and making it useful.\u201d\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud has been in development with several health and medical device companies to date, including Centura Health in Colorado, Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, and the University of California, San Francisco. The platform begins previews today and will officially launch in February. Salesforce said it will release pricing for the service at that time.\n\nWith hope, Salesforce Health Cloud can bridge the gap and provide a place where various health care providers can interact, including case managers, doctors, nurses, caregivers, and insurance coordinators. It\u2019s a massive task\u2014one that puts the cloud company in league with health companies like Athenahealth ATHN and other more-targeted firms like Cardinal Health\u2019s naviHealth CAH , which focuses on post-acute care coordination.\n\nSign up for Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter about the business of technology.\n\nFor more Fortune health coverage, watch this video:",

The study finds that kids reprimanded for lying are more likely to bend the truth, while kids who are given a moral reason for truth-telling tend to believe that honesty is the best policy.\n\nResearchers traced the effectiveness of punishment in 372 kids between the ages of 4 and 8, finding that children were less likely to tell the truth when threatened with punishment, and more likely to tell the truth when they thought it would please an adult.\n\nIn order to gauge the implications of punishment on a child\u2019s propensity to lie, researchers placed each participant alone in a room with a toy, and asked the child not to peek at the toy for an entire minute. It\u2019s hardly surprising that curiosity got the best of most children, with 67.5 percent peeking, and 66.5 percent of those who peeked going on to lie about it. (Note: older children were less likely to peek, but were also more likely to lie about peeking after they\u2019d done so.)\n\n\u201cChildren often lie to conceal transgressions,\u201d says study researcher and McGill professor Victoria Talwar. \u201cHaving done something wrong or broken a rule, they may choose to lie to try to conceal it. After all, they know they may get in trouble for the transgression. Thus, punishment doesn\u2019t have much of an effect. It doesn\u2019t deter them from using the strategy of lying to try to get out of trouble.\u201d\n\nSo, how should parents go about encouraging their children to tell the truth when the impulse to lie is so strong? McGill\u2019s study indicates that kids respond best to a strong moral appeal for honesty. Younger children were inclined to tell the truth to make an adult happy, while older children were inclined to do so because of their own internalized definition of right and wrong \u2013\u2013 facts that might come in handy when your little one is caught red handed with the leftover Halloween candy.\n\n\u201cThreats about punishment are not deterrents for lying, and they do not communicate why children should be honest,\u201d says Talwar. \u201cIf a child is playing with a ball in the house and breaks your vase but tells the truth about it when asked, you should recognize that he came clean. He may still have consequences for his transgression, but the child learns that honesty is valued.\u201d\n\nThese findings reinforce a more progressive approach to parenting, and indicate that it\u2019s better to explain truth-telling to children using positive reinforcement than the threat of harsh consequences. \u201cGlobally, we generally think of lying as a negative behavior,\u201d says Talwar. \u201cHowever, we sometimes fail to recognize the positive behavior \u2013\u2013 honesty. If a child is confessing his transgression, we need to recognize that he was honest.\u201d\n\nRead next: Parents Should Try Being Present Instead of Perfect",

The latest numbers for 2014-2015 indicate that women made up just 27% of all creators, directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and directors of photography working on broadcast network shows.\n\nBroaden that to include cable and other sources and the number gets even grimmer: women accounted for 25% of those working on network, cable, and Netflix shows. This represents no change from last year\u2014and an increase of just 6% from the first study in 1997-1998.\n\nWomen\u2019s representation in front of the camera is a bit better. The report, which looked at sampling of network, basic and pay cable (A&E, AMC, FX, History, TNT, USA, HBO and Showtime) and Netflix shows, found that 42% of all speaking roles and 42% of major characters were female.\n\nHollywood\u2019s ageism double standard is also evident in the results. Most female characters are in their 20s and 30s (60%) whereas most male characters are in their 30s and 40s (55%). And opportunities plummet for older actresses (not to mention older audience members looking to see themselves reflected onscreen). Thirty-one percent of female characters were in their 30s, 18% were in their 40s, and just 2% were in their 60s or older.\n\nMinorities have an even greater challenge: 77% of female characters were white, 15% were African-American, 3% were Latina, 4% were Asian, and 1% were of \u201csome other\u201d race or ethnicity.\n\nThe good news is that when women do have key creative roles, they are more likely to create more opportunities for women. On network shows with at least one female creator, women comprised 50% of writers\u2014whereas women made up 15% of writers on shows with no female creators. On programs with at least one female executive producer, an average 43% of major characters were female. Compare that to shows no female executive producers, where an average 37% of characters were female.\n\nSince HBO\u2019s Project Greenlight premiere on Sunday, Matt Damon has been getting flack for interrupting Effie Brown, the one African-American female producer on the show, to say that selecting a diverse directing team isn\u2019t the solution to getting better representation of women and minorities on screen. But this report suggests otherwise.\n\nSays Dr. Martha Lauzen, author of the study, \u201cThe findings suggest that creators and executive producers play an instrumental role in shifting the gender dynamics for both on-screen characters and other individuals working in powerful behind-the-scenes roles.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.",

        "text": "Pierre Ferrari listens to a group meeting of the Pooja women\u2019s group in a school building in Janakpur, Nepal. Geoff Oliver Bugbee / Heifer International\n\nThe mission of Heifer International is an ambitious one: to end hunger and poverty around the globe. But although that may seem like an improbable dream, to date, Heifer has delivered on a grand scale, lifting more than 20 million families out of poverty and hunger.\n\nThe organization\u2019s strategy is to give people the tools, education, and livestock that will help them build livelihoods and strengthen their communities. Animals are at the center of this plan, providing life-sustaining products such as milk and wool, and creating a chain of giving -- each family that receives an animal, agrees to pass on its offspring to another individual in need. This simple yet powerful act is called \u201cPassing the Gift.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Heifer educates communities on how to manage their water resources, supports small-scale farmers, and empowers women by helping them become more self-sufficient.\n\nAt the helm of Heifer\u2019s efforts, is President and CEO Pierre Ferrari. Born in the Belgian Congo (today called the Democratic Republic of Congo), Ferrari assumed leadership of Heifer in 2010, bringing more than 40 years of business experience to an organization which celebrated its 70th anniversary this year.\n\nHere, Ferrari shares his passion for the work and explains how the women of the world have inspired him.\n\nWhat do you most want people to know?\n\nThat the poor are not responsible for their poverty and misery. Most of them struggle in conditions that are subhuman, dangerous, full of disease, hunger and despair. But when Heifer International offers a sliver of hope, they grab it with astounding energy, enthusiasm, creativity and optimism. Heifer approaches farmers who are eager and who we know will rapidly strive toward self-reliance and autonomy. We are there to help them do; we don't do it for them.\n\nWhat motivated you to get involved in this work?\n\nOne of my earliest ambitions was to work in development. I had planned to work at the World Bank after getting my MBA, but it didn\u2019t work out that way. I spent 20 plus years in corporate business, but the pull to engage in social issues finally got me to leave Coca-Cola and join CARE in the mid \u201990s. I then worked in a variety of ways that were mostly oriented to development of distressed communities.\n\nI think both my mother and grandmother influenced me deeply towards this work. My grandmother had a wholesale and retail vegetable business in Elizabethville (now Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo), working with local African farmers to produce the goods she needed for her trade. I remember going to the villages and buying the produce they had grown at her request, and the importance this trade had on their livelihoods and health. It felt like good and important work. They adored her.\n\nWho or what has made the greatest impression on you during your involvement?\n\nAll over the world I come across women who take on leadership roles with energy, vision and great engagement. It is really inspiring. They push me to help more, to move faster, and to support their efforts as they drive to end despair, poverty, hunger, abuse and more. They can leverage our help one hundredfold. They focus on their families and their communities.\n\nWhat have you been most surprised to learn?\n\nThe depth of passion my colleagues and others in the sector have to help others. It is a commitment for life -- and to life -- for so many. The work is hard and sometimes frustrating, but it\u2019s shouldered with great joy and hope.\n\nWhat has been the hardest part of this work, or how has it most challenged you?\n\nDevelopment is hard work, and one needs to be patient. Changes only come when the individuals, families and communities decide for themselves that it is time to radically change their own reality. Internal change is hard. It takes patience, and I am not a patient person, but I am learning.\n\nHow has this work changed you?\n\nThis work has deepened my study of systems, networks, complexity and human motivation. Finding the places where systems can be changed in the most fundamental ways, is important. Becoming more of an activist and an advocate for changes in systems (economic and political) that are responsible for exploitation and maintaining the status quo at the expense of the poor; and channeling resources to combat that exploitation, is exhilarating.\n\nWhat goal do you have for the next 12 months?\n\nAll of us at Heifer have been implementing substantial changes in our way of working in the world. We have scaled up our work as demanded by our partners in the field. We have installed systems that are making us more efficient and effective, and we are raising needed resources in a more balanced way to ensure our stability and impact. Now we will take advantage of all these improvements to help the communities and women with whom we work accelerate their escape from poverty and hunger.\n\nFor more information and inspiration visit MariaShriver.com",

Five couples living nearby told the court how their first reaction on hearing bangs, screams or cries was to verify what they heard with the person next to them.\n\n7) The trigger of the gun Pistorius fired had to be pulled four separate times to fire the four shots, suggesting a conscious action.\n\n8) He could not explain how he never heard or saw Steenkamp leave the bed to go to the lavatory moments before he started shooting into the door, despite her being just feet away from him.\n\n9) Pistorius said Steenkamp never responded to his instructions to call the police, or made a sound as she hid in the lavatory. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said this was \"impossible\" to believe.\n\n10) Witness Dr Johan Stipp told the court he saw a light on in Pistorius' bathroom when he heard shots fired; the athlete said he was \"too scared\" to switch the lights on until after the shooting.\n\n1) Pistorius had a heightened fear of intruders because his family had been victims of crime many times before, and this made him react more dramatically to a perceived threat.\n\n2) The athlete felt especially vulnerable because he did not have his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots. A psychologist said his reaction might seem \u201cextraordinary\u201d for an able-bodied person, but could be explained by his disability. The Paralympians\u2019 team doctor said disabled people often exhibited more dramatic \u201cfight-flight\u201d responses, and Pistorius would have chosen to fight since he was unable to flee.\n\n3) Pistorius suffered from a Generalised Anxiety Disorder, a psychiatrist who evaluated him found, which along with his disability may have made him react more extremely to a perceived threat.\n\n4) Pistorius fought to save Steenkamp's life and was, witnesses said, distraught by what had happened.\n\n5) The state presented scant evidence of the row they say prompted the shooting, through witness testimony or communication between the couple. The majority of Steenkamp's WhatsApp messages reflect that she was happy with the athlete. She also wrote him a Valentine's card in which she revealed she was in love with him.\n\nOscar Pistorius listens to evidence in court (AP)\n\n6) Sound tests conducted by the defence showed Pistorius screamed like a woman when he was anxious, his lawyer Barry Roux said, explaining the \"woman's screams\" neighbours heard.\n\n7) Both prosecution and defence accept there were two sets of bangs: the gunshots and Pistorius later breaking down the door with a cricket bat when he realised Steenkamp was in the lavatory. Sound tests suggested the two sounded very similar. The gunshots neighbours thought they heard might have been Pistorius breaking down the lavatory door.\n\n8) Neighbours who heard a woman screaming only heard one set of bangs; the timings of phone calls to estate security made by those witnesses, and Pistorius' phone calls to the estate manager and friends after he broke down the door, suggest they didn't hear the gunshots, only Pistorius screaming for help and the second set of bangs from the cricket bat.\n\n9) Police contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective clothing, moving key exhibits and walking over the lavatory door.\n\n10) Prosecutors decided to charge Pistorius with premeditated murder when they believed he took time to put on his prosthetic legs before firing the fatal shots. State forensic experts later agreed with the defence assertion that Pistorius did not have his legs on when he fired the shots.",

But as he delayed even saying Trump\u2019s name, he was able to tell listeners, \u201cvote your conscience.\u201d The audience did not take warmly to his advice.\n\nThank you, and god bless each and every one of you.\n\nHeidi and I are so honored to join you here in Cleveland where LeBron James just lead an incredible comeback victory, and I am convinced America is going to come back too.\n\nI want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.\n\nCRUZ: And, like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November.\n\nConventions are times of excitement, but given the events of the last few weeks I hope you\u2019ll allow me a moment to talk to you about what\u2019s really at stake. Just two weeks ago a nine-year-old girl named Caroline was living a carefree Texas summer. Swimming in the pool, playing with friends, doing all the things a happy child might do. Like most children, she relied upon the love that she received from her mom, Heidi, and her dad, a police sergeant named Michael Smith.\n\nThat is until he became one of the five police officers gunned down in Dallas.\n\nThe day her father was murdered, Caroline gave him a hug and a kiss as he left for work, but as they parted her dad asked her something he hadn\u2019t asked before. \u201cWhat if this is the last time you ever kiss or hug me?\u201d\n\nLater, as she thought of her fallen father, and that last heart breaking hug, Caroline broke down into tears. How could anything ever be OK again? Michael Smith was a former Army Ranger who spent decades with the Dallas police department. I have no idea who he voted for in the last election, or what he thought about this once, but his life was a testament to devotion.\n\nHe protected the very protesters who mocked him because he loved his country, and his fellow man. His work gave new meaning to that line from literature, \u201cTo die of love is to live by it.\u201d\n\nAs I thought about what I wanted to say tonight, Michael Smith\u2019s story weighed on my heart. Maybe That\u2019s because his daughter Caroline is about the same age as my eldest daughter, and happens to share the same name. Maybe it\u2019s because I saw a video of that dear, sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her Daddy\u2019s last question to her.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil in places like Orlando, and Paris, and Nice, and Baton Rouge. Maybe it\u2019s because of the simple question itself. What if this right now is our last time? Our last moment to do something for our families, and our country? Did we live up to the values we say we believe? Did we do all we really could?\n\nThat\u2019s really what elections should be about. That\u2019s why you and millions like you devoted so much time and sacrifice to this campaign. We\u2019re fighting not for one particular candidate, or one campaign, but because each of wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids, our own Caroline\u2019s, that we did our best for their future and our country.\n\nAmerica is more than just a land mass between two oceans, America is an ideal. A simple, yet powerful ideal. Freedom matters.\n\nFor much of human history government power has been the unavoidable constant in life. Government decrees and the people obey, but not here. We have no king or queen, we have no dictator, we the people constrain government.\n\nOur nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most beautiful and powerful words in the English language, \u201cI want to be free.\u201d\n\nNever has that message been more needed than today. We stand here tonight a nation divided. Partisan rancor, anger, even hatred are tearing America apart. And citizens are furious, rightly furious, at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises, and that ignores the will of the people.\n\nWe have to do better. We owe our fallen heroes more than that.\n\nNow, of course, Obama and Clinton will also tell you that they care about our children\u2019s future, and I want to believe them but there is a profound difference about our two party\u2019s vision for the future.\n\nThere\u2019s is the part that thinks ISIS is a J.V. team, that responds to the death of Americans in Benghazi, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d And, that thinks it\u2019s possible to make a deal with Iran that celebrates its holidays, \u201cDeath to America Day,\u201d and, \u201cDeath to Israel Day.\u201d\n\nMy friends, this is madness. President Obama is a man who does everything backwards. He wants to close Guantanamo Bay, and open up our borders. He exports jobs, and imports terrorists. Enough is enough.\n\nAnd, I am here to tell you there is a better vision for our future. A return to freedom.\n\nOn education your freedom to choose your child\u2019s education, even if you aren\u2019t as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.\n\nOn healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor without Obamacare.\n\nOn taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.\n\nThe Internet? Keep it free from taxes, free from regulation and don\u2019t give it away to Russia and China.\n\nFreedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.\n\nFreedom means religious freedom, whether you are Christian, Jew, Muslim, or atheist.\n\nWhether you are gay, or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience.\n\nFreedom means the right to keep and bear arms, and to protect your family.\n\nFreedom means that every human life is precious and must be protected.\n\nFreedom means Supreme Court Justices who don\u2019t dictate policy, but instead follow the Constitution.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And, freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values. Colorado might decide something different than Texas. New York different than Iowa. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be, diversity.\n\nIf not, what\u2019s the point of having states to begin with?\n\nNow, Hillary Clinton believes that government should make virtually every choice in your life. Education, health care, marriage, speech, all dictated out of Washington. But, something powerful is happening, we\u2019ve seen it in both parties, we\u2019ve seen it in the United Kingdom\u2019s unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union.\n\nVoters are overwhelmingly rejecting the political establishment, and overwhelmingly rejecting big government.\n\nThat is a profound victory and it is one earned by each and every one of you. People are fed up with politicians who don\u2019t listen to them. Fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites instead of working men and women.\n\nWe deserve an immigration system that puts America first, and yes, builds a wall to keep America safe.\n\nA government that stops admitting ISIS terrorists as refugees. We deserve trade policies that put the interests of American farmers over the interests that are funding the lobbyists.\n\nAnd, if we stand together and choose freedom, our future will be brighter. Freedom will bring back jobs and raise wages. Freedom will lift people out of dependency to the dignity of work.\n\nWe can do this. Forty-Seven years ago to this day, America put the very first man on the moon.\n\nThat was the power of freedom. Our party, the Republican party, was founded to defeat slavery.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, the first Republican president signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTogether we passed the Civil Rights Act, and together we fought to eliminate Jim Crow Laws.\n\nThat\u2019s our collective legacy, although the media will never share it with you. Those were fights for freedom, and so is this.\n\nSergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom. So do the soldiers, and sailors, and airmen, and Marines everyday fighting radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nAnd, so did the family of Alton Sterling who bravely called to end the violence. So did the families of those murdered at the Charleston-Emanuel AME Church who forgave that hateful, bigoted, murder.\n\nAnd, so can we. We deserve leaders who stand for principal, who unite us all behind shared values, who cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect from everybody. And, to those listening, please don\u2019t stay home in November.\n\nIf you love our country, and love our children as much as you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom, and to be faithful to the constitution.\n\nI appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.\n\nAnd I will tell you that it is love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams. Like my mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my dad, who\u2019s here tonight, who fled prison and torture in Cuba. Coming to Texas with just $100 dollars sewn into his underwear.\n\nAnd it is over that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving nine- year-old girl in Dallas, and God willing, propel her to move forward, and dream, and soar, and make her daddy proud.

        "text": "The commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military must have the sound judgment to know when to use America\u2019s military power and, just as important, when not to use that power.\n\nTo his credit, President Barack Obama has displayed throughout his presidency an instinctive reticence to launch military strikes. The most disastrous foreign policy decisions during the Obama years as commander in chief occurred when he trusted the advice of others over his own instincts.\n\nWhile President Obama agonized over whether to use force to overthrow Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, it was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s impassioned and persistent arguments in favor of military action against Gaddafi that tipped the scales in what has been described as a very close 51-49 Obama decision to use force.\n\nFive years later, President Obama describes Libya as \u201ca mess.\u201d A failed state, Libya is now a haven for terrorist organizations including ISIS fighting for control of the country.\n\nIn Syria, where Secretary Clinton has repeated her advocacy of military intervention to overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad, President Obama is roundly criticized for having drawn a \u201cred line\u201d in the sand\u2014threatening that the U.S. would bomb Syria if Assad were to use chemical weapons against the Syrian people\u2014and then failing to follow through on that threat a year later when it was reported that Assad had in fact used chemical weapons on his own people.\n\nIronically, it took tremendous courage and character for President Obama to back down on his threat to launch a military attack on Syria. There should never have been a \u201cred line\u201d drawn, but after it was drawn and then crossed, there were but two choices: launch a bombing campaign against Syria or back down and endure harsh criticism both at home and overseas.\n\nThe decision to not create yet another completely failed state in the Middle East and open the door to a takeover of all of Syria by ISIS and other terrorist organizations is one that some say may have cost him credibility, but I believe it may have been one of President Obama\u2019s finest moments as commander in chief.\n\nThis episode in Syria underscores a pivotal decision we as a nation must make when choosing our next commander in chief: Will we elect a president who has the judgment and foresight to refuse to be drawn into unnecessary and counter-productive wars of regime change? Or will we elect a president eager to intervene in other countries and cavalierly use U.S. military power to overthrow foreign leaders we don\u2019t like?\n\nThis is not to say that we should be anything other than strong and determined to do what it takes to defeat those who wage war against America. But at this time in American history, we need a commander in chief who has the courage to reject the flawed and wasteful foreign policy of interventionism, regime change and unnecessary war.\n\nI\u2019ve endorsed Bernie Sanders to be our next president and commander in chief because I\u2019m convinced he is the only person running for president who has the intelligence, foresight and good judgment to make sound decisions when it comes to the issue of war and peace.\n\nWe need a commander in chief who will end the illegal and counter-productive war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad. Sanders has promised that as President he will end that war in Syria and focus on defeating those who threaten our safety\u2014groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. In contrast, Clinton favors an escalation of that war and advocates a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d in Syria that would cost billions of dollars, require tens of thousands of ground troops and a massive U.S. air presence, while also risking a head-to-head confrontation with Russia.\n\nSimilarly, while Sanders understands the need to defeat al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist organizations that attacked America on 9/11 and who continue to wage war against us, he has made it clear that he will not waste American treasure and lives on interventionist wars of regime change and so-called nation building.\n\nIn both Clinton\u2019s record and her campaign rhetoric, she has made it clear she will do the opposite\u2014that she favors a continuation of the counter-productive and horribly expensive foreign policy of intervention and regime-change.\n\nIn this election, we have an opportunity to express our national will. Who are we as a nation? Where are we headed? What kind of world do we want to leave for our children and their children?\n\nWe could vote for Clinton and continue to spend trillions of dollars on interventionist regime-change wars and so-called nation-building overseas. Or we could vote for Sanders, end these costly, counter-productive wars and use our precious taxpayer dollars to rebuild our own nation.\n\nThe choice in this election could not be more clear.",

        "text": "Quo Vadis, Senator Bernie Sanders? For months Sanders has scored higher in the national polls against Donald Trump, than Hillary Clinton, highlighting some of her drawbacks for the November showdown. Yet, with one primary to go next Tuesday in the colony known as the District of Columbia, the cries for him to drop out or be called a \u201cspoiler,\u201d are intensifying. Don\u2019t you understand that you have been vanquished by Hillary? You must endorse her to unify the party.\n\nNo, Bernie has other understandings beyond his principled declaration in speech after speech that his campaign is going all the way to the Democratic Party Convention. Between the June 14th D.C. Primary and the July nominating convention, lots can happen. As Yogi Berra said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d (The run-up to the primary is a perfect time for Sanders and Clinton to forcefully advocate for DC Statehood.)\n\nLike Trump, Hillary has imploding potential. Her email troubles are under Justice Department investigation and revelations are still bubbling. The smarm surrounding the Clinton quadrangle of Bill\u2019s huge speech fees, mining and other magnates securing concessions in foreign dictatorships, the role of the State Department and giant gifts to the Clinton Foundation continue to surface. Also intriguing is the fact that Hillary continues to stonewall any public disclosure of the transcripts, contractually in her exclusive possession, of her $5,000-per-minute, closed-door speeches to big banks and other industries.\n\nBut Bernie has other core reasons for not dissipating his bargaining power by descending to the bended-knee posture of a toady. He has to keep his supporters focused and hoping. The sure alternative, should he drop out, is a huge howl of outrage, followed by splintering of his voters\u2014some to Trump, others to Hillary, still others staying home in cynicism and withdrawal. Such chaos and rage will not be good for Hillary. She needs Bernie\u2019s voters in an electoral college, winner-take-all system.\n\nMaintaining the solidarity of Bernie\u2019s voters increases the seriousness with which his drive to change the rules, rigged against insurgents, in the Democratic Party, led by the unelected cronyism of the Superdelegates, comprising nearly 20% of the total delegates. Sanders\u2019s triad of protections for workers, students and patients, coupled with squeezing the unearned profits of Wall Street for a wide public works program, needs more visibility. Political Parties should be about serious subjects. Voters want to replace some of the tedious convention hoopla with some authenticity. Perhaps Senator Sanders could also urge Hillary Clinton to choose a running mate who would be more substantive and not just a tactical choice or an obeisant person. The pundits marvel at his ability to reject PAC money and raise millions from a large pool of small donors, with contributions averaging around $27\u2014self-imposed campaign finance reform. The Chattering Class should also be impressed with how strongly Sanders\u2019s message has resonated with the electorate.\n\nGranted, platforms have not been worth the paper they are written on. But that is because little in them is worth their paper. The Democratic Party\u2019s cautious monoculture had nothing to invoke as standards for subsequent political decision-making. Sanders brings political directions, often backed by a majority of the American people, that win or lose can become the legacy for a post-convention non-partisan citizen movement. Who better to expand the energy than this remarkable, uncharismatic, scandal-free Senator from a small, once safely Republican state?\n\nThere are still lessons that Sanders can teach the decadent corporate Democrats for whom this 2016 campaign may be their last hurrah. It is called political energy. It is the lack of political energy that explains why the Democratic Party, year after year, cannot defend the country from the worst Republican Party, on its own record, in Congressional history. It is political sectarianism that explains why the Democratic Party, with majoritarian issues at hand, has not landslided the Republican Party that votes for many bills which often register support under 30% in the polls. It is this absence of political energy, seduced by big money in politics, that the Sanders youth movement is aiming to topple. The Sanders people understand that breaking the momentum breaks the movement. That is why the longer range rebound of Bernie Sanders, right after Labor Day, must be mass non-partisan civic mobilization rallies driven by reforms and redirections that are for the people at large. That such class-levelling, peace-waging, freedom to participate in power for a more just society may benefit the Party\u2019s electoral prospects is a collateral benefit from a galvanizing civil society.\n\nBernie can start this fundamental movement for a functioning democracy with a massive rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and then take it regionally and locally. All along this march can make the faces of preventable injustice visible. New leaders to improve and deepen Bernie\u2019s agenda will step forward and the whole will become greater than the sum of its parts. Ready solutions for the good life and its possibilities will come off the shelves as people\u2014both left and right together\u2014begin to realize what is meant by our Constitution\u2019s sovereignty of the people over political and corporate rulers.\n\nThat a long-time, lone-ranger Senator can get this far is a tribute to his focus on widely-felt, repressed priorities. His candidacy is contrasted with the avarice of the plutocratic/oligarchic corporate state. This dominant corporatism possesses few loyalties to country and community other than to control them while treating the workers\u2019 economy with disinvestment and unbridled globalization.\n\nBoth Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower warned their fellow Americans about this subordination of our government to big business and its impact on our liberties and livelihoods.\n\nPerhaps the sonorous \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d call at Sanders\u2019s gigantic rallies around the country has its echoes in those similar warnings by these leaders\u2014one Democrat and one Republican\u2014coming from their experience during the Great Depression and World War II.",

On top of perks like unlimited education reimbursement, compressed workweeks, a 10% company contribution to employees\u2019 401(k) funds, and healthy medical plans, Salzmann says Acuity has instilled loyalty among its employees by empowering them and giving them a say in the company\u2019s future. Quarterly town hall meetings keep employees up to speed on the company\u2019s performance.

For all those reasons, workers have raved, and annual full-time voluntary turnover is a ridiculously low 2%.\n\nYet the best example of employee enthusiasm and loyalty can be found on YouTube in a short video bearing the title ACUITY Zombie Apocalype. It\u2019s the collaborative work of 40 employees who dressed as the undead for a four-minute explainer about why they love their jobs. The video\u2019s tagline? \u201cAcuity is a great place to work now \u2026 and after the zombie apocalypse.\u201d It took one day to film and two weeks to produce, all during working hours.\n\nIn addition to welcoming oddball initiatives, employees say their suggestions are taken seriously and their contributions are rewarded on more individualized bases.

        "text": "As the decibel level drops in Oakland, let's take a look at some playoff-related observations from around the NBA.\n\nThrough three entire days and nights of the 2015 postseason, we have zero defeats tagged on the Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Atlanta Hawks and Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe Bulls have a 2-0 cushion against the Milwaukee Bucks, increasing the odds that they'll reach the Eastern Conference semifinals. And if that happens, Chicago likely will be matched against the Cavs, who simply seem too offensively gifted to avoid winning three more games against the Boston Celtics.\n\nWhen the season began, most watchdogs were predicting a Bulls-Cavs matchup in the conference finals. A Bulls-Cavs showdown offers Derrick Rose against Kyrie Irving and Jimmy Butler taking on LeBron James. Cleveland four man Kevin Love would be required to do work against Joakim Noah.\n\nThe Warriors \u2014 up 2-0 after some uneven moments against the New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 weren't the popular choice to win the Western Conference when the regular season began, but they're a team many neutral observers would like to see reach The Finals.\n\nAs for Finals potential, a Warriors-Cavs battle would co-star first-year NBA head coaches Steve Kerr and David Blatt (the guy Kerr attempted to hire as an assistant at Golden State).\n\nA love of the long ball are a common trait of this season's playoff teams.\n\nThe first three days and nights have come and gone with some trends emerging. Or perhaps we should refer to them as continuing trends from the regular season.\n\nThe eight teams with the highest percentage of field-goal attempts occurring behind the 3-point arc are 7-3. Eight of the nine teams that hoisted the most 3s during the regular season reached the postseason.\n\nThe 16 playoff teams have averaged 97.5 points per game \u2014 down from the 100 averaged by all 30 during the regular season.\n\nThis only reminds us that teams still working are more committed to (and successful at) defense than most of those that aren't.\n\nThose much-discussed, regular-season defensive issues of the Chicago Bulls have been (at least) temporarily assuaged by playing the Milwaukee Bucks. After struggling since their big trade-deadline moves, the Bucks are averaging 86 points in two losses to the Bulls while making only 37.5 percent of their field-goal attempts.\n\nAnd, in tribute to the individual skills of their superstars, the Clippers are fourth in scoring average and last in assists ... for now.\n\nAfter a slight bump next season, NBA teams have been advised that the salary cap will jump $20 million in 2016 and another $20 million the following off-season.\n\nAt last week's Board of Governors meetings in New York City, teams were warned/advised that the salary cap \u2014 subsidized by the league's new TV deal \u2014 could balloon as much as earlier projections suggested.\n\nNext season's cap is expected to increase from $63.1 million to $67.1 million per team, followed by a jump to $87 million in 2016-2017 and $108 million the following season.\n\nNext summer's almost-$20 million hike could provoke some big decisions for members of this summer's free-agent class ... and the teams attempting to hire them.\n\nShould the players in question seek a shorter deal and look to cash in when the cap reaches crazy levels? That's what we'll probably see from LeBron James, whose potential to play tremendous basketball each season seems fairly predictable.\n\nBut what about prospects who have not exactly produced at levels commensurate with how they're about to be paid? Will they attempt to hammer out shorter deals and bet on their ability to outplay those contracts?\n\nOr will they go the security route, opting for long-terms deals now?\n\nTeams, of course, will have similar decisions.\n\nPlease note that the players' union and teams also could opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement a year from this December.\n\nKevin Durant and Connecticut coach Kevin Ollie are buddies from their days as teammates with the Thunder.\n\nWith rumors of Scott Brooks' demise as head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, it's time for some dedicated reporters to dust off rumors that Connecticut coach Kevin Ollie will be pursued by OKC as a means of coaxing the reenlistment of franchise superstar Kevin Durant.\n\nDurant, you may recall, is fond of Ollie, who was a Thunder teammate five years ago.\n\nIt also should be pointed out that the buyout from Ollie's contract at UConn \u2014 sweetened after he coached the Huskies to the 2014 NCAA tournament championship \u2014 is a cool $5 million. But with the league's new TV bounty and the threat of losing Durant, that probably wouldn't be prohibitive.\n\nIn another form of superstar-free agency chatter, there's a reported 50-50 chance that power forward LaMarcus Aldridge will return to the Portland Trail Blazers this summer. The surprisingly low 50-50 was the tally of current teammates polled for their opinions.\n\nThe notion of Aldridge looking elsewhere gained steam after the Blazers were boat-raced in their first-round opener against the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nSpeaking of Memphis, Grizzlies free agent-to-be Marc Gasol and Aldridge reportedly are both potential targets of the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nEnjoy the Clippers-Spurs matchup for as long as it lasts; it's too bad it didn't come later in the playoffs.\n\nThanks to rewards for division champions (hello Blazers), the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers are meeting in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nThis means we'll reach the conference semis with one of these really outstanding teams on vacation.\n\nBut let's enjoy this particular matchup while it lasts (hopefully seven games).\n\nIt starts with the mind games co-starring Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and Doc Rivers of the Clippers.\n\nAnd then there's the marquee point-guard battle between Tony Parker of the Spurs and L.A.'s Chris Paul.\n\nAlthough it would be foolhardy to dismiss the Spurs after convincingly losing Game 1, which two NBA superstars have more to prove than CP3 and teammate Blake Griffin?\n\nBy the way, it really is annoying listening to TV analysts barking about the Griffin-Tim Duncan matchup. Unless there's a switch or cross-match in transition, those two rarely will square off.\n\nFollow Randy Hill on Twitter",

Obviously a place called the USA can still be found on the map, but today's WikiLeaked behemoth is no longer the dream nation that once seemed to epitomise everything modern, big and brave.\n\nGrowing up in Wales, born just in time to see the moon landings on TV, I absorbed this great American myth like children all over the world. But to look at the art of one of the most idealising observers of that lost America is to see how fragile, how brief, its golden age really was.\n\nThe first of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers displayed at Dulwich Picture Gallery was published on 20 May 1916; the last, on 14 December 1963. That is the end of this selection of magazines but not of his work \u2013 the exhibition has a painted study for his rightly famous 1964 picture of Ruby Bridges walking to school in defiance of rotten vegetables thrown by segregationists that splatter the wall behind her. But in the 60s, as he records protest and revolution, is it still \"Norman Rockwell's America\" he paints?\n\nThe same question arises when you try to make sense of his early works from the first world war and the 1920s. Their lost world of knickerbockered tearaways and brave doughboys (American soldiers in the great war) seems not just remote, but somehow, not America at all as we imagine it. America was an invention, you realize by looking at the work of Rockwell, one of its inventors, and what startles is to realise how recent that invention is.\n\nOnly in the 1930s does his America start to look like the confident modern nation of band music and the movies; and it is in the 1940s with images such as Rosie the Riveter that Rockwell captures the deeply attractive qualities of that American modernity with its sense of freedom and potential equality.\n\nMovingly, Rockwell defied the conservatism of his image and perhaps of his fans when he lent his visual eloquence to the civil rights cause in the 1960s.\n\nThis exhibition, the first of his original works in this country, does him an injustice. It fails to respond to the surprise and the radicalism of Rockwell at his best \u2013 there is more emphasis on coy Christmas scenes than on his powerful paintings of an America growing into its imperial greatness and then facing up to its failings.\n\nInstead of popularising Rockwell (and America) with a young British audience, it seems happy to see him as a safe figurative artist and positively glories in his most conservative traits.\n\nIn America this talented artist has been reclaimed as a visionary of liberalism and tolerance; but in Dulwich he comes across as an obscure nostalgist and his era, the American century that on this evidence lasted just two decades from 1940 to 1960, seems further away than ever. At his best he suggests why we are going to miss it.\n\nNorman Rockwell's America is at Dulwich Picture Gallery, Gallery Road, Dulwich, London SE21 7AD, until 27 March.",

        "text": "A Biography of D. H. Kahnweiler, 1884-1979.\n\nIllustrated. 411 pp. New York:\n\nDaniel-Henry Kahnweiler was 23 years old when he opened his first art gallery in Paris. It occupied a tiny space on the Rue Vignon, near the Madeleine, and its aspiring proprietor did not have a single artist under contract. Indeed, he had hardly met any. The year was 1907 - an important date in the history of the Paris avant-garde. Like many of the people who took an avid interest in avant-garde developments in Paris at that historic moment, Kahnweiler was a foreigner - a German Jew, born in Mannheim, whose prosperous family had expected him to follow tradition by making a career in the stock market or the banking business. Instead, he decided to become an art dealer, and - what was even more shocking - a dealer in avant-garde art. ''He knew nothing about the business of selling art,'' Pierre Assouline writes in his biography of Kahnweiler, ''knowing more about art itself than about the art market.''\n\nWhat Kahnweiler did possess in large measure, however, was a keen sensibility for the modernist art that was meeting with such adamant hostility from established opinion. For those in the know, of course, Paris loomed as the international capital of the modern movement - the magnet that drew ambitious, independent talent from every corner of the Western world - but neither the French public nor the French press was yet willing to grant the achievements of the modernists even minimal recognition. The rejection of everything avant-garde in Paris was still fierce and unforgiving.\n\nIn 1907, the brunt of this philistine abuse was directed against Matisse and the Fauves - ''Wild Beasts'' - who had lately exhibited their audacious paintings in the Salon d'Automne (1905) and the Salon des Independants (1906). It was indicative of the course Kahnweiler set for himself that he promptly got to know Matisse and began acquiring pictures by the other Fauves - Andre Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Georges Braque and Kees van Dongen - for his new gallery. Matisse, though ridiculed in the press with the others, already commanded prices that were too high for Kahnweiler to handle at that early stage of his career, and Matisse was in any case attached to an established gallery (Bernheim-Jeune). None of the others were.\n\nIt was through another German resident in Paris - the collector and writer Wilhelm Uhde, who was later to write a book titled ''Picasso and the French Tradition'' - that Kahnweiler met the artist with whom, above all others, his name would be forever linked. Pablo Picasso was then 26. He had just completed a large painting that left all of his artist friends deeply shocked. Uhde described it to Kahnweiler as ''Assyrian'' in style, and urged him to see it. Kahnweiler, who - as Mr. Assouline writes - ''knew nothing about Picasso,'' thus went to Picasso's studio to have a look at this strange ''Assyrian'' painting.\n\nIt turned out that Picasso had already paid a visit to the gallery in the Rue Vignon with Ambroise Vollard, a dealer Kahnweiler greatly respected. With that irresistible touch of malice the young dealer would soon become familiar with, Picasso immediately repeated to Kahnweiler a disparaging comment Vollard had made about him on that occasion. ''Do you know what Vollard said to me on leaving your gallery?'' Picasso asked. ''He said, 'This is a young man whose family gave him a gallery for his first communion.' '' Kahnweiler was naturally wounded by this gibe, but he (characteristically) sloughed it off. He was transfixed by the painting - ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' as it was later called.\n\n''When Kahnweiler finally saw the painting,'' Mr. Assouline writes, ''it came as a complete shock; he was astounded at first and then dazzled. He felt that something admirable, extraordinary, inconceivable had occurred. He was totally unprepared for this vision, and it stunned him. . . . It was wonderful, crazy, and monstrous at the same time, and yet moving. Without a doubt this work was completely new and important.'' For a work of art to be both new and important was already for Kahnweiler the key issue, and he had great confidence in his own judgment. The next day he returned to Picasso's studio to buy some of the paintings that were preliminary studies for ''Les Demoiselles.'' As for ''Les Demoiselles'' itself, Picasso wasn't ready to sell it and Kahnweiler wasn't then in a position to buy it. But a bond of a sort had been established between them. At the crucial moment Kahnweiler hadn't flinched. He had in fact responded with genuine excitement. Equally important, he acted upon his response with prompt cash purchases. ''Picasso was touched by his exceptional enthusiasm,'' Mr. Assouline writes. ''Kahnweiler was one of the few people to believe in him completely and absolutely at a moment when Picasso had touched bottom. . . . From that moment their fates were sealed.''",

        "text": "Jacques Derrida, the Algerian-born, French intellectual who became one of the most celebrated and notoriously difficult philosophers of the late 20th century, died Friday at a Paris hospital, the French president's office announced. He was 74.\n\nThe cause of death was pancreatic cancer, according to French television, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Derrida was known as the father of deconstruction, the method of inquiry that asserted that all writing was full of confusion and contradiction, and that the author's intent could not overcome the inherent contradictions of language itself, robbing texts -- whether literature, history or philosophy -- of truthfulness, absolute meaning and permanence. The concept was eventually applied to the whole gamut of arts and social sciences, including linguistics, anthropology, political science, even architecture.\n\nWhile he had a huge following -- larger in the United States than in Europe -- he was the target of as much anger as admiration. For many Americans, in particular, he was the personification of a French school of thinking they felt was undermining many of the traditional standards of classical education, and one they often associated with divisive political causes.\n\nLiterary critics broke texts into isolated passages and phrases to find hidden meanings. Advocates of feminism, gay rights, and third-world causes embraced the method as an instrument to reveal the prejudices and inconsistencies of Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Freud and other \"dead white male\" icons of Western culture. Architects and designers could claim to take a \"deconstructionist\" approach to buildings by abandoning traditional symmetry and creating zigzaggy, sometimes disquieting spaces. The filmmaker Woody Allen titled one of his movies \"Deconstructing Harry,\" to suggest that his protagonist could best be understood by breaking down and analyzing his neurotic contradictions.\n\nA Code Word for Discourse\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, deconstruction became a code word of intellectual discourse, much as existentialism and structuralism -- two other fashionable, slippery philosophies that also emerged from France after World War II -- had been before it. Mr. Derrida and his followers were unwilling -- some say unable -- to define deconstruction with any precision, so it has remained misunderstood, or interpreted in endlessly contradictory ways.\n\nTypical of Mr. Derrida's murky explanations of his philosophy was a 1993 paper he presented at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, in New York, which began: \"Needless to say, one more time, deconstruction, if there is such a thing, takes place as the experience of the impossible.\"\n\nMr. Derrida was a prolific writer, but his 40-plus books on various aspects of deconstruction were no more easily accessible. Even some of their titles -- \"Of Grammatology,\" \"The Postcard: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond,\" and \"Ulysses Gramophone: Hear Say Yes in Joyce\" -- could be off-putting to the uninitiated.\n\n\"Many otherwise unmalicious people have in fact been guilty of wishing for deconstruction's demise -- if only to relieve themselves of the burden of trying to understand it,\" Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at New York University, wrote in a 1994 article in The New York Times Magazine.\n\nMr. Derrida's credibility was also damaged by a 1987 scandal involving Paul de Man, a Yale University professor who was the most acclaimed exponent of deconstruction in the United States. Four years after Mr. de Man's death, it was revealed that he had contributed numerous pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic articles to a newspaper in Belgium, where he was born, while it was under German occupation during World War II. In defending his dead colleague, Mr. Derrida, a Jew, was understood by some people to be condoning Mr. de Man's anti-Semitism.\n\nNonetheless, during the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Derrida's writings and lectures gained him a huge following in major American universities -- in the end, he proved far more influential in the United States than in France. For young, ambitious professors, his teachings became a springboard to tenure in faculties dominated by senior colleagues and older, shopworn philosophies. For many students, deconstruction was a right of passage into the world of rebellious intellect.\n\nJacques Derrida was born on July 15, 1930, in El-Biar, Algeria. His father was a salesman. At age 12, he was expelled from his French school when the rector, adhering to the Vichy government's racial laws, ordered a drastic cut in Jewish enrollment. Even as a teenager, Mr. Derrida (the name is pronounced day-ree-DAH) was a voracious reader whose eclectic interests embraced the philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and the poet Paul Val\u00e9ry.\n\nBut he could be an indifferent student. He failed his baccalaureate in his first attempt. He twice failed his entrance exam to the \u00c9cole Normal Sup\u00e9rieure, the traditional cradle of French intellectuals, where he was finally admitted in 1952. There he failed the oral portion of his final exams on his first attempt. After graduation in 1956, he studied briefly at Harvard University. For most of the next 30 years, he taught philosophy and logic at both the University of Paris and the \u00c9cole Normal Sup\u00e9rieure. Yet he did not defend his doctoral dissertation until 1980, when he was 50 years old.\n\nBy the early 1960's, Mr. Derrida had made a name for himself as a rising young intellectual in Paris by publishing articles on language and philosophy in leading academic journals. He was especially influenced by the German philosophers, Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Both were strong critics of traditional metaphysics, a branch of philosophy which explored the basis and perception of reality.\n\nAs a lecturer, Mr. Derrida cultivated charisma and mystery. For many years, he declined to be photographed for publication. He cut a dashing, handsome figure at the lectern, with his thick thatch of prematurely white hair, tanned complexion, and well-tailored suits. He peppered his lectures with puns, rhymes and enigmatic pronouncements, like, \"Thinking is what we already know that we have not yet begun,\" or, \"Oh my friends, there is no friend\"\n\nMany readers found his prose turgid and baffling, even as aficionados found it illuminating. A single sentence could run for three pages, and a footnote even longer. Sometimes his books were written in \"deconstructed\" style. For example, \"Glas\" (1974) offers commentaries on the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the French novelist Jean Genet in parallel columns of the book's pages; in between, there is an occasional third column of commentary about the two men's ideas.\n\n\"The trouble with reading Mr. Derrida is that there is too much perspiration for too little inspiration,\" editorialized The Economist in 1992, when Cambridge University awarded the philosopher an honorary degree after a bruising argument among his supporters and critics on the faculty. Elsewhere in Europe, Mr. Derrida's deconstruction philosophy gained earlier and easier acceptance.\n\nMr. Derrida appeared on the American intellectual landscape at a 1966 conference on the French intellectual movement known as structuralism at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore. Its high priest was French anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, who studied societies through their linguistic structure.",

Roughly two dozen other cities have since joined the cause.\n\nIn St. Louis, for instance, local efforts are making it possible for some 6,250 teenagers to see the film for free. \u201cIt is important that St. Louis students are informed about this moment in history and its connections to the challenges they face today,\u201d Reverend Starsky Wilson, president and CEO of Deaconess Foundation, a partner in the \u201cSelma for Students\u201d campaign in the city, said via press release. \u201cWe believe this experience will nurture civic engagement among young people and give them hope that systemic change is possible through cooperative, intentional, and well-planned efforts.\u201d\n\nAltogether, it\u2019s being estimated that more than 275,000 American students around the country will be able to get free admission to the movie, with most attending over the long Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday weekend.\n\nA limited number of tickets are being given away for each theater, and as of Friday afternoon several locations were already \u201csold out,\u201d including all of New York City and Philadelphia, and all but a few of the participating Regal Cinemas around the country.

        "text": "When most people decide to upgrade their home coffee setup, they go shopping for coffee makers and often spend most or all of their budget on a shiny new machine. Perhaps on the way out of the store, they\u2019ll grab some exotic beans or a fancy package of preground coffee.\n\nUnfortunately, they haven\u2019t done the one thing they need to do to make a truly great cup.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the brewing apparatus isn\u2019t the most important tool\u2014it\u2019s the grinder, usually the weakest link in the coffee chain and the one most deserving of the biggest chunk of your budget.\n\nGrinding the beans right before you use them is the easiest thing you can do to improve the quality of your morning quaff, no matter the brewing method or type of coffee you prefer. According to the National Coffee Association\u2014not to mention anyone who\u2019s ever tried it\u2014this will make coffee taste much fresher than pre-ground, or even beans that you grind the night before. (Buying freshly roasted beans is another good idea.)\n\nBut grinding before brewing only gets you so far. For really superior results, you need the right kind of grinder. Most people settle for an inexpensive spinning-blade grinder, but a \u201cburr\u201d grinder\u2014think of a pepper mill for coffee\u2014is a vastly better choice. Unlike the spinning blade types, which create both fine dust and big chunks, the burrs grind to a uniform size, which makes for an even extraction of flavor compounds and caffeine.\n\nThe evenness of the particle sizes may not seem that important, but it has a significant effect on how your coffee tastes. When particles are small, the hot water quickly extracts the coffee flavor, caffeine, and other compounds and can easily extract too much, giving a bitter taste.\n\nOn the other hand, big, chunky particles make it hard for the hot water to take out the caffeine and flavor, which results in under-extraction and a sour taste. For people using blade grinders, these flavors often come together to create a muddy cup that\u2019s nothing more than an eye-opener.\n\nThe good news here is that a burr grinder has the potential to be a miracle cure for your morning, and will yield tremendous results regardless of the brew method. (Blue Bottle and plenty of other well-regarded coffee companies use Bonmac drippers you can buy for $12.)\n\nElectric models, the kind with genuine conical burrs (they look like this) start at around $90. According to The Sweethome, a popular and respected product review publication, you can get a really good one for $130, as long as you\u2019re not doing espresso grind, which is too fine for most machines to handle. That may seem like a lot to spend for a coffee crusher, but if you amortize the cost over years of coffee-drinking pleasure, the price may not seem so high. (And you can always buy a cheaper coffee machine.)\n\nThere is a budget option, however\u2014if you\u2019re willing to have a small workout. Non-electric burr grinders are a perfect way to get started if you want to see whether upping your grind makes a difference. At just $19, models like the Hario Coffee Mill Slim Grinder do a phenomenal job that rivals many of the electric models 10 times the price. It may take you a couple of minutes of grinding for two cups of coffee, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little exercise in the morning. For less than $20, the downside is small if you can\u2019t tell a difference, but the upside is huge. You may find that it\u2019s no longer just caffeine that wakes you up\u2014it\u2019s the anticipation of a top-notch cup of coffee.",
        "generated": "The key to making a truly great cup of coffee is not the brewing apparatus, but the grinder, which should be a burr grinder that grinds the beans right before brewing to achieve a uniform particle size for even extraction of flavor compounds and caffeine, resulting in a fresher and more flavorful cup of coffee.",

        "text": "It\u2019s a great time to be in the market for a used car. The Wall Street Journal recently cited data indicating that used-car prices declined for the four consecutive months through August. USA Today noted that the average used car purchased at a franchised auto dealership sold for $10,883 in August, down 1.6% from the previous year and 2.4% versus July 2014. Edmunds.com predicted that used car prices would dip around 2% overall this year, and that some used vehicles\u2014in particular, large crossover SUVs like the Chevy Traverse\u2014would drop in price by upwards of 8%.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the forecast calls for used-car prices to stay on a downward trend for the foreseeable future. AutoTrader.com, the Atlanta-based online marketplace for new and used vehicles, says that its inventory of certified pre-owned vehicles has risen 6% since March, and that by year\u2019s end buyers can expect a handful of top \u201cpre-loved\u201d car models\u2014including the 2011 versions of the Ford Fusion, Toyota Corolla, and Honda CR-V\u2014to be priced at roughly 5% less than what dealers were asking just six months ago.\n\nWhat accounts for the sudden price dip? A quick review of what has happened in the new and used car markets over the past few years sheds some light. In 2011, used vehicle prices hit a 16-year high in the wake of the Great Recession, when relatively few consumers were purchasing or leasing new cars because money was tight and credit was less available. That meant a shrinking supply of used cars, as there were fewer trade-ins or vehicles coming off lease. The \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d stimulus program also removed millions of used vehicles from the market, further tightening supply.\n\nAccording to Cars.com, the average 2012 listing price for five popular used vehicles five or more years old had risen a whopping 29% over the three years prior. Around that time, however, new car leases and sales surged, rising 13% in 2012 and continuing with impressive growth in 2013 and 2014. All of those new vehicle purchases and leases have translated to a parallel rise in trade-ins and cars coming off leases. \u201cLeasing has surged in recent years with thousands of those cars coming back to dealerships as used cars,\u201d Michelle Krebs, AutoTrader.com senior analyst, said via press release. \u201cThe abundance of returned lease cars should result in used cars coming off their historical highs of recent years, representing good buys for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway is that used cars are cheap, at least when compared to the record highs of a few years ago, and that the market for previously owned vehicles should remain attractive to buyers through the near future.\n\nYet this turn of events isn\u2019t all good for consumers. When used car prices tank, so does the value of your trade-in, if you have one. Also, automakers are more likely to offer low-price lease deals when their anticipated resale value is high. The flip side is that when used car prices crater, like they\u2019re doing now, car dealerships must assume that they\u2019ll be forced to sell off-lease vehicles for less money\u2014and therefore they need to make more money from the person leasing the car in the first place. In other words, typical monthly payments for a customer leasing a new car are likely to rise compared to the rates available not long ago.",

But before you let your friends drag you onto the dance floor and do the Electric Slide as atonement, consider these tips on how to make it through wedding season without spending it in the poor house.\n\nIf you\u2019ve racked up credit card rewards over the past year, or even since the holidays, now\u2019s the time to cash them in for travel if it\u2019s a destination wedding, lodging, or even gifts for the betrothed.\n\n\u201cPrepare ahead for travel expenses by stockpiling airline miles and credit card rewards which you can redeem toward a flight or hotel stay,\u201d suggests money-saving expert Andrea Woroch. \u201cYou can even gift accrued miles to the couple for their honeymoon. Otherwise, you can redeem rewards toward gift cards for the bridal shower and wedding gift.\u201d\n\nWhile I don\u2019t always advise opening a credit card just to take advantage of the sign-up perks, depending on how many weddings you\u2019re attending, and how far you\u2019re traveling, opening a new account may work in your favor \u2014 so long as you plan to pay off the balance right away and it won\u2019t adversely affect your credit score.\n\nMost of the weddings I\u2019ve attended have suggested lodging for guests, either where the bride and groom are staying or other nearby establishments if the home base has reached capacity. But these aren\u2019t your only options. If you find the suggested lodging options out of your budget, search for better deals. Check the hotel\u2019s website for exclusive discounts, or even daily deal sites like LivingSocial or Groupon. Even if you have to stay 10 miles away from the venue, saving that extra $25 or $50 per night may be worth the short drive to you. (See also: How to Stay in a 5-Star Hotel for Less Than the Cost of a Motel)\n\nSome people enjoy the privacy of hotel rooms, but personally I\u2019d rather go in with friends on a home rental via Airbnb or another short-term rental site if several of us are invited to the same wedding. Not only will you typically save a substantial amount of money over a hotel by reserving private lodging, but you can split the total cost between the group, which could make the trip a real steal. You\u2019ll save even more money on meals if the place is equipped with a kitchen you can use to make food during your stay.\n\nCan\u2019t afford a gift from the bride and groom\u2019s registry? Put your thinking cap on and come up with creative ways you can honor their marriage by offering a service.\n\n\u201cMost couples financing their wedding welcome free or a discounted service in lieu of a gift,\u201d says Woroch. \u201cSome of the most common services provided by friends and family include photography, videography, day-of makeup and hair prep, and decorating help. You can even offer to bake the wedding treat or officiate the ceremony, if the couple hasn\u2019t made other arrangements.\u201d\n\nBuying discount gift cards online is a smart tactic to save on gift purchases for any occasion. Use your saving savvy to stack deals, and you\u2019ll likely come in way under budget with plenty of cash to spare for the other wedding expenses.\n\nPersonal finance expert Kevin Gallegos offers a smart tip with regards to wedding gifts: shop early!\n\n\u201cIf invited to a wedding, find out where the couple has registered as soon as you can,\u201d he says. \u201cGo online or to the brick-and-mortar store and select a gift immediately. Shopping early assures the best selection \u2014 and one that fits your budget.\u201d\n\nWait too long and all that will be left are the crystal candelabras and $60-a-piece Kate Spade dinner plates.\n\nI have never purchased insurance for a rental car. Why? Because it\u2019s a fool\u2019s game. My own personal insurance will cover me if I\u2019m in an accident, so why do I need extra? I don\u2019t, and you don\u2019t either if you have similar coverage. Check with your provider, of course, to make sure you\u2019re covered.\n\nTravel expert Katelyn O\u2019Shaughnessy, founder of TripScope, suggests another way of getting around the insurance car rental joints try to scare you into buying.\n\n\u201cBefore you opt for the overpriced car insurance that rental companies offer, call your credit card company and see if car insurance is included. In my case, three of my credit card companies offer this little perk, which saved me $200,\u201d she says.\n\nRecently I traveled to Canada and I turned off my mobile data two minutes too late and racked up $20 in extra charges by using navigation. O\u2019Shaughnessy says you can nip that in the bud by using Google Maps offline by typing \u201cOK Maps,\u201d and the map will save for future, offline access.\n\nRead More: 6 Money Myths About Stay-At-Home Moms\n\nMen have it easy when it comes to dressing for a wedding. Just throw on that one suit you own, swap out different ties for different events, and you\u2019re all set. Nobody will ever notice. Women, however, have it rough when dressing for a wedding. For starters, you can\u2019t show up the bride or the bridesmaid in a stunning ensemble or you\u2019ll be shunned. Secondly, if you show up in a memorable dress, you likely won\u2019t want to wear it to another wedding if it\u2019s attended by any of the same people. Frequent wedding guest Emily Taffel has a solution to that problem: Be boring. (See also: How to Attend a Wedding for Cheap (Without Actually Looking Cheap))\n\n\u201cNever buy a printed dress to wear to a wedding; prints are remembered. Dresses aren\u2019t if they are boring enough,\u201d she says. \u201cI say that dearly, but every woman knows a navy shift dress in a perfect fit will take you everywhere. Accessories make all the difference \u2014 scarves, hats, the right handbag, shoes, and jewelry. That navy dress works day and night and saves you having to buy multiple outfits.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make the wedding for some reason, and your plans have changed less than 72 hours in advance, there\u2019s a way around forfeiting the deposit you put on the hotel, even if it is a bit shady.\n\n\u201cJust reschedule for a future date \u2014 usually there\u2019s no monetary penalty for that \u2014 then call the hotel back, get a different rep and cancel free of charge,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy advises.\n\nListen, if you can\u2019t afford to attend all the weddings to which you\u2019re invited, it\u2019s okay to say no. I\u2019ve already declined one wedding invitation for this summer in San Francisco because I recently came back from a three-week stay in California, and the timing wasn\u2019t right for my budget. If the bride and groom are reasonable, they\u2019ll understand. If not, well, it\u2019ll be two less jerks you\u2019ll have to worry about in the future, because you\u2019ll be dead to them from here or out.\n\nAs an alternative, perhaps you can make it to one or more of the events leading up to the wedding to show your support.",

        "text": "Surround sound \u2026 Haroon Mirza's Adam, Eve and a UFO (2013). Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Lisson Gallery\n\nOften, I dance alone in my flat. How sad is that, you say, but I don't care. Feeling the beats pulsing through me, being taken over by dark rhythms or a voice, I sometimes fall over the furniture. Which is why I didn't risk dancing in Haroon Mirza's exhibition at the Lisson Gallery \u2013 though the whumffs and thuds beating around a circle of eight speakers in the upstairs gallery, all pointing inward, proved almost irresistible.\n\nA column of sound rose in the centre of the space. I wanted to be there, surrounded, but there was too much stuff in the way: the foam sound-baffles on the walls, the speakers on the floor, the \"UFO circuit\" (I have no idea what a UFO is in electronic terms, but it looks pretty with its pulsing lights) and all the cables festooned about the place crowded me out. Following the aural conversation criss-crossing the room from speaker to speaker (each one different) made me feel I was in some swanky hi-fi studio, being given a demo of the system that's right for me.\n\nLet's try the reverberation chamber instead, a shiny, all-white room. Clap your hands and the echo is a hard and immediate ricochet. A panel speaker hangs from the ceiling and a tubular LED light leans casually against a wall. The light comes on and off, but it is nothing like Martin Creed's famous work. I was alone in there, except for an ant. I only saw it for a moment before the light went out. It looked stunned. Perhaps it was dead.\n\nWhen the light comes on, it is accompanied by a shushing sound that gets louder as the light dies away to darkness. We are left in an abrupt silence that reminded me of Beckett's Breath. When the light came on again the ant was still there, an inert speck on a glass ledge inside something like an old-fashioned paraffin lamp, or perhaps a crack pipe, on the floor. It is an ant farm. When an ant wanders over a copper plate inside, the pitter-pattering of its miniscule feet is mixed in with the sound of water: something like rain, or the noise inside a shower. That's what we hear when the light comes on.\n\nI stayed in there for a long time, bemused. Then later, on the street, looking in through the window, I saw the exterior shell of Mirza's chamber in a sealed off part of the gallery. A showerhead has been plumbed into the wall, gushing water into a plastic dustbin. A microphone relays the noise of the shower into the chamber, along with the ants' footfalls. That's the sound you hear when the light comes on.\n\nOriginally, this peculiar work had the title Pavilion for a Beautiful Nuisance. This has now been changed to Pavilion for Optimisation. Ant noises; water; reverb. Is this a kind of found and manipulated music? It is the sound of something approaching as the light fades away. The reverb in the room makes me feel exposed.\n\nIn another part of the gallery stands an array of turntables, the needles juddering over various doctored vinyl and handmade records, all played by an invisible DJ. One turntable has been adapted to set off electronic wails, like a bird calling from high up in a jungle canopy. You'd go mad if you had to listen all day, and the whole thing has a doomy, repetitive beat. Amid it all is a recorded voice, from far away and long ago.\n\nIn 1969, the American minimalist composer Alvin Lucier sat alone in a room, and recorded a brief statement: \"I am sitting in a room, different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed \u2026\" Lucier played back his voice, rerecorded it and played it back again. He repeated the process until his voice became a quivering abstract resonance equivalent in sound to the room itself. Lucier had a slight speech impediment; I Am Sitting in a Room was an attempt to smooth out his own speech defects. You can hear him hesitating over the word rhythm. It sounds like he is speaking from inside an echo chamber, or his words are being manipulated by a DJ. There's a clue here to the whole of Mirza's show.\n\nMirza has remixed Lucier's recording, compounding the composer's degenerated voice with the other sounds in the gallery: the beats of a needle bouncing over tape glued to a record, a long foghorn boom from another prepared disc. This is Lucier, the dubstep remix. I tried dancing, but the tempo made me feel like a slow-mo zombie on downers.\n\nOn a website dedicated to this show are a number of fascinating essays about Mirza's work. David Toop on insects, architecture, gamelan and frog choruses, and much besides. Art critic Ossian Ward on DJing is also particularly good. Mirza is a DJ too. You can be one as well, because the website features a number of samples from which you can mix your own music and upload it via SoundCloud and on to the website. Jellyman from the band Django Django has already made a version.\n\nMirza's work is doing the rounds. He crops up everywhere \u2013 he has another show opening at the Hepworth in Wakefield this week. It is much more than a case of plug it in and turn it on. He's a sampler and a remixer, a scratch DJ of minimalist art and music, of John Cage and dub reggae soundsystems, a rethinker of bricolage and old-fashioned avant garde audio experiment. Mirza might be a bit of an equipment fetishist, but you've got to love the stuff you use. As much as he quotes, he reinvents. Isn't that something art, and music, literature and dance, always does? Just about able to set up a hi-fi system myself, my appreciation of decks and speakers, or the finer points of the turntablist's art, are barely minimal. Just spin me a few platters and I'll have a go.",

        "text": "An almost believable view \u2026 Jules de Balincourt's High and Low, Photograph: Jules de Balincourt/Victoria Miro Gallery\n\nThe day has a holiday air. People are out on their rooftops or standing about on patches of green. I can't tell what time of day it is \u2013 let's say the afternoon \u2013 or the season; the soft sunlight and hazy distance, where unending buildings rise in the thickening sky, make me think of late summer or early autumn. That was the time of year the painting was finished, so maybe something of the world crept into the Brooklyn studio where Jules de Balincourt painted High and Low, completing the large group of paintings now at Victoria Miro Gallery.\n\nHigh and Low is filled with the kind of modern, aspirational shoebox architecture you find everywhere; a ubiquitous banality hemming diminutive bits of 19th-century Greek revival \u2013 a stray townhouse and a distant set of steps that seem to lead nowhere. Here and there the cityscape gets fudged. It is a world unfinished, or about to give up on itself. At points the perspective goes astray, the buildings warping out of alignment. Some of the figures don't seem quite solid, either, or have forgotten to bring their shadows with them. At one point, the sky abandons its pretence, and you can see the whirls and knots of the plywood panel on which it was painted. It is like The Truman Show.\n\nThis is something we often care not to remember when we look at a painting. We know the birds are just ticks of paint and the world is just smears and blobs on a sheet of board, or a bit of cloth stretched over a frame and fastened there with cheap industrial staples or a row of carpet tacks. You'd be an idiot not to acknowledge the something and nothing that is a painting, but even more of a fool to reduce it to bare material fact. The world is always about to fall apart, and us with it, so it's best to acknowledge the happenstance miracle of being alive.\n\nPerhaps that is what is happening here, in this almost believable view, where people have gathered, going about their day or ranged on the rooftops in watery light, looking at something we can't fathom. Maybe everyone is waiting for something to happen. They seem to be looking towards the small park, but there isn't much going on down there. There's a very big statue of a man with a cane, dwarfing the strollers, and what seems to be a picnic. Kids play, couples walk. We are either too early or too late, which leaves us free to let our eyes wander.\n\nHigh and Low would make a good jigsaw or drawing for a New Yorker cover. It's the sort of painting you can project yourself into, losing yourself in this painted day. This is an unsophisticated sort of pleasure, but one I never wholly tire of. Children like to lose themselves in pictures like this. You imagine the lives people live there, and get distracted as you look. You could call it escapism but you always re-find yourself inside the labyrinth of looking, thinking and daydreaming. Looking is a beginning as much as an end in itself.\n\nAll these windows in all these buildings remind me of a nativity calendar. Each one is itself like a little painting. Some show us the corner of a room, the ones further away as abstract as a Kazimir Malevich work. Oddly, the little dun-coloured interior views in the nearer buildings remind me of some early paintings by Luc Tuymans. Nothing much happens in them, either.\n\nThese fragmentary internal views incite our curiosity and voyeurism. I stay on the lookout for someone dressing or having a row or pressed up against the window having a bit of wild sex, as they do in Steve McQueen's film Shame. But they don't, or I haven't found them yet. They'd just be blobs anyway. I feel like Jimmy Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, or Gene Hackman in Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 thriller The Conversation. Looking becomes bugging, a kind of god-like act of surveillance. The more you look, the more there is to see, but the anomalies of this world become even more insistent, as if the fiction can't sustain itself. The unreliable narrator becomes the unreliable painter.\n\nJules de Balincourt's paintings are not very consistent. There are big ones and little ones, crowded ones and empty ones, paintings filled with figures and others that appear almost entirely abstract. Sometimes he paints explosions, but they're sort of benign and cartoonish, opening like jazzy flowers. He paints views and people and maps and words, pretty much always on birch panels using thin oils. There's one piece showing a man sticking something in a bin; and there's a cursory portrait of Chelsea Manning, hung high on the wall, as though removed from the rest of the world.\n\nBut most paintings have groups of people in them, some seen close up, others far away: people sitting in a tree, people watching, sleeping or sitting around in the shade. Every painting has its own atmosphere, its own timbre. There are all degrees of depiction, just as there are different flaws, fault lines and blind spots. Things that have been painted out grin through the layers, like the smile of the Cheshire cat.\n\nOften de Balincourt starts in one place and ends in another, working on a large number of paintings at once. He doesn't draw and he rarely uses photographs or other source material. Ideas migrate from painting to painting, as if he were telling himself a story. He likes to let things fall apart, and to let the half-said or the inarticulate have their stumbling say. Viewing his work is like stumbling on the kerb or catching a snatch of half-heard conversation. Somehow, these moments make his paintings more believable, less smooth, carrying more of the texture of the day. It wouldn't work in any other medium.",

        "text": "All her life, Kitty Godley sat for portraits. When she was a child she was drawn by her father, the sculptor Jacob Epstein, while as a young bride her haunting beauty was recorded in several paintings by her first husband, Lucian Freud. In old age a triple portrait of Kitty, who has died aged 84, by Andrew Tift won the 2006 BP portrait award.\n\nThe Freud pictures \u2013 Girl With a White Dog (1951-52), in the Tate collection, perhaps the loveliest and least unsettling of them \u2013 show a dreamy, rather frightened-looking Kitty, narrow browed and wide-eyed. Like many admirers of these pictures, I had always imagined that the artist had exaggerated the size of his subject's eyes. When I first met Kitty, while researching a book about her mother's family, the Garmans, I was taken aback to discover that her eyes really were that big. Kitty gave an impression of great fragility and delicacy, with her soft, rather tremulous voice and slender, elegant hands, but there was also a hint of steeliness.\n\nKitty was born into high bohemia, the second child of Epstein's lover Kathleen Garman. The sculptor had a wife and child across London, while Kathleen lived in an unheated studio in Bloomsbury with one of her many sisters and an infant son. Such conditions were thought inimical to the raising of a family, and Kitty was sent to live with her maternal grandmother, Margaret, in Herefordshire. A younger sister, Esther, was later dispatched to a family retainer.\n\nMargaret and her faithful companion, the former governess Toni Thomas, instilled a lifelong love of books and nature, while Kitty's wild and ravishing young aunts Lorna and Ruth became her mentors. Kitty used to watch from the window of her bedroom while her aunts danced the Charleston barefoot on the lawn in the summer dusk.\n\nLorna married in her teens and then became the lover of Laurie Lee, breaking up with him when she began an affair with the young Freud. Both men went on to marry nieces of Lorna's. Kitty was to have two daughters by Freud, but the marriage ended in the early 1950s when Freud met Lady Caroline Blackwood, who was to become his second wife. Lorna retained an influence over her niece, who followed her into the Roman Catholic church.\n\nKitty had stayed on with Margaret when the household moved to South Harting, Sussex, only joining her mother in London in her late teens when she took up a place at the Central School of Arts and Crafts to study painting under Bernard Meninsky. Kathleen was highly critical of her daughter. \"I think she wanted her daughters to excel,\" Kitty recalled, \"but she didn't want us to succeed, because she had to be the queen. I was frightened of her because of her temper and she did say searingly sarcastic things.\"\n\nThus discouraged, only in later life did Kitty venture to paint and draw again: delicate still-life pencil studies of plants and wild flowers, and small, exquisite paintings. An exhibition of her work, Kitty Garman and Co, was held in 2004 at the New Art Gallery in Walsall, West Midlands, home to the Garman Ryan Collection, which includes important work by Epstein as well as Modigliani, Picasso and many others. Kitty's pictures were displayed alongside work by her daughters, Annie and Annabel, and her granddaughter May Cornet. The show brought her tremendous happiness.\n\nKitty's brother Theo had suffered from mental health problems and died in distressing circumstances in 1954, aged 29. Later that year, Esther took her own life. In later years Kitty often recounted the story of Epstein's wife having shot Kathleen with a pearl-handled revolver. In Kitty's imagination this event had occurred while Kathleen was pregnant with her. In reality the shooting happened three years earlier, but her reconfiguring of the date contained an important truth. Kitty, however vulnerable, was a survivor. Of her mother's children, she was the only one to attain old age.\n\nHer second marriage, in 1955, brought new joy. Her husband was the startlingly handsome Wynne Godley (younger son of Lord Kilbracken), immortalised by Epstein as the figure of Saint Michael spearing the devil in the sculpture at Coventry Cathedral. An oboist whose chronic stage fright necessitated a change of career, Wynne turned to economics, becoming professor of applied economics at Cambridge University. With Wynne, Kitty had a daughter, Eve, and created lovely houses, first in London, then in Denmark and upstate New York, and lastly at Cavendish in Suffolk.\n\nKitty's was a nervous disposition, but her house was an oasis of calm, full of buttercups in old glass jars, William Morris wallpaper, glossy wood, shells, tapestries and mirrors. Tea was served in paper-thin china. Art and books mattered. She loved the Italian renaissance painter Carlo Crivelli (one of whose Madonnas she resembled), Henri Fantin-Latour, Henry James and, above all, Proust.\n\nKitty had a great freshness and originality of outlook, always forming judgments of her own. These were sometimes eccentric, always apt. She was highly observant and there were flashes of wit, well demonstrated in her long letters. She was modest, loyal and kind. Annie Freud (whose poetry collection, The Mirabelles, is currently shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize) describes her mother as a woman of accoutrements, narrow ankled, wearing fine calf-skin and smelling of lemon-scented cologne. The dementia of her final years did not diminish her gentle sweetness.\n\nWynne died in 2010. Kitty is survived by her daughters.\n\nWilliam Keegan writes: Kitty never took to air travel. During the long period in the 1990s when her husband was at the Levy Economic Institute in upper New York state, the two of them would cross the Atlantic on cargo boats. One fondly remembered instance of her extreme nervous sensibility was the occasion when Wynne delivered the university sermon (on economics and the public weal, not religion) at King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and the provost, the philosopher Bernard Williams, held a picnic afterwards. It was an idyllic summer day, but the occasion was too idyllic for Kitty. \"This is too beautiful,\" she declared out of the blue. \"I just have to leave.\" She duly departed in the middle of lunch.\n\n\u2022 Kathleen Eleonora Godley, artist and muse, born 27 August 1926; died 11 January 2011",

The Wea\u00adther Bureau said winds of 115\u00adm.p.h. and higher could be ex\u00adpected after the eye passed.\n\nBrunswick, Ga., about 60 miles north of here, took a severe beating from.the massive storm, whose hurricane\u2010force winds\u2014more than 75 miles an hour\u2014ex\u00adtended 125 miles from its center.\n\nGales lashed the rest of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Hurricane warnings were up all the way to Charles\u00adton, S. C.\n\nWinds that reached a peak of 95 miles an hour and crashing waves wrecked seaside build\u00adings, flattened billboards, crum\u00adbled seawalls, ripped open piers and uprooted trees on the Flori\u2010da coast.\n\nAluminum light poles weaved, loose wires crackled and shin\u00adgles peeled off by the thousands. Ninety\u2010two per cent of Jack\u00adsonville was reported without electricity.\n\nRoofs of two motels in Bruns\u00adwick were badly ripped. The roof of another building was blown off. Windows were smashed. Debris littered the city's streets. Most of the power was out.\n\nGreat green arcs flashed in the darkness as power lines snapped and transformers blew.\n\nAfter wallowing off Florida's northeast coast for hours, the hurricane's large eye headed straight for St. Augustine push\u00ading a 10\u2010foot tide. The high tide was expected to spread far up the Georgia coast.\n\nThe Weather Bureau said the storm was headed generally to the west at seven miles an hour. It was expected to turn north\u00adward, then northwestward. That would take the hurricane and its predicted rains of up to 15 inches into southern Georgia.\n\nModerate to severe flooding was expected.\n\nWhitecaps raced down the narrow streets of 400\u2010year\u2010old St. Augustine, the nation's old\u00adest city. Water flowed hip\u2010deep at the ancient Slave Market Square, in the heart of the busi\u00adness district, the scene of racial violence this summer.\n\nWaves broke over what was left of the seawall at Jackson\u00adville Beach and rolled through the streets. An oceanfront beer and sandwich shop was de\u00adstroyed.\n\nAt least three structures were unroofed. Three others were un\u00addermined by waves.\n\nA palm tree was pitched through the front of a seaside restaurant. Waves threw debris into a tavern, crumbling its front.\n\nVirtually all power and most telephones were out. Residents who stayed in their, homes sat in darkness.\n\nNeither Jacksonville nor St. Augustine had ever been struck by the full force of a storm as big as the hurricane Dora, which was churning 200,000 square miles of sea, an area larger than New York and Cali\u00adfornia combined.\n\nIn St. Augustine, Charles Walker, Red Cross disaster chairman, called the hurricane \u201cthe most disastrous storm we've ever had.\u201d\n\nOld buildings being restored to their 16th\u2010century appearance were cut off by standing water. The Castillo de San Marcos, the oldest Spanish fort in the Unit\u00aded States, was surrounded by flood waters.\n\nIn front of the Monson Motor Lodge, where the Rev. Dr. Mar\u00adtin Luther King Jr. concen\u00adtrated his integration drive, water ran hubcap deep.\n\nOn the beachside, Tommy Cox, 69 years old, owner of the St. Augustine Beach Hotel, re\u00adported that waves had smashed through ground floors and \u201care pouring through my lobby.\u201d Most of the 3,000 other persons on the low\u2010lying peninsula had fled as the storm approached, but Mr. Cox elected to ride it out.\n\nSuspense had built up among coastal residents during yester\u00adday as the hurricane, expected ashore hours earlier, slowed to an eight\u2010mile\u2010an\u2010hour forward movement and then stalled. Civil Defense officials said 50,000 persons fled the Florida coastal area in the storm's path.\n\nSeas grew wild all along the Georgia coast and thousands of persons streamed out of ex\u00adposed homes near the beaches.\n\nLong before the first winds of the hurricane reached the shore, the storm had been blamed indirectly for three deaths.\n\nTwo fliers died when a plane they had intended to fly out of the storm's path crashed on take\u2010off from the Sanford Naval Air Station in Florida. A man disappeared and was presumed to have drowned while trying to retrieve a boat blowin loose from its mooring at Brunswick.\n\nThe resort city of Daytona Beach, Fla., expecting the full fury of the storm, escaped with an estimated $20,000 damage as the highest winds passed 100 miles offshore. Tides under\u00admined seawalls and ripped away parts of two piers.\n\nFor the second time in less than a month, Cape Kennedy, the missile center, had braced for a blow that did not come. The hurricane named Cleo had hit only lightly at the center, and the present storm could muster only 56\u2010mile\u2010an\u2010hour gusts at ground level as it passed offshore.\n\nWinds of 94 miles an hour\n\nThe Weather Bureau said the seas were \u201cphenomenal\u201d and were rapidly eroding the beaches.\n\nThe Red Cross said more than 200 disaster workers were on the job or on the way to coastal areas of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.\n\nAs the hurricane struck, President Johnson declared nine counties on Florida's lower east coast a major disaster area because of damage done by its predecessor, a hurricane desig\u00adpredecessor, Cleo.\n\nOut in the Atlantic, still an\u00adother hurricane, Ethel, remained almost stationary 350 miles south\u2010southeast of Bermuda.\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form.

        "text": "'This is one of those projects that is trying to do an awful lot for an area that needs moving along' ... the National Waterfront Museum. Photograph: James Brittain\n\nWales claims to have been \"the world's first industrial nation\". If the number of museums relating to Wales' industrial heritage is any measure, it has now become the world's most advanced post-industrial state. You'd expect a substantial amount of industry to be on display in institutions such as Cardiff's Museum of Welsh Life, but there are also national museums dedicated to coal mining, woollen and slate industries, plus numerous decommissioned industrial sites that have been converted into heritage parks and the like. Perhaps in some future museum of 21st-century Welsh life, there'll be an exhibition about the current craze for museum building.\n\nNow we have the new \u00a330m National Waterfront Museum, which opens in Swansea tomorrow, and aims to tell \"Wales's story of industry and innovation\". It sounds like the last thing the country needs, but this new institution is a welcome arrival. That's partly because it combines two existing facilities - Cardiff's Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum, and Swansea's Maritime and Industrial Museum, thus reducing the total number of museums - but primarily because it is a piece of quality architecture in Wales's second city.\n\nSwansea could certainly do with an image makeover. The Lonely Planet guide described it as \"an ashtray of a place\", the movie Twin Town called it \"a pretty shitty city\", and even native son Dylan Thomas damned it as \"a graveyard of ambition\". In the post-industrial world, the city's most notable export has been Catherine Zeta Jones. Added to which, the flag-waving structures of recent years - Richard Rogers's Welsh National Assembly, the Wales Millennium Centre, and the Millennium Stadium - have all gone to Cardiff. Scarred by heavy industry and second world war bombing, much of Swansea is a jumble of old industrial buildings, decaying modern office blocks and cheap new commercial buildings resembling giant Travelodges. Despite its location on a beautiful bay, it's often difficult to guess the city is anywhere near the sea. Even in the former dockyards to the south, where the National Waterfront Museum is located, a 1970s housing development completely blocks the view to Swansea Bay. The \"waterfront\" of the title refers to a basin 100m inland.\n\n\"I hate the phrase 'catalyst for regeneration', but this is one of those projects that is trying to do an awful lot for an area that needs moving along,\" says Martin Knight of architects Wilkinson Eyre, best known for their acclaimed \"winking\" Millennium Bridge in Gateshead. That Stirling prize-winning project has become the symbol of a rejuvenated Tyneside, and Wilkinson Eyre's presence here, in another post-industrial port city, suggests Swansea is ready for its own \"Gateshead effect\". There is even another striking Wilkinson Eyre footbridge - the Swansea Sail Bridge - just around the corner from the new museum. \"You probably haven't got enough to make a quarter or a district like they did there, but there's a framework you can build on,\" says Knight. \"The main thing is to make a new heart for this area that will tie into the existing building stock.\"\n\nThe former Swansea Maritime and Industrial Museum occupied a two-storey brick warehouse alongside the basin. This area was once a rail yard, but in recent times it has been a huge car park serving the leisure centre next door - a hulking 1970s box now closed for refurbishment. Echoing the goods carriages that once pulled through here, the new section of the museum adds a curving series of four interlocked steel and glass cubes, peeling away from the warehouse building. Joining the old and new components together is a glazed internal street that forms an axis running from the basin, through the museum and its grounds, and back into the city centre. The architects have tried to forge a direct connection between the city and the sea with this new axis. If someone were to demolish the 1970s houses across the basin, the job would be complete. \"We've done the best we possibly can,\" says Knight.\n\nApproaching the museum along this new route, the translucent boxes hardly feel like a spectacular climax - some have even compared them uncharitably to a business park - but it was more important to build a flexible, practical building than a local icon, say the architects, especially for a museum concerned with industry.\n\nThe facade looking away from the city, however, is more of a show-stealer. It is clad in heavy Welsh slate - vertical slices of it arranged in irregular horizontal bands that imitate the glass on the other side. It has become almost a cliche to use slate as shorthand for Welshness - the new Welsh National Assembly and the Wales Millennium Centre also bring out the Welsh slate, the former as a heavy plinth, the latter in a sort of dry-stone wall pastiche - but this is arguably the most successful. The effect is contemporary but warm. Set off by aluminium channels between them, the slate panels' colour and surface textures change with variations in the light and weather.\n\n\"We wanted to use the widest variety of Welsh quarries we could,\" Knight explains, \"and make this really representative, but in the end we could only find two that could deal with the logistics of the programme and the budget. Part of the problem was that smaller suppliers are geared more towards doing headstones.\"\n\nOn the inside, the architecture takes a back seat to the exhibitions, which were created by specialists Land Design. As you'd expect, there are a few big pieces of machinery, but the museum's emphasis is more on the social history of industrial Wales. There is no single point of entry, but it is hoped visitors will be led up a giant new staircase to the first floor of the old warehouse. Here, the displays begin with a wall-sized live panorama of the city, followed by an interactive exhibit based on the 1851 census (the first to show that industrial workers outnumbered agricultural workers, and the basis of the \"first industrial nation\" claim).\n\nThe route then opens out into the main volume of the old warehouse, which has been stripped back as far as possible to reveal the original roof structure, before winding across a mezzanine bridge into the new building, and down to the open hall housing the big machines (tilt hammers, steam engines and the like). Here, Wilkinson Eyre's expertise with bridges pays off; the heavy steel elements supporting the external glass complement the exhibits. Lastly, there is a separate and rather forlorn little room projecting the industrial narrative into the future with some virtual exhibits on Wales's new growth industries, such as nanotechnology and renewable energy.\n\nIf there's one lesson the millennial rush of new museums has hammered home, particularly those that have failed after a couple of years, it's that the numbers have to add up, both in terms of visitors and revenue. Whatever it brings to the city and its people, the National Waterfront Museum (which will be free to all visitors) must also generate cash to stay alive. Perhaps it's not even accurate to describe such a building as a museum. Most of the old warehouse building's ground floor is given over to commercial space: a museum shop and caf\u00e9 inside, plus units for external bars and restaurants that will come into life after the school coach trips have gone home. It is also hoped that the grand upstairs gallery of the warehouse will double as a venue for the hosting of corporate events. The display cases are designed to slide back to the perimeter of the room on rollers, creating space for a 200-person banquet. So as much as cataloguing the past, this is a museum that might point Swansea towards the future. If the end result is a revitalised cultural destination for the city, the slurs about ashtrays and graveyards could become history too.",

Sears CEO Eddie Lampert is also its top shareholder\u2014his hedge fund ESL Investments owns 48.5% of shares.\n\nChief Financial Officer Rob Schriesheim said in a statement that if this happened, \u201cwe would realize substantial proceeds from such sale, which would further enhance our liquidity.\u201d\n\nThe potential move to extract cash out of its real estate is Sears\u2019 latest move to improve its finances in recent months, especially important ahead of the holiday season when it needs to reassure suppliers it can pay them. In October, it announced plans to lease space in some of its stores to fast-fashion company Primark as well as plans to raise $625 million in a debt rights and warrants offering. Prior to that, the retailer, which also owns the Kmart discount chain, announced plans to sell most of its stake in Sears Canada. All told those recent moves were expected to generate about $2 billion in cash by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nDeclining sales in recent years has led to a cash hemorrhage for Sears, which has closed dozens of stores in recent years.\n\nREITs must have most of their assets and revenue tied to real estate and pay out 90% of their taxable income as dividends, but generally don\u2019t pay corporate taxes, making them tantalizing for companies. REITs were established in 1960 to give individuals an easy way to invest in income-producing real estate.\n\nSears\u2019 move has a promising precedent: department store rival Dillard\u2019s DDS saw its shares skyrocket in 2011 after it announced its plans to create a REIT. Shares for Sears were up on Friday morning.\n\nSears\u2019 real estate portfolio is one of its most attractive assets. If it goes ahead with the REIT, Sears Holdings would own between 400 and 500 stores and lease between 1,300 and 1,400 stores.\n\nThe prospect of a REIT was welcome news for Sears investors as the retailer again reported poor, though at least stabilizing, quarterly results: for the third quarter, the company expects an U.S. adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of between $275 million and $325 million, while comparable sales should be down 0.1%, with a small rise at Kmart almost enough to offset at Sears\u2019 U.S. stores.",

Defense is something you can control better than offense. For our team to be totally committed to being a great defensive team, (it) will take us the furthest we can go.\"\n\nHis players say they've taken the lessons to heart en route to a 32-3 record heading into Saturday's game.\n\nWhat was senior point guard T.J. McConnell's prime takeaway?\n\n\"How close they were as a team,\" McConnell said. \"He wanted our team to be like that. We've watched it so many times that we're pretty much like that. We kind of figured it out as they kept talking about how close they were and what they would do for each other. We said to ourselves we have to be like that.\"\n\nSuccess didn't come easily or overnight for the Bad Boy Pistons. They had to get past the reigning powers of the time, the Celtics in the East and the Lakers in West. After several years of knocking on the door, the Chuck Daly-coached Pistons won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990.\n\nIt's a journey that Arizona can relate to -- the Wildcats have twice been one basket away from the Final Four during Miller's tenure but have yet to take that big step.\n\n\"How Coach (Miller) viewed it was we have been knocking on the door of a Pac-12 championship and the Final Four,\" said Ryan Reynolds, Arizona's director of basketball operations. \"Our program, like the Pistons, has to break down some doors.\"\n\nMiller first showed the tape last summer -- initially to his returning players, then to his entire team. They've watched it at least four times, enough to have broken down some parts into segments to illustrate points.\n\nChief among them are the staples of a championship team: Defense and rebounding.\n\n\"(That) was the backbone of their team,\" said Arizona assistant coach Joe Pasternack. \"Everybody had a certain role on the team, and everybody had to accept that role.\"\n\nIsiah Thomas was the leader. That's McConnell.\n\nBill Laimbeer was the enforcer. Kaleb Tarczewski, though lacking Laimbeer's mean streak, plays that role for the Wildcats.\n\nMark Aguirre, the scorer, comes in the form of freshman Stanley Johnson.\n\nAnd Rondae Hollis-Jefferson plays defense like Dennis Rodman and has the personality of John Salley.\n\n\"In that aspect, as far as being the hustle guy, diving on the floor for a loose ball, having energy, I would say, 'yeah,' \" Hollis-Jefferson said, agreeing with the Rodman comparison.\n\n\"Know your role,\" he said. \"If you think about it, in a way, we're like them because we have so many situations, so many places where we didn't break through. They (Pistons) were getting closer and closer every time. Eventually they broke through.\n\n\"It's time to break through.\"\n\nTarczewski added three points: Playing with heart, being physical and being unafraid.\n\n\"It was about being all in and playing hard basketball,\" he said. \"That was the most important thing. They were a team, and everyone was playing their hardest, doing everything they could to win. That's what we're trying to do.\n\n\"They were a family. Everyone was trying to win. That's what he was trying to tell us. It was good for us. It provided our team a lot of motivation.\"\n\nFor Johnson, the prevailing message was one of toughness, to be the \"baddest boys\" on the court.\n\n\"We're not going to get punked, not going to back down from anybody,\" Johnson said. \"It's not about how big or tough you are. We're going to show you -- and not by fist fighting -- but how we crash the glass and how we play offense and defense.\n\n\"If we lose, we're going to lose the right way, doing our thing. That's the mentality how this team works. That's what (Miller) was getting at.\"\n\nFollow Steve Rivera on Twitter",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 The Chinese government\u2019s announcement last week that growth for 2011 slowed only slightly to a still impressive 9.2% was greeted enthusiastically by the world\u2019s stock markets. Investors also remain buoyant on China\u2019s future. They appear to be buying the official line that the gigantic property price bubble is gradually and smoothly deflating, posing little risk to an engine that\u2019s so crucial to the future of global trade.\n\nBut the math tells a different story. The housing frenzy has driven prices so high, so fast, that a crash on the scale of the real estate collapse in Japan in the 1990s is a virtual certainty. And China\u2019s already exaggerated official growth rate could take a pounding, all the way to the zone of the unthinkable, into the low single-digits.\n\nFor this analysis, I\u2019ll borrow heavily from my former professor and mentor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, Robert Aliber. Affectionately known to his students by his initials \u201cRZA,\u201d Aliber is now retired to New Hampshire, but he writes a superb newsletter for his friends and clients. He spotted the reckless credit expansion, huge trade deficits and asset bubbles that now haunt both the U.S. and European economies long before most experts.\n\nAs Aliber puts it, \u201cIn China, the housing boom is a far bigger source of growth than is widely recognized, and it\u2019s totally unsustainable.\u201d\n\nChina can\u2019t grow its way out of a European recession\n\nAliber got his first clue that the craze spelled disaster from a former student living in Beijing. The young Chicago alumnus told Aliber that he\u2019d just moved into an apartment building with several hundred units, and was the only one living there. Investors had bought all the other apartments that hadn\u2019t sold.\n\nLater that year, Aliber visited the office of an upscale developer in Beijing, who was getting $600,000 for 1100 square foot units with bare walls. The folks doing the purchasing were earning between $20,000 and $30,000. Given those modest incomes, it was obvious that the buyers weren\u2019t purchasing an affordable new residence, but speculating in real estate, either to live there for awhile then flip the unit, or simply leave it vacant while seeking a buyer willing to hand them quick windfall.\n\nWhat amazed Aliber was the chasm between the prices of the apartments and the rents they fetched. A typical $600,000 unit brought a landlord less than $1000 a month in rent after expenses (assuming no mortgage). It wasn\u2019t the rental yields that attracted investors, it was the huge price appreciation, averaging from 20% to 30% from 2008 until last year.\n\nRents \u2014 the cost of living in the unit \u2014 exercise a sort of gravitational pull on prices. That\u2019s because people won\u2019t pay far more to own a home than to rent a similar one, unless they think prices will keep soaring \u2014 a view that\u2019s a sure sign of casino mentality, and never lasts. In China, prices in the frothiest markets are fifty or sixty time rents. That\u2019s the case with the example we discussed above, where the price is $600,000, and the rent is $12000, a ratio of 50-to-1. The 50 to 60 multiple is far above the level in most U.S. markets at the height of the bubble in 2006; in those heady days, a multiple of 40 was considered giant.\n\nSo how far do China\u2019s prices need to fall so that the cost of owning is reasonably close to the level of rents? Aliber reckons that the rental yield on apartments will eventually go from less than 2% to 5%, or even a bit higher.\n\nThe rental yield is simply the annual rent divided by the market price, just as the yield on a bond is the fixed interest payment divided by the price of the bond that day. In the U.S., the rental yield averages around 6%, meaning the multiple of prices to rents is around 17. The adjustment to a 5% rental yield in China would push prices down by 60%.\n\n15 business people who\u2019ve changed China\n\nAliber is by no means the sole China expert to predict that a steep drop is coming. \u201cI estimate that a decline of 60% or even more is the upper end of the range, but is indeed possible,\u201d says Derek Scissors, an economist at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe adjustment has already begun. While the government\u2019s official figures show modest declines starting late last year, those numbers are famously unreliable. A better view comes from owners trying to sell their units. Losses of 30% aren\u2019t uncommon. In fact, many owners who paid, say, $600,000 in 2010 are furious that their landlords are now offering unsold units in the same building for $450,000.\n\nWhat\u2019s the probable hit to China\u2019s vaunted growth rate? It\u2019s important to recap the forces that caused the frenzy. China imposes tight restrictions on returns on bank accounts, government bond yields and other domestic investments. Inflation for 2011 exceeded 5%, but 10-year bond yields are just 3.5%. It\u2019s extremely difficult to find investments that yield more than inflation. When the easy money policies took charge after the worldwide crash of 2008, the excess cash flowed into the only place with big returns \u2014 real estate.\n\nFor around four years, China has been building around 1 billion square meters of housing a year, ten times the figure in the U.S. The amount needed to accommodate real owners \u2014 people moving from farms to the cities, for example \u2014 is 700 million square meters.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume that demand goes back to that level. China is also swamped with seven to eight million vacant units. If around two million of those are sold a year, China will need to build just 500 million square meters annually \u2014 half of the total over the past several years. That decline will pound not just expenditures on apartments, but production of steel, copper and appliances.\n\nBy Aliber\u2019s reckoning, the sharp decline in housing production could lower China\u2019s growth rate by a full five points. In his view, around three points of its 9.2% growth rate in 2011 came from the bubble. Shave two more points for the empty apartments that need to be sold, and future growth looks far less robust than the official projections.\n\nUnlike the post-crash U.S., China will keep growing after the bubble bursts, though at a far slower rate. What bears watching is the effect of another gigantic stimulus program to compensate for the decline in housing. If renewed inflation follows, so will a slowdown needed to tame it.\n\nOr as Aliber observes, \u201cChina\u2019s spurt of a 10% growth rate is likely to be history.\u201d",

The days of rubbish amps and teenybopper gaggles were in the past, and the two Fillmore venues \u2014 one on each coast \u2014 were the psychedelic Mecca and Medina of the post-pop crowd.\n\n\u201cSly and the Family Stone: Live at the Fillmore East \u2014 October 4th & 5th, 1968,\u201d a four-disc set, released last week and comprising four shows played across two nights, is sourced from New York \u2014 and, one might add, plenty of people\u2019s wish lists, since there has been so little live Sly available over the years. And with the opening notes of \u201cAre You Ready\u201d \u2014 a query doubling as a warning that you are about to get seriously rocked \u2014 it\u2019s evident that this is going to be one doozy of a box.\n\nThe first show has some technical bugs, \u2014 amps act up, microphones fluctuate \u2014 but that only serves to bolster an inchoate feel from which Stone had a knack for wringing rhythm. The second show that night is pure groove, including a version of \u201cDance to the Music\u201d with a pliancy that even the well-known studio cut lacks. It\u2019s all the more remarkable given that blues, R&B, soul jazz, hambone satire, Louis Armstrong-style vocalese, and Bachian modulations all go into the mix. That it works seamlessly is pure Sly, which is why he mattered as rock and soul\u2019s foremost assimilator.\n\nOne highlight of the early show from the second night is a treatment of \u201cColor Me True\u201d with barbershop polyphonies brought to bear amid the Family\u2019s perpetual roiling. \u201cDo you take credit for somebody else\u2019s cooking?\u201d goes one refrain, inviting the response, nope, this is all you guys. The third show also features the best version of the Otis Redding-like stomper \u201cM\u2019Lady,\u201d and goodness how it churns and burns. Pumping bass, full-throated horns, giant fistfuls of funky organ notes, cannonades of drums: This is just a massive sound, punctuated with unaccompanied vocals that in turn morph into wordless instruments.\n\nThings come completely untethered at the final show, a soul-music symposium voiced by members of a band that had never been tighter as a live act. The \u201cTurn Me Loose / I Can\u2019t Turn You Loose\u201d medley might as well come with an advisory to don a helmet, lest you dance too hard and jar your skull against a wall. Sister Rosie Stone, on keyboards and vocals, is a huge presence throughout, and at one point Stone pleads with the sound man to turn her up. Hers is the voice that cuts best through Stone\u2019s slab of sound.\n\nStone himself is quite the sound painter on the organ. It\u2019s something for which he\u2019s never been given a ton of credit: That organ that manages to be both an obvious hallmark of the band at its greatest fettle and a surprise, too, when it comes washing over you.\n\nThere\u2019s enough variety here that you understand why the whole shebang needed to come out \u2014 and vintage audiophiles will just about bow down before the quality of these tapes. Had a record label released that second show from Oct. 4 as a single LP back in its day, we\u2019d be going on almost five decades now with a live Sly Stone album counting as as one of the best ever waxed.

Residents lived under U.S. rule for the next 27 years.\n\nEven now, Okinawa hosts nearly 75 percent of the U.S. military presence in Japan, taking up 18 percent of its land area.\n\nAbe's push to beef up Japan's military, driven by China's growing assertiveness, has some worried in Okinawa, which sits some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) south of Tokyo. Last month, buoyed by December's re-election, his government passed a record $42 billion defence budget.\n\n\"In the hypothetical case of a military 'situation,' Tokyo is so far away it won't feel the pain, just like 70 years ago,\" Nago mayor Susumu Inamine told Reuters.\n\n\"Then, Okinawa helped buy time for the home islands, and this thinking basically hasn't changed. People on the mainland want Okinawans to put up with everything so they can feel safe.\"\n\nEveryone agrees that Futenma, crammed in the middle of a densely-populated residential area, must be moved.

Reasons include the planned deployment of the controversial Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, loathed for its noise, among other reasons.\n\nRead MoreCranking up reforms: Tokyo analysts to lose overtime pay\n\n\"The vibrations make your insides go numb,\" said Kanako Kawakami, a 56-year-old resident of Ginowan, the site of Futenma.\n\nHuddled among a group of 100 protesters, Kawakami was part of a round-the-clock vigil on a hillside in front of Camp Schwab, a U.S. base that abuts the Henoko site.\n\nDump trucks arrived in the dead of night. In January, an 80-year-old woman was hurt in clashes between protesters and riot police.\n\nThe bases have always been a devil's bargain for Japan's second-poorest prefecture, where unemployment is about 75 percent higher than the national average.\n\nIn the rundown city of Nago, Abe's vaunted economic growth policies appear to have had little impact on its 61,500 residents. Some are resigned. \"Bases bring in money,\" said taxi driver Masatsune Naka, 65. \"People have to support families.\"\n\nTo help the prefecture, Tokyo has provided a generous development budget, insisting it is not linked to bases.\n\nBut after the election of anti-base governor Takeshi Onaga in November, and the trouncing of ruling party candidates in a December parliamentary election, the government said it was cutting the budget by 16 billion yen to 334 billion yen in the 2015/16 fiscal year.\n\nAnd as the percentage of the island's GDP coming from the bases falls - from 15 percent in 1972 to 4.9 percent in 2011 - Okinawans are aware they need to be more self-reliant.\n\nTourism now accounts for nearly 10 percent of GDP, including a hefty number of foreigners.\n\nFreeing up base land for local use would also allow expansion of growing industries such as information technology and call centers.\n\nEconomically, though, things would be tough.

        "text": "Twenty-five years ago Wednesday, Chinese troops violently retook the square in Beijing where pro-democracy protesters had set up camp for weeks. The Tiananmen Square massacre left an unknown number dead, with some estimates in the thousands, and smothered a democratic movement. But after a quarter-century\u2014and a thorough attempt by the Chinese government to conceal the events that unfolded that June\u2014our collective memory is sometimes limited to not much more than an image of a man defiantly standing in front of a tank.\n\nSo TIME went back in history to pull out the details, context and feelings of those grim days from our own unfolding coverage at the time, including a cover story from the June 12, 1989 issue. The articles give color, detail and context that are sometimes lost 25 years later. Here are five key facts that may have been buried in time:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only protest\n\nThe demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, which at one point had reportedly ballooned to a million people, were not the only pro-democracy protests in the country at the time. Demonstrations had spread to hundreds of cities, including Shanghai, China\u2019s largest, and in the days after the military mobilized in Beijing, protesters were putting up blockades in Shanghai.\n\nAnd to be sure, it wasn\u2019t the first time protesters had filled the Square in Beijing, a space for public protest. More than a decade earlier, in what became known as the Tiananmen Incident, a similar if smaller-scale crackdown on protesters spawned outrage and led to a reshuffling of the nation\u2019s top leadership.\n\nIn a report on the \u201cTank Man\u201d several years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, TIME described the Square as:\n\nTiananmen Square\u2013the very heart of the Middle Kingdom, where students had demonstrated in 1919 [as part of the \u201cMay Fourth Movement\u201d]; where Mao had proclaimed a \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic\u201d in 1949 on behalf of the Chinese people who had \u201cstood up\u201d; and where leaders customarily inspect their People\u2019s Liberation Army troops\u2014is a virtual monument to People Power in the abstract.\n\nChinese authorities still censor information about the massacre\n\nMore than a quarter century after the massacre, the Chinese government\u2019s extensive censorship apparatus\u2014which employs two million online censors \u2014 still rigorously blocks information about the protest. The ban is so total that not only is the search term \u201cTiananmen Square\u201d censored, but so too are related words and phrases. Authorities have even gone as far as blocking combinations of the numbers 6, 4, 1989 that might obliquely reference the date of the protest, June 4, 1989. So for many members of the world\u2019s largest online population, the facts about the bloody crackdown have been erased.\n\nGorbachev entered through the back door\n\nThe protests presented an embarrassing pickle for the Chinese government during a visit from the Soviet Union\u2019s Mikhail Gorbachev, the first visit from a leader of China\u2019s communist peer in 30 years. The Chinese had scheduled a state banquet in the Great Hall of the People at the edge of the Square in May, as the protests raged. Gorbachev ended up having to go through the back door.\n\nWhen the military opened fire, a lopsided battle ensued\n\nIn the early hours of June 4, 50 trucks and as many as 10,000 troops rumbled into the streets, TIME reported just days later. The military overwhelmed the civilians and began firing into crowds, but some protesters held fast, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. In some cases, they responded with deadly violence: Demonstrators reportedly beat two soldiers to death who had been seen killing a civilian. In another instance, protesters covered an armored personnel carrier in banners and then set the vehicle ablaze, trapping the crew of eight or nine soldiers. The military continued its onslaught and skirmishes lasted throughout the morning, \u201cbut by then the great, peaceful dream for democracy had become a horrible nightmare.\u201d A doctor at the time said at least 500 were dead; a radio announcer said 1,000.\n\nA goddess lived and died\n\nA few days before the raid on the square, \u201cin a flash of exuberance\u201d as TIME wrote at the time, the protesters erected a \u201cGoddess of Democracy\u201d that partially resembled the Statue of Liberty. The 30-foot statue swiftly made from Styrofoam and plaster became a symbolic monument to the pro-democracy movement, and was intended to be large enough to be difficult or at least embarrassing for authorities to take down. Tanks crushed her when troops took the square, TIME reported.\n\nThe Tank Man was and still is anonymous\n\n\u201cAlmost certainly he was seen in his moment of self-transcendence by more people than ever laid eyes on Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and James Joyce combined,\u201d essayist Pico Iyer wrote in TIME about Tank Man, the nameless individual who was pictured stopping a column of tanks on June 5, a day after the massacre. The man was ultimately hustled to safety by fellow protesters and quite lost to the crowd. Only rumors of his identity persist, and when Chinese leader Jiang Zermin was asked a year later if he know what had happened to the young man, he responded: \u201cI think never killed.\u201d\n\nCheck out Iyer\u2019s full piece on the \u201cUnknown Rebel\u201d here.\n\nTIME\u2018s issue from June 12, 1989 features a cover from the massacre.

The move, which goes into effect on June 20, will be a big blow to Amex as it loses business from the millions of customers who patronize the second largest U.S. retailer.\n\nThe new credit card, which will be issued by Citi c for Costco, will be called \u201cCostco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi\u201d and double as a membership card for Costco shoppers. (American Express Costco cards will automatically be canceled and won\u2019t work at any stores after June 19. Citi will automatically send the card out to Amex Costco cardholders in May.)\n\nIt is clear that it is a much more generous program than the Amex card it will soon replace, something Nomura Securities analyst Robert Drbul said would bring in more customers and help Costco stand out from other retailers.\n\nThe Citi card will offer Costco members 4% cash back on up to $7,000 spent on gas, compared to 3% back up to $4,000 with Amex. Cardholders will also get 3% back on restaurants and travel, a point higher than with the Amex cards. There is no annual fee but shoppers will need to pay for a $55 annual Costco membership.\n\n\u201cWe believe the improved rewards program has strong potential to drive this card to top-of-wallet for many consumers, which should also benefit Costco,\u201d Drbul said in his note.\n\nAs Costco looks to fend off Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s wmt efforts to win new business, the new Visa card may offer the discount retailer a helping hand. As Sean McQuay, credit card expert for Nerdwallet, told the Chicago Tribune this week, the Visa card could entice people who aren\u2019t currently Costco shoppers.\n\nAccording to McQuay, the Costco Visa offers the best cash back rates on gas, restaurants, and travel. And Costco customers tend to be affluent, a highly desirable clientele for credit card companies. The median household income of a Costco member is about $120,000, according to some estimates.",

        "text": "PANAMA CITY, Panama\u2014On a recent Tuesday morning, Captain Fernando Jaen was piloting a cargo ship through the Panama Canal\u2019s new set of intimidatingly narrow locks.\n\n\u201cThe times we\u2019ve had conversations, we ended up crashing,\u201d Capt. Jaen said. \u201cYou have to concentrate.\u201d\n\nMoments later, a tiny miscalculation sent the ship\u2019s midsection on a course to brush the wall. If the impact were severe, Capt. Jaen knew that he, and possibly the entire crew, might be plunged into the watery abyss below\u2014which, in this case, might have required everybody to take a break and change their socks.\n\nThe Panama Canal evokes romantic images of seafaring precision and derring-do. Here, at a new $8 million training facility for freighter pilots, the only outsize thing is the potential for embarrassment. Experienced Canal pilots climb aboard miniature battery-powered ships with little engines, little rudders and little anchors all meticulously constructed to match the dimensions of real cargo vessels in 1-to-25 scale. They traverse a scale replica of the canal where the water ranges from about 2 feet to six-and-half feet deep.\n\nThere is nothing Titanic here. About the length of two pickup trucks, the ships have room for two to four sailors to safely stand or sit on their decks, which are sometimes piled with faux cargo containers that double as chairs.\n\nWhen it gets cramped, pilots switch around to stretch their legs. The \u201ctugmasters\u201d who join them steer suitcase-sized tugboats by joystick on a remote control.\n\nIt is all part of what Panama Canal Authority officials refer to as a laboratory for maneuvers\u2014a roughly 10-acre scale remake of the real Canal, complete with elfin docks, locks and a clone of the Culebra Cut that connects two man-made lakes in which several stations along the Canal are re-created.\n\n\u201cFor everyone that comes in, they kind of laugh at the beginning. They look like toys,\u201d said Capt. Jose Burgos, a Panama Canal pilot and training officer. \u201cThat\u2019s the rub.\u201d\n\nIn a recent practice run, Capt. Londor A. Rankin, the Panama Canal Pilots Union\u2019s Secretary-General, and a pilot with more than 30 years of experience, hit a bank. A rubber stopper resembling a clown\u2019s nose on the boat\u2019s submerged bow softened the blow. Capt. Rankin straightened his vessel for another round of bumper ships.\n\nThe effect on his pride was life-size. \u201cIt made my ego feel this small,\u201d he said, gesturing with his hands. \u201cYou have to respect the vessels in the simulator, as well as we respect the vessels in real life because they react very similar.\u201d\n\nThe facility, which opened in March, is the newest of a handful of tiny training centers, including ones in France, Australia and the U.S., where maritime professionals come to practice driving gargantuan vessels without actually driving gargantuan vessels, which is impractical.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re piloting ships, we\u2019re doing it for our customers. You don\u2019t practice things on your customers,\u201d said Capt. Alison Buckler, talking about a training course she took at the Maritime Pilots Institute in Louisiana.\n\nShe had her picture taken from the stern of a miniature cargo ship. She later posted it to Facebook. Her mother wrote \u201cCute!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a little boat,\u201d said Capt. Buckler, who\u2019s been a pilot for 12 years. \u201cPeople don\u2019t get it, but in our world, people get it.\u201d\n\nThe new Panama center runs parallel to the real Culebra Cut in Summit, a region of Panama City, among lush hills brimming with monkeys and the occasional crocodile, one of which recently wandered into the training lakes. It was promptly evicted and a fence went up.\n\nAs the Panama Canal nears the end of a nine-year, $5 billion expansion to accommodate bigger ships, scheduled to open June 26, the Canal Authority plans to train its roughly 250 pilots on the new waterways.\n\nThey are also using computer simulators, but animations can\u2019t fully replicate the feel of wind and water currents. Working on physical models provides a just-right dose of reality without life-size risks, said Nick Cutmore, secretary-general for the International Maritime Pilots Association, which promotes manned-model training.\n\nAt Summit and similar facilities, sea pilots get a dress rehearsal for disaster on a diminutive scale: malfunctioning electrical systems, stuck anchors, broken rudders.\n\nMiniatures can be used to replicate all kinds of complicated real-life situations. With CyberCity, a 48-square-foot, 1-to-87 scale fake town, cybersecurity experts train to protect unsuspecting citizens from hackers. Two tabletop CyberCity settlements in New Jersey and Colorado, built by the SANS Institute, react to cybercriminals as they would in the real world. If hackers derail a train, the city\u2019s tiny model train actually derails. If they fire the rocket, a Nerf projectile goes off.\n\nBecause they are scale replicas, the pee-wee ships feel like real ones, said Capt. Jaen. How they turn and respond to different water depths, plus their line of sight and horsepower, create the illusion of being on a colossal counterpart.\n\nThat said, the lakes\u2019 birds and fish look like giants against the scale models. Rough winds rock a model ship much more violently. And everything happens faster on the smaller scale, making the exercise mentally taxing, trainers and trainees said.\n\nOne criticism of these mini-ships, said Capt. Joseph Murphy, a marine transportation professor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, is cost. Weeklong training sessions can run upward of $10,000. The models themselves cost hundreds of thousands, and they simulate only the ship in whose likeness they are built.\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority shelled out roughly $500,000 for each of its two model freight carriers and is buying a third.\n\nIn a computer simulator, the \u201cship\u201d can morph from a tanker to a cruise to a cargo carrier, said Mark Woolley, chief of staff in the Office of the President at SUNY Maritime College in New York City and a former executive for a simulator-development company.\n\n\u201cSimulation technology is so advanced, I don\u2019t really see the need to go out on a small pond in a boat,\u201d said retired U.S. Navy Captain Woolley. He said he has never boarded one.\n\nThe Canal Authority is banking others will see the need. It hopes its manned-model unit will draw mariners from around the world.\n\n\u201cYou feel the adrenaline,\u201d said Capt. Rankin, the pilots-union representative. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the best training we have gotten here.\u201d",

        "text": "The Entrepreneur Insiders network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America\u2019s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cHow do you build a strong team?\u201d is written by Brian Smith, chief wine officer at Winc.\n\nThe quality I always look for in individuals is the same quality that I would hope to get out of a high-performance team: intuition. Those who have intuition are more equipped to see opportunities, find an optimal solution, and innovate, all while understanding their partner\u2019s positions or motives. It is an awareness that makes people more creative, effective, and generally more fun to work with.\n\nIn order to pinpoint intuition, I look for people who may have started something on their own, even if it has failed. It\u2019s more about taking initiative, seeing the landscape, and trying to find a niche solution or opportunity. I always like to ask, \u201cWhen was the last time that you created something you were proud of?\u201d It\u2019s a classic interview question for me, regardless of the role.\n\nOnce you have some incredible people on your team, the next steps are to get aligned and stay connected. Alignment and connectivity are the pillars for success on any team. Not only do people need to embrace and understand the big goals, but they need to embrace consistent communication and maintain focus to increase the probability of hitting those goals.\n\nSee also: Why Hiring Just for Experience Is a Really Bad Idea\n\nFor most of us, it\u2019s nearly impossible to step away from the day-to-day action, but I have become a huge believer in getting offsite. It\u2019s amazing what a change of scenery and a bare-bones agenda can get you. These are often the greatest opportunities for strategic alignment, deeper understanding, and innovation as a team. At a recent offsite, we encouraged the team to challenge the status quo. One of our team members came up with the idea to change the way we packaged our wine, and we ended up saving a few hundred thousand dollars in addition to significantly reducing our environmental impact. You can\u2019t get to these types of ideas if you don\u2019t provide your team with a free and open environment to put everything on the table.\n\nOnce you have the big goals and initiatives, it all comes down to execution. This is hard, especially in the winemaking business. For about a third of the year, I\u2019m in remote vineyards all over the world, and the days are long. Travel like this completely takes me away from day-to-day communication with my team. But spending time in the market or in the vineyards with purveyors, customers, growers, and winemakers is invaluable to informing my point of view.\n\nTo stay connected while I\u2019m traveling, I try to schedule a 30-minute touch-base meeting with each leader every week. We leverage 15Five, which is a great tool for recapping the week\u2019s wins, losses, near-term goals, and challenges.\n\nHire intuitive people, build a strategy together, and have a clear system for achieving success. To me, this is the foundation for a successful team. If you can throw in a little passion and fun, the sky is the limit.",

The money, which is almost five times the amount raised by any other venture firm in the world in 2015, comes mostly from tax revenues or state backed loans, and is funneled into some 780 funds across the country.\n\nThe government is riding on the hope that entrepreneurship will help boost the market, but not everyone agrees the plan will work.\n\n\u201cThey have a fantasy that if they give everyone money they\u2019ll create entrepreneurs,\u201d Gary Rieschel, the founder of Qiming Venture Partners told Bloomberg. \u201cWhat it will result in is catastrophic losses for the government.\u201d\n\nRieschel\u2019s comments could have some merit: the funds are experimental and China has no standardized method for its 780 funds to be managed or funded.\n\nOne thing is sure though: investment managers who don\u2019t spend enough funding could potentially see a smaller amount to manage the next year.

The unveiling has been widely anticipated following last year\u2019s acquisition of calling and screen-sharing app Screenhero by Slack.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\n\nThe feature, according to TechCrunch, is for the time being a beta available to less than 50% of Slack users, and allows audio conferencing and emoji during calls.

        "text": "Few observers were surprised when tech giant Hewlett-Packard (\n\n) for hiring Mark Hurd -- HP's former CEO -- as co-president. After all, Hurd is no doubt in possession of HP's crown-jewel corporate secrets. Moreover, HP, which competes directly with Oracle in a number of critical enterprise software and hardware markets, probably had no choice, if for no other reason than to save face.\n\nBut Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is a man who inevitably gets exactly what he wants -- and in this case, what he wants may be HP itself, in order to better to compete with IBM (\n\n). But buying HP, a $90 billion Goliath? That's crazy, right?\n\n\"Larry Ellison is borderline bat-shit crazy on a good day,\" says veteran Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. \"I think his bet is that he can damage HP enough that it drops in value and he can wander in with an offer.\"\n\n\"Ellison believes he can do anything, and he wants to go after IBM,\" Enderle adds. \"If he can figure out a way to get HP, then I believe he would like to do that. Because he would really like to bring IBM out, and he needs [a company] of the stature of HP to do it.\"\n\nOracle's market capitalization is about $120 billion so, at least in theory, some kind of stock-based transaction is possible.\n\nAnd what better person to integrate HP into Oracle than its highly successful -- Hurd was loved on Wall Street, though loathed inside HP -- former CEO? At least Ellison has traded up from Charles Phillips, a once-powerful but now crippled co-president at Oracle who had spent much of his recent year in a very public and very ugly spat over adultery allegations that included a honest-to-goodness billboard campaign against the former investment banker.\n\nIndeed, Hurd has shown he can do top-notch cost-cutting of the sort that Larry likes and needs in order to integrate his myriad acquisitions. Further, Hurd and Ellison share a \"buy-it, don't-build\" mindset that should make for an easy working relationship.\n\n\"Oracle wants to rebuild Sun, and Hurd is a turnaround packager who never really sold the package at HP,\" says Enderle. \"He's left a mess, stripped to the bone, but with good financials.\"\n\nEllison is a man with ambitions as big as his MIG-29 fighter jet is fast, and he's got a history of stating that the info-tech industry will further consolidate in the same way the auto industry consolidated into the Big Three in the U.S.\n\nWith his purchase of Sun Microsystems, Ellison showed an appetite for enterprise hardware that he could use to vertically integrate sales of what is now a near-complete enterprise software stack, which includes databases, application server/middleware, customer-relationship management tools, financial applications, product-lifecycle management and enterprise resource planning tools.\n\nHP's strong position in the hardware and server market would instantly give Oracle a reason to touch millions of customers at myriad places in their business, from storage, to networking, to servers. That's a position IBM has also valued, considering its continued investments in its hardware lines like server and storage (even as it cast off its less profitable PC lines to Lenovo).\n\nTrue, lots of orphans would be left over in an Oracle-HP deal. HP's core printer and imaging unit doesn't clearly fit into Oracle's fold, nor does its big consumer and PC products or its foray into smartphones via the recent acquisition of Palm.\n\nEnderle theorizes that Ellison would spin out HP's printing and imaging business. \"But this all hinges on whether Hurd can execute,\" Enderle says. \"If I'm right, Larry wants to walk away with a [combined] company that would go head-to-head with IBM virtually anywhere. The deal would be very difficult and somewhat convoluted, but we're talking about a guy [Ellison] who lives and breathes war.\"\n\nWhen your end goal is global dominance, difficulty is a mere distraction. And this would likely be a three-year to five-year plan. HP's lawsuit will likely tie up Hurd and Oracle for quite some time, but Ellison is a powerful force, and his wishes rarely go unrealized.\n\nHP claims Hurd can't perform his new job of co-president without disclosing HP secrets in violation of his confidentiality agreement. But Enderle points out that in California, noncompete and other employment contract clauses are \"generally unenforceable.\"\n\n\"HP can go after Hurd's [$40 million] severance package,\" says Enderle, \"but they can't keep him out of Oracle.\" And what could be sweeter revenge for Hurd than winding up running HP again -- as a part of Oracle?",

Highly liquid guests are assigned casino hosts who make certain things disappear (lines, doormen) and other things appear (tables, perhaps some company). But if you\u2019re not among the super-rich and already enjoying such privileges, it pays to be crafty.\n\nJust ask Jack Colton, a local Vegas hero who reveals the secrets of Sin City nightlife on his Web site to everyday players who aspire to VIP-table status. One of his tips: If you\u2019re waiting in line in a large group of men, try scattering yourself among several groups of ladies. Divide and conquer.\n\nIn Depth: Vegas\u2019 Top Nightclubs\n\nAnd once you\u2019re inside, it\u2019s a good idea to just go with the flow. That is, assuming you can accept that this is all about excessive consumption and pushing the limits of a credit card, not to mention what\u2019s socially acceptable behavior just about anywhere else in the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about building a buzz for the nightclubs as well as a client\u00e8le, not just celebrities but also brands. In Vegas a club is only as good as their last event,\u201d says Andrea Sun, one of the nightlife experts at Vegas.com.\n\nEuropean-style tableside bottle service is becoming more and more de rigeur\u2013in return for a nice table, guests are obliged to purchase bottles of alcohol at astronomical mark-ups. And nightclubs and their marketing departments are heavily invested in customized experiences, especially when it concerns celebrities.\n\nDeborah Krause, COO of PURE Management Group, which runs the club by the same name in Caesar\u2019s Palace, says, \u201cPMG has established a reputation for excellence by providing service with flair. We strive to offer celebrities and VIPs with a nightlife experience that is seamless and unparalleled, and that personalized VIP service also translates to all of our patrons, making every guest who visits a PMG venue feel like a VIP.\u201d\n\nSo which club should you choose? If you\u2019re looking for a high-energy mega-club, we suggest Studio 54 or Rain. If you\u2019re looking to impress some clients with a Vegas experience they\u2019re likely to go home and brag about, don\u2019t miss TAO, Moon or PURE. And for more of a mellow, airy evening, we suggest Tryst at Wynn Las Vegas, with its 90-foot waterfall.\n\nAs with other leisure pursuits, timing is crucial. On Fridays and Saturdays Vegas nightclubs are filled with tourists, while on select weeknights the clubs host industry nights for the locals. Moon hosts a Tuesday industry night that\u0092s popular with other club employees.\n\n\u201cClubs thrive on weekends and industry nights,\u201d says Sun. \u201cBoth options are strong and well-known.\u201d\n\nWherever and whenever you go, though, Colton warns that while dozens of \u201cVIP hosting companies\u201d promise access to exclusive clubs, you\u2019re usually better off tipping the doorman directly. And by tipping, we don\u2019t mean five bucks. A few other words of advice:\n\n\u2013Ask about the bottle minimum before you show up. \u2013If you\u2019re splitting the bill between friends, collect the money up-front (to make sure you\u2019re still friends at the end of the night). \u2013Don\u2019t get hustled\u2013make sure you\u2019re not obligated to buy more bottles to avoid losing your table. \u2013Have fun.\n\nIn Depth: Vegas\u2019 Top Nightclubs\n\nLike this story?

We boomers grew accustomed to the notion, forged over decades, that we drove the zeitgeist of our times. No more. Millennials rule.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true in the workplace (see our coverage of the 100 Best Companies to Work For). Any discussion of talent quickly devolves into a dissection of the millennial mind. Managers struggle with preconceptions. Must millennials change jobs every two years? Do they require constant reinforcement, after a childhood of \u201ceverybody\u2019s a winner\u201d? Do they need a \u201cchill\u201d workplace? Free food? Foosball?\n\nMany of the popular notions are pure myth. Some busted ones:\n\nMillennials want to change jobs frequently.\n\nWrong. A study by my former colleagues at the Pew Research Center shows that millennials actually value job security more highly than boomers do. But they won\u2019t stay at a job they don\u2019t like. Some 50% of millennials say having a \u201cjob you enjoy\u201d is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them, compared with just 38% of boomers.\n\nMaybe. The Pew study found that millennials put \u201ca high-paying job\u201d near the bottom of their list of work priorities\u2014but so do other generations, in roughly equal numbers. Count me a skeptic on all counts. What people say when surveyed over the phone and how they act when an offer is on the table are different things.\n\nEvery Millennial wants to be an entrepreneur.\n\nThey may all want to be Mark Zuckerberg, but it\u2019s not happening. A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Reserve data shows the share of people under age 30 who own private businesses has hit a 24-year low\u2014just 3.6%, down from 10.6% in 1989.\n\nStill, there is no doubt that this generation is different. It is the most diverse in American history\u201443% nonwhite\u2014and more confident about the nation\u2019s future than older generations. That\u2019s a reverse from the 1970s, when young boomers were considerably less optimistic than their elders. Millennials also are slower to get married than earlier generations and less likely to belong to a political party\u2014which may make their employer, by default, the most important institutional affiliation in their lives.\n\nThe biggest difference is not who they are, but how they live. They are the ones most comfortable with the new human appendage\u2014the smartphone\u2014that lets them stay connected to a vast network of friends and provides instant access to information, both good and bad. They are quickest to adapt to the ways in which the mobile Internet is changing the fundamental logistics of their lives, and the first to demand the workplace do the same.\n\nSo pay attention. The millennials aren\u2019t spoiled products of a coddled past. They are harbingers of our connected future.\n\nWe had some fun developing cover look for this issue. The full-size versions are in the magazine. Let us know what you think.\n\nThis story is from the March 15, 2015 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "Every new startup wants to be the \u201cUber of . . .\u201d its own industry, but now an entrepreneur is claiming the popular ride-sharing app was actually stolen.\n\nKevin Halpern filed a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court on Thursday claiming that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stole the idea for a \u201creal-time, cellular phone-based\u201d car service from a startup, Celluride Wireless, that Halpern founded in 2003. Celluride appears to no longer be in operation, though the company is named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with Halpern.\n\nThe lawsuit filed against Uber in claims that Halpern began meeting with Kalanick \u2014 whom the complaint describes as \u201can approachable fellow entrepreneur\u201d \u2014 in 2006 and later shared detailed information about the ongoing development of Celluride with the future Uber co-founder. Halpern alleges that these discussions were held under the guise of confidentiality. Halpern worked until 2008 to develop the technology for Celluride, which, the lawsuit says, is similar to Uber\u2019s business and app interface. Halpern claims Kalanick and fellow Uber co-founder Garrett Camp then stole his trade secrets and presented them as their own at a venture capital conference in the fall of 2008, which was months before the launch of Uber.\n\nUber said Thursday that Halpern\u2019s lawsuit has no merit. \u201cThese claims are completely baseless. We will vigorously defend against them,\u201d Uber spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said in a statement.\n\nHalpern is accusing Kalanick and Camp, along with a handful of venture capital firms that back Uber, of misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion (illegally using someone else\u2019s idea) and breach of contract. The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages. An attorney for Halpern did not immediately respond to Fortune when asked why the lawsuit was not filed until this week, more than six years after Uber\u2019s founding. (Halpern\u2019s attorney announced the lawsuit in a taped press conference.)\n\nIn 2009, Halpern sued Anu Shukla, the founder of tech company Offerpal Media (now called Tapjoy), for breach of contract in a similar lawsuit that alleged Halpern helped create Offerpal only to be cut out of the company shortly before it was founded. That lawsuit was later dismissed, as was another one filed against two Santa Cruz police officers who arrested him for being under the influence of an illegal stimulant.\n\nOf course, Uber is no stranger to legal action itself. The ride-sharing service has faced lawsuits from taxi companies as well as charges brought by passengers and former Uber drivers.\n\nSuccessful tech companies are often the targets of lawsuits by people claiming to behind the original idea. Facebook, for example, was sued by the Winklevoss brothers, who attended Harvard with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The brothers, who claimed Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social network, eventually won a settlement. In another lawsuit against Facebook, Paul Ceglia claimed to have a contract showing that Zuckerberg had promised him half of the company. Ceglia has since reportedly gone missing after being accused in federal court of fabricating the evidence.\n\nFor more about Uber, watch this Fortune video:",

It\u2019s part of a new class of powerful but expensive medicines that block a protein called PCSK9 from degrading receptors that remove bad LDL cholesterol from the blood.\n\nThe first similar drug, approved by regulators last month, hit the market at a price of $14,600 per year. Insurers had hoped more competition would lower the cost of such treatments. But any immediate relief will be modest. Amgen said it plans to charge $14,100 per year for Repatha.\n\nMore than 73 million Americans have high levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 15 percent, those who don\u2019t respond to or are only partly helped by inexpensive and widely prescribed statins, are candidates for Repatha. But that is a huge market for Amgen, the largest US biotech by market value.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Repatha as a second-line therapy for patients with heart conditions who already take statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cRepatha provides another treatment option in this new class of drugs for patients with [hereditary high cholesterol] or with known cardiovascular disease who have not been able to lower their LDL cholesterol enough with statins,\u201d Dr. John Jenkins, head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said.\n\nWhile considered highly effective, the new PCSK9 inhibitors were immediately scrutinized by health insurers for their hefty price tags.\n\n\u201cThe focus will be on how you deliver the best value and the best price for patients,\u201d said Clare Krusing, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group. \u201cBut when these new medications across the board are bringing five- and six-figure price tags, that\u2019s becoming the new norm. So we have to negotiate from a higher starting point.\u201d\n\nExecutive vice president Anthony C. Hooper said Amgen \u201cis sensitive to the concerns of payers around cost, budget predictability, and paying for value.\u201d\n\nRepatha and the rival PCSK9 injectable called Praluent, made by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., may eventually face increased competition. But health insurers are expected to try to restrict the market for PCSK9 drugs to the highest-risk cardiovascular patients, said Peter Chang, principal scientific analyst at Informa PLC in San Diego.\n\n\u201cThese drugs are a breakthrough,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey dramatically lower LDL cholesterol levels and have the potential to reduce cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes even further for people who also take statins.\u201d\n\nMost cholesterol drug patients pay less than $250 a year because the statin market is dominated by low-cost generics, said Steve Miller, chief medical officer for Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefits manager, which negotiates pricing with drug companies on behalf of insurers and employers.\n\n\u201cThese drugs represent an enormous step up to more than $10,000 a year,\u201d said Miller, who added that drug makers hope to win approval for PCSK9 drugs as \u201cfirst-line\u201d treatments for primary prevention. \u201cThis will probably over time become the biggest class of drugs in history.\u201d\n\nEven as second-line therapies, the new drugs could represent a big share of the market for all cholesterol drugs \u2014 projected to be as much as $24 billion in 2018 by the research firm IMS Health.\n\n\u201cWe believe the PCSK9 class could be $5 billion to $10 billion worldwide long term, and Amgen could get around half the share,\u201d said Michael J. Yee, at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAmgen\u2019s drug will be produced at its plant in Rhode Island, where Amgen also makes Enbrel, a top-selling drug for rheumatoid arthritis, and Vectibix, for colorectal cancer.\n\nThe new drugs have been shown to lower bad cholesterol 54 to 77 percent. High levels of bad cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease.",

        "text": "To many people Kodak means memories, and with the news the 130-year old photographic company filed for bankruptcy we were flooded with images sent it by readers keen to collaborate on a gallery of their favourite \"Kodak moments\".\n\nFlicking through the photos, not only do the grainy Kodak pictures show something of times past and a collective nostalgia for things lost \u2013 but some of the photos clearly have more of a story to tell.\n\nPaul Baldwin (photo 38) sends in this image of his great grandmother \u2013 one of the iconic \"Kodak girls\" who worked at Eastman Kodak in the US. His grandparents moved to the US, got married and settled there \u2013 and after the first world war returned to the UK.\n\nMany have also been interested in Chris Miller's tale of how he ended up with this close up shot of the late Lady Di at Tidworth in Wiltshire, looking straight down the barrel of the lens in what he calls one of the first times she became visibly upset by the press onslaught.\n\nNot only did readers tell us about their particular memories related to people in the pictures \u2013 but also about their fondness for the Kodak technology and techniques used to capture, and record the image.\n\nOn our Kodak thread on Flickr, where readers are continuing to share their images, there is much discussion on the methods used and the result \u2013 and our pictures editor Roger Tooth aptly describes the fondness for the Kodak products in this comment piece:\n\n\"That was the thing about shooting on film and printing on paper: every time, it felt fresh. Fresh film, chilled from a fridge. Box fresh, beautifully packaged by Kodak in cute yellow boxes that opened with one thumb, perforated in exactly the right place.\"\n\nOne Kodak product which has been fondly recalled by the youth of the 90s is the disposable hand-held camera. Found at wedding parties, taken on many a travel trip or bought off the cuff to document the events of a sunny day \u2013 the disposable camera was the common companion for those on fun and spontaneous escapades.\n\nAlex Kovalenko tells us about a project he's involved with using Kodak disposable cameras called Disposable stories. The camera is given to someone with the direction to take five photos and pass it on. This chain carries on five times until it's returned to Alex and his team \u2013 who process the photos and add them to the project website here.\n\nThe photos from cameras which went round the world in September and June 2011 have just been uploaded and you cannot help but be sapped into the camera's own story \u2013 tracking a journey around the earth in the hands of excited travellers with their own vision of the world and stories to tell from the trip. Alex says:\n\n\"I hope people will continue travelling with those and not only with cameraphones. Such an amazing feeling when you get your photos back from the shop after your trip and don't even really remember which photos you took.\"\n\nGoing back even further in the Kodak production line, Neil Brown on Flickr has shared with us his project of uploading Kodak 35mm slides to the web to make a digital copy. Neil started collecting the slides he found at boot fairs, jumble sales, secondhand shops and auctions, as part of an art project. He writes:\n\n\"This is such a shame, I just love the physical element you get with 35mm slides, which is lost with digital.\"\n\nTake a look at the wall of slides on Neil's website here \u2013 each has a story and memory which feel somewhat lost and forgotten.\n\nBut reader Mark Davies, from Cheltenham, runs a project reuniting lost photographs with the families to whom they originally belonged. Lifebooth, he says, started with a Kodak folder he found at a flea market in Oxford \u2013 this sparked an interest in lost family albums and he soon found many people were selling them on eBay.\n\n\"I thought it was really sad those family artefacts of our memory were ending up being sold and I was interested in the stories behind the albums.\"\n\nMark thinks the lady connected to the images has since passed away, but continues to laboriously look for clues which appear to track one holiday for a boy called Jimmy who in 1949 is photographed next to his father's grave. He's currently looking for a woman called Nancy pictured in this photo:\n\nYou can read more about it on his blog here. He writes:\n\n\"I made a promise to myself that day when I was semi-resigned to being unable to find them, that if I ever saw photo albums for sale, and if there was any kind of information in them that would help me connect them to a family (even just a surname or a place), then I would try to reunite the photographs with someone who had a personal connection with the people in the photos.\"\n\nThis all eventually led to Mark doing a PhD in family photography and he continues to reunite lost family albums with their owners or relatives here.\n\nBut it all started with the Kodak folder \u2013 his \"Kodak moment\".\n\nThere are other similar projects around trying to unearth the stories behind the photographs. And these remind me of one I was familiar with in Cardiff after a pile of photographs was found during a refurbishment of an old music hall \u2013 sparking memories of 1980s Cardiff life and calling for residents to come forward with stories and information on the pictures. The project was called Cardiff Before Cardiff and is run by Jon Pountney.\n\nDo you know of any photographic projects unearthing the stories behind the picture? Let us know in comments. You can see the \"Kodak moments\" gallery here and find out more about getting involved here.",

        "text": "The Northern Avenue Bridge could soon fall down, and US Representative Stephen Lynch is ready to release $9.4 million in federal funding to help design a new one.\n\nThe city will need to match a portion of the money, but Lynch has been waiting more than a decade for Boston to do something about the century-old span. Last week, officials said they plan to start removing the dilapidated bridge in March after the Coast Guard raised concerns that it might tumble into the Fort Point Channel.\n\nThe Walsh administration will begin a formal public process this spring to decide whether to rehab the bridge or build a new one. The city has to do something after committing up to $100 million to replace the link as part of its agreement to woo General Electric Co.\u2019s world headquarters to Boston.\n\nLynch is a former ironworker who built bridges and has been keeping tabs on the Northern Avenue structure because it\u2019s in his district. He isn\u2019t shy about what the city should do. He thinks it\u2019s time to retire a relic. This is not the moment to rebuild a steel swing bridge, a move preferred by some preservationists.\n\n\u201cNo, not at this point,\u201d the South Boston Democrat said. \u201cWe should look at maximum utility.\u201d\n\nTucked in the agreement to bring GE to Boston is a commitment from the city to spend as much as $100 million to reopen the Old Northern Avenue Bridge.\n\nLynch said that means the city should build a new fixed bridge \u2014 one that does not have to open when boats pass underneath like the old span did. He also thinks that\u2019s what the Coast Guard would prefer. Swing bridges are old technology, and not too many folks are building them these days.\n\nLynch says he has secured funds for the bridge work.\n\nLynch also wants the bridge to once again carry cars so the fast-growing Seaport District has another outlet for traffic. He said he recently had lunch with federal judges at the Moakley courthouse who raised concerns about gridlock during high-profile trials and its effect on security and public safety.\n\nThe congressman himself recently experienced the congestion when he it took him 40 minutes to get from his district office at the other end of the Southie waterfront to City Hall.\n\n\u201cI could have walked it,\u201d he said.\n\nLynch wouldn\u2019t be the first congressman from South Boston for whom the Northern Avenue Bridge holds no sentimental value. The late Joe Moakley \u2014 whose seat Lynch filled after his death in 2001 \u2014 famously was not a fan. At one of Southie\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day breakfasts, Moakley brought along a box that contained proposals for the span \u2014 and then proceeded to pull out some dynamite, according to an Associated Press account.\n\nThe oft-told story goes that Moakley did not like the bridge because it blocked views of the Evelyn Moakley Bridge \u2014 named in honor of his wife. That span, built in 1996, connects the Financial District with the Seaport District and was meant to replace its Northern Avenue counterpart.\n\nThe Northern Avenue Bridge hasn\u2019t been structurally sound to carry cars since 1997, and then pedestrians lost access in December 2014 when city engineers had to abruptly shut down the structure because it could not bear any weight.\n\nMike Capuano is one local congressman who does not have an opinion on whether the bridge should be rehabbed. Capuano sits on the transportation committee and told me he\u2019ll go to bat for the city whatever it decides.\n\n\u201cThe $9 million, it\u2019s a wonderful earmark,\u201d he said, but \u201cit\u2019s not going to build a bridge.\u201d\n\nThe Somerville Democrat would like to see cars on the bridge, though he points out that it is unlikely to significantly reduce traffic given the configuration of roads in the area. Capuano would like to see the span remain pedestrian-friendly.\n\nThe city is still figuring out how it will pay for the project. It has tapped a tiny portion of the federal funding Lynch has secured and plans to use the rest. As soon as next month, the city will put out a request to the public to gather ideas on how to rebuild the bridge, followed by a public design process.\n\nChris Osgood, who oversees the city\u2019s departments of transportation and public works, said officials are looking for ideas that will improve access, have a sense of history, and create a space that connects the harbor, the channel, and the Greenway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how to balance those goals,\u201d Osgood said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a lot of steps to make sure preservation is a priority.\u201d\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure. Much to the ire of preservationists, the bridge needs to come down soon because it\u2019s in such poor condition.\n\nEven iron and steel doesn\u2019t stand forever.",

Second is \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show.\u201d I watched almost every day (I was a sickly little kid in a blue-collar family growing up in gritty Revere). Merv introduced me to my first out lesbian, Rita Mae Brown; taught me manners for fancy restaurants; and got celebrities to talk about how awful their childhoods were, which gave me hope for a happy adulthood.\n\nFavorite show right now, and why?\n\n\u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d It\u2019s really not about the zombies.

The challenge comes when a filmmaker tries to fit a life that is as variegated as a jazz solo into that template.\n\nWhen Baker died in 1988 at a well-worn 58, he left behind a messy mythic legacy, enough for many movies (Bruce Weber\u2019s 1988 doc \u201cLet\u2019s Get Lost\u201d is a good start). Budreau focuses on key events in the 1960s (with flashbacks in sleek black and white that would make great album covers) and pretty much makes up the rest.\n\nAt first the results seem both convoluted and one-note, an improvisation that goes nowhere. But when Hawke\u2019s Baker finally slips out of the whiney loser persona and performs \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d the scene evokes Baker\u2019s elusive melancholy and wistful torment, making the earlier fumblings worth the struggle.\n\n\u201cIt came too easy to him,\u201d laments Baker\u2019s long-suffering manager Dick Bock (Callum Keith Rennie). By 1966 the easy times are long gone, and Baker lies strung out on heroin in an Italian jail cell staring at his trumpet on the slimy floor. A tarantula crawls out of it. Then, who should walk in but Dino De Laurentiis, offering to make a biopic of Baker\u2019s life?\n\nThis never happened, and at this point \u201cBlue\u201d threatens to become a meta-movie as the made-up movie within-the-movie merges with the real movie\u2019s real-life flashbacks. Luckily, a drug dealer fed up with Baker\u2019s debt knocks his teeth out. His career seemingly at its end, Baker falls in love with Jane (a great Carmen Ejogo), the actress who plays his real wife in the movie-within-the-movie, and the story slips into a jazz take on the comeback theme.\n\nFor the next two decades, the end notes reveal, Baker made the best music of his career. The film does its job if it encourages people to give that music a listen.\n\nWritten and directed by Robert Budreau. Starring Ethan Hawke, Carmen Ejogo, Callum Keith Rennie. At Kendall Square. 98 minutes. Unrated (drug use, narcissism, bad sex).",

After a few hours of anticipation, the store came back to life, featuring a new version of the iPod Touch.\n\nThe new product is the first substantial change to the iPod line in three years. Gone are the days when an iPod release was enough to headline an Apple AAPL keynote speech; these days a website refresh and press release seem to be sufficient.\n\nThe new iPod Touch features the same processor found in the iPhone 6, an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera, and an improved front-facing camera built for \u201ceven better selfies\u201d (Apple\u2019s words, not mine). The device\u2019s screen size remains unchanged, measuring 4-inches. The device\u2019s faster processor is accompanied by Apple\u2019s M8 coprocessor, a chip built specifically to count steps and track motion. Additionally, Apple Music will be available on all devices, complete with the standard three-month trial.\n\nMatching the basic color lineup of the iPhone and iPad, the new iPod touch is available in gold, space gray, and silver, in addition to bright blue and pink.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the iPod Touch is a smaller version of the iPhone, just without the cellular connection. So why does Apple even bother making them then? Hint: Think small. The iPod Touch, in all its glory, is aimed at kids.\n\nThe iPod Touch is less expensive than an iPad and doesn\u2019t require stiff monthly fees associated with an iPhone cellular plan. At $199 for a 16 gigabyte model, parents are more likely to purchase one as a birthday or Christmas present than the bulkier and more expensive iPad. Although, it\u2019s important to note, the iPod Touch can get a tad pricey should consumers spring for the advanced 128 gigabyte model, currently priced at $399.\n\nApple\u2019s decision to keep the iPod screen to a meager 4-inches at first seems to go against the success spurred by the 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus respectively. However, the 4-inch screen just so happens to fit perfectly in a young persons hand; a detail Apple undoubtedly took into consideration.\n\nIn essence, the iPod touch is nothing more than a gateway drug for the next generation. It\u2019s a drug designed to lure kids into Apple\u2019s ever-growing ecosystem with the promise of an experience that only improves as users graduate to the next device.\n\nWe\u2019ll never know just how successful the new iPod lineup is since Apple stopped reporting unit sells earlier this year. Nowadays the company lumps iPod sales into an \u201cOther Products\u201d category along with the Apple Watch, among other things.",

        "text": "Domestic and intimate partner violence (DV/IPV) is a \u201cfamily secret\u201d in our Black communities. While I\u2019m not suggesting that all Black people think and function in similar enough ways that we could all be labeled simply as one \u201ccommunity,\u201d I do know we have pervasive problems that require nuanced discourse \u2014 especially in light of the national conversation about domestic abuse that has erupted over the last week.\n\nSince Ray Rice, former Baltimore Ravens running back, was indefinitely suspended because a video was released of him punching his then-fianc\u00e9e Janay until she was unconscious, there have been many conversations about violence between partners, and about the particular vulnerability of Black female victims. Much of the discussion has centered around the level of empathy and compassion shown toward victims like Janay, who choose to remain with their abusers.\n\nThese events have forced the country to face difficult truths about how prevalent domestic and intimate partner violence (DV/IPV) is in America. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an estimated 1.3 million American women experience DV/IPV each year. Women make up 85% of the victims of DV/IPV. Despite this, most cases are never reported to the police and most women are victimized by people they know.\n\nAnd for Black women, it\u2019s an even bigger problem: Black women are almost three times as likely to experience death as a result of DV/IPV than White women. And while Black women only make up 8% of the population, 22% of homicides that result from DV/IPV happen to Black Women and 29% of all victimized women, making it one of the leading causes of death for Black women ages 15 to 35. Statistically, we experience sexual assault and DV/IPV at disproportionate rates and have the highest rates of intra-racial violence against us than any other group. We are also less likely to report or seek help when we are victimized.\n\nThe reasons Black women suffer disproportionately from abuse are complex. Racism and sexism are two of the biggest obstacles that Black women in America face. But because many Black women and men believe racism is a bigger issue than sexism, Black women tend to feel obligated to put racial issues ahead of sex-based issues. For Black women, a strong sense of cultural affinity and loyalty to community and race renders many of us silent, so our stories often go untold. One of the biggest related impediments is our hesitation in trusting the police or the justice system. As Black people, we don\u2019t always feel comfortable surrendering \u201cour own\u201d to the treatment of a racially biased police state and as women, we don\u2019t always feel safe calling police officers who may harm us instead of helping us. And when we do speak out or seek help, we too often experience backlash from members of our communities who believe we are airing out dirty laundry and making ourselves look bad in front of White people.\n\nAccess to employment and economic self-sufficiency are also important. Racism has a disparate impact on Black people, men especially, who have, for the past six decades, consistently been held to an unemployment rate almost double that of white men. In a society that measures \u201cmanhood\u201d primarily by one\u2019s ability to provide, being denied access to the means to provide can cause some men to seek power through dominating women. For some men, the venting of anger turns violent and their partners suffer the greatest blows. Black women also face employment disparities, earning less than Black men and White men and women. This wage disparity limits available options and leaves many women, particularly mothers, feeling trapped in bad relationships where financial needs trump all.\n\nSpiritual beliefs and negative views about mental health services also factor into why many Black women remain with abusive partners. One in three Black Americans who need mental health treatment actually receive it, and we are more likely to rely on religious guidance and faith-based practices when working through relationship issues. Religious beliefs often discourage divorce, encourage forgiveness and occasionally condemns those who seek psychiatric services instead of relying on faith. Black women\u2019s perceptions of what constitutes abuse have been influenced by their negotiation of spiritual and mental health beliefs and how they have shaped our paradigms. Researchers have also found that Black women report feeling more obligated to fight back than to report abuse and that is reflected in the disproportionate rates of DV/IPV reported by Black men. Our attempts to embody the \u201cstrong Black woman\u201d stereotype have often done more harm than good, to us and those we love.\n\nThere is a lot we don\u2019t fully understand about the unique ways in which Black women endure DV/IPV because the lack of empirical research is indicative of what may simply be lack of empathy and concern for what Black women experience. I have been a fierce advocate for Black women and a mental health social worker for more than a decade and I have learned that we cannot win this fight if we don\u2019t acknowledge any such fight exists to begin with. We need to continue speaking out and social media has become valuable in helping victims share their stories and learn about resources that can help. We need to push for stronger laws that punish criminal abusers and we need to advocate for more treatment options for victims and abusers who seek help. We need to fund advocacy programs and supportive services for victims of DV/IPV and work on reducing the stigma attached to seeking help when one is in trouble. Most of all, we need to believe that Black girls and women are valuable, important and worth putting ourselves and our personal safety first, and in our society that might be the hardest thing of all.\n\nFor too long, the experiences of Black women have been ignored, particularly when it comes to those that affect our overall health and well-being. For centuries, our bodies and labor have been exploited to serve the needs of everyone but ourselves, and the physical and psychological toll can no longer be swept under the rug. Black women matter and the longer we remain invisible and have our dignity stripped and our humanity disregarded, the closer we get to the destruction of our families and communities. We must all work to end the marginalization of Black women and focus our energies on amplifying our voices and sharing what we go through at home, at work and in our communities.",

        "text": "\"The death of a man is like the fall of a mighty nation,\" declared Czeslaw Milosz in one of the many poems in which he speculated upon the experience of dying. The poem explains that the fall occurs because the nation is no longer mighty, \"its cities are empty, its population dispersed / . . . its mission forgotten, its language lost.\" Yet it is the death of this man that is like the fall of a mighty nation, but a nation full and undispersed, its mission honored and its language imperishable. The magnitude of Czeslaw Milosz, who died in Krakow on Aug. 14 at the age of 93, is almost unimaginable. He was a hero of the history of his time and a hero of the literature of his time. For friends and for strangers, for lovers of liberty and for lovers of beauty, he was, for more than half a century, an indispensable man. Milosz discharged his obligations to his age and his obligations to his soul with the same diligence and the same depth. The stability of his mind, its preternatural composure, was one of the great sanctuaries of the 20th century, a prophecy of the eventual emancipation. He had the rare gift of knowing how to be at once troubled and unperturbed. When light was needed, he was light; when stone was needed, he was stone. Milosz's spiritual intensity never interfered with his historical clarity. His inner freedom seems never to have failed him. His life and his work justified, in all their complexities, the most elementary belief in the power of the truth. He had the face of a hawk and the heart of a dove. He was as tough as time, or almost.\n\n\"Like many of my generation, I could have wished that my life had been a more simple affair.\" In the ancient and awful year 1951, with that quiet sentence, Milosz began \"The Captive Mind,\" his lucid and crushing analysis of the intellectual and psychological disfigurements of totalitarianism; and in that same year he defected from Communist Poland (he was the cultural attach\u00e9 at the Polish embassy in Paris at the time) and began his long and fecund exile in France and then in the United States. \"The Captive Mind\" is one of the classics of anti-Stalinism, which is to say it is one of the glories of an exceedingly inglorious period in the intellectual history of the West. Milosz insisted that the war against totalitarianism was at its foundation a war of ideas: \"It was only toward the middle of the 20th century that the inhabitants of many European countries came, in general unpleasantly, to the realization that their fate could be influenced directly by intricate and abstruse books of philosophy.\" The road from concepts to corpses was short and straight. But Milosz resisted the impulse to make a romance out of his side, out of the right side. \"Speculative thought is vile,\" he remarked in an essay on Pasternak. His revolt against one theory was not animated by another theory. \"My own decision proceeded not from the functioning of the reasoning mind, but from a revolt of the stomach.\" He always spoke of tyranny and its defenders with a kind of aristocratic disgust -- but he was liberalism's aristocrat, one of the princes of the faith that freedom comes first. Democrats are history's real nobles.\n\nAs a consequence of his many disputations with totalitarianism -- and of some of his early poems, such as \"Campo dei Fiori,\" the lament for the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto, \"the lonely / forgotten by the world,\" that he wrote in Warsaw in 1943 as the ghetto was burning -- Milosz became renowned as a witness to his time. This diminishes not only his achievement as a writer, but also his achievement as a rebel. For the struggle against Communism was also a struggle against historicism, against the belief in the sufficiency of history for the understanding of life. Milosz's teaching was that history was no more to be granted the last word. One does not live entirely, or even mainly, for one's time. The soul exceeds its circumstances. So even in his dissent, history did not command Milosz. Did the totalitarians justify their utopia with an ideal of totality? Then they could be vanquished by denying them the whole. He accomplished his severance from history in his poetry. In the bleakest hours of World War II, Milosz produced a masterpiece called \"The World,\" a sequence of 20 \"na\u00efve\" poems \"written in the style of school primers,\" in which the rudiments of a child's world -- the road, the gate, the porch, the dining room, the stairs, the poppies, the peonies -- are portrayed with the indomitability of genuine innocence. Against the horror, he pitted pastoral! And all the while he was working with the Polish underground. There were two ways, then, of resisting evil: engagement and disengagement; attachment and detachment; action against it and contemplation despite it. In his dark era, Milosz was the master of this complication, this salvation, of consciousness.\n\n\"They are incomprehensible, the things of this earth,\" he exclaimed in one of his many doxologies of the phenomenal world. His reading of East Asian poetry confirmed Milosz in his preference for poems that \"honored the object, not the subject.\" Oppressed by the reductions of the intellectuals, and in arms against their consequences, he chose to learn about things from the things themselves. The great depravity notwithstanding, he extolled \"the holy word: Is.\" All that he required for a justification of existence was a description of existence. \"Description demands intense observation, so intense that the veil of everyday habit falls away and what we paid no attention to, because it struck us as so ordinary, is revealed as miraculous.\" Is this mysticism? Not precisely, though it approaches Simone Weil's characterization of prayer as \"absolutely unmixed attention.\" I remember the long conversation in a wintry airport in 1982 when we cemented our friendship with the discovery that we shared an envy of mystics. His hostility to materialism carried this suave and profoundly modern man all the way to the old metaphysics. Milosz's otherwise withering intellect was gladly patient with mystery. In the traditional cosmologies, in the religious pictures of the world, he found unceasing stimulation, for his poetry and his philosophy. \"If I accomplished anything, it was only when I, a pious boy, chased after the disguises of the lost Reality.\" He was not embarrassed by the crudities of religion: they were the imagination's answers to the mind's questions. They created the \"second space\" (that is the title of a forceful collection of new poems that will be published, now posthumously, by Ecco Press next month) without which he saw no possibility of human flourishing.\n\nMilosz's verses speak often of God and often to God. But there was nothing settled or doctrinal about his God. The annals of suffering insulated him against some of theism's complacencies. \"Wandering on the outskirts of heresy is about right for me,\" he wrote not long before he died. He was just \"a chaplain of shadows.\" Milosz was indebted to religion not least for the pleasure of doubt. He experienced a religious crisis in his youth that rattled his Catholicism and \"set me searching.\" His journey led him not to churches but to saints, and to a conviction about the heterodox nature of truth: to \"modes of eccentric vision.\" (He admired even Swedenborg.) Milosz's journey was the antithesis of Cavafy's journey. \"Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey. / Without her you would not have set out. / She has nothing left to give you now,\" the Greek poet famously instructed Odysseus in \"Ithaka,\" one of the founding documents of modern irony. For Milosz, by contrast, the journey was not the goal, the goal was the goal. Irony, for which he had a wicked appetite, was not adequate as a meaning for life. He was a man without illusions, holding steadfastly to a confidence in what he could not see.\n\nHis confidence was vindicated. He survived the flood. The waters receded. He returned home. Finally his spirit could be unconvulsed by history. The lyrics abounded. But in recent months the news from Boguslawski Street was not good. Milosz was dying. There arrived a precious gift from his bed, a thin red volume with a detail from Titian pasted on its cover, called \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" a poem in memory of his wife, in which Orpheus is hailed as \"having made no rhyme in praise of nothingness\"; and in the inscription in Orpheus', I mean Czeslaw's, hand, I saw, for the only time in the years I knew him, evidence of weakness.

        "text": "Janet Yellen may be too modest.\n\nDuring her press conference, following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise rates for the first time in a year, she argued that that Fed policy was only \u201cmoderately\u201d accommodative\u2014a central banker term for pushing the economy along. That\u2019s despite interest rates sitting below 1% and the Fed\u2019s balance sheet remaining more than four times larger than it was before the financial crisis.\n\nDouglas Ramsey, for one, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group called this sort of characterization a \u201cshell game,\u201d in a recent presentation to investors, because it belies other statistics that show just how loose the central bank has been. Sure, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has shrunk modestly this year, and interest rates have risen since the end of the financial crisis. But Ramsey points out that Fed interest rate decisions are not the only factor to look for when determining the degree of accommodation provided. It\u2019s the interaction of the Fed, financial markets, and fiscal policy that really drives the economy.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s solid gains suggest that stocks have finally decoupled from the Fed\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d Ramsey writes. \u201cThe absence of [Fed bond buying to drive down rates] and December\u2019s rate hike doesn\u2019t mean that the stock market liquidity is set to dry up.\u201d He argues that we should also be looking at the growth of the money supply, which has accelerated this year. This growth in the money supply suggests some combination of increased bank lending and consumer willingness to keep their assets in ready-to-use cash. That this is occurring even as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet is evidence that central bank policy may be more accommodative, and potentially inflationary, than some observers believe.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this growth in the money supply is occurring at the same time that government debt is increasing faster again as well. \u201cThus, while Yellen is talking tougher than ever before (which is not so tough at all), policy makers appear to have no intention of imposing a \u2018cold turkey\u2019 end to the stimulus,\u201d Ramsey writes.\n\nThrow Donald Trump into the mix, and we may have a real problem. The president-elect has promised a mix of tax cuts and spending increases that would explode the deficit if enacted and impose inflationary pressures on the U.S. economy. The policies would also boost growth, at least temporarily. Yellen said during her press conference that while some of her fellow members had taken Trump\u2019s policy proposals into account in their predictions of the future path of interest rates, it was just one of many factors that lead a number of the central bank governors to predict that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates three times next year. The majority had only estimated two hikes back in September.\n\nThis dynamic, combined with the fact that wages seem to be on the rise, suggest that inflation could begin climbing faster than the central bank assumes. Another important point to consider is that while the Fed likes to look at the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure, minus expenditures on energy and food, to gauge price increases, other measure of inflation, like the Consumer Price Index, are already showing inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.\n\nThe Fed prefers PCE because it\u2019s a less volatile measure, but that also means that it could be slow in picking up signs of inflation that PCE is missing. And that it, like the Fed, could be behind. The economic outlook depends greatly on how the Trump administration will tax and spend in the New Year, but there is a good chance that Janet Yellen and company will have some catching up to do once those policies are in place.",

        "text": "The recent fraud and grand larceny conviction of socialite Brooke Astor's son, Anthony Marshall, highlights how dangerous a power of attorney can be in the hands of an abuser. Among the 14 counts the New York jury found Marshall guilty of: misusing his power by giving himself a retroactive $1 million raise to manage his mom's finances. (Marshall denied wrongdoing and is appealing his conviction.)\n\nThe Astor case is a reminder to families that it's important to make sure you get this basic estate and disability planning document right.\n\nA financial power of attorney gives someone you name--known as your agent--extraordinary powers. This agent can step into your shoes, acting on your behalf when it comes to handling your bank accounts, filing your taxes, and possibly even changing the beneficiaries of your life insurance and retirement accounts. While some powers are written so they only \"spring\" into action when you're incapacitated, out of the country or otherwise unavailable, most are written to be effective immediately upon signing. As a practical matter, however, your agent is unlikely to use the power when you're able to do things for yourself.\n\nIn an attempt to head off the sort of abuses highlighted in the Astor case and other cases, states have been rewriting their financial power laws recently. Legislatures have been spurred on by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which published a new model financial power of attorney law in 2006. This new model has already been adopted by Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Nevada and New Mexico, and is under serious consideration in other states, including Illinois, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nThe model law includes a suggested form designed for use by lawyers and, fortunately, non-lawyers too. When you fill out one of these forms, you are presented with a series of boxes asking whether your want to give your agent certain specific powers, including the power to make gifts from your assets and change beneficiaries on your life insurance or retirement accounts. These are powers that can be abused by a dishonest agent and so, appropriately, the boxes appear in a section of the form marked \"Caution.\"\n\nNew York recently adopted its own law that takes these precautions even further. It makes you fill out, in addition to the basic power of attorney form, a separate \"major gifts rider\" to authorize your agent to make gifts over $500. (Without the second gifting form, an agent can give only up to $500 a year to any individual or charity on your behalf, laughably low if you are incapacitated and want your agent to continue executing your estate plan.)\n\nOn the New York gift form, you can authorize your agent to make gifts that would qualify for the annual exclusion from federal gift taxes (currently $13,000 for each individual to whom you make a gift), write in a specific amount or specify an unlimited amount. If you want your agent to be able to make gifts to himself or herself--important if you're trying to pass money estate-tax free to a child who is acting as agent--you must say so. (For more on gifts to reduce an estate, click here.)\n\nIf you want to make other transfers in New York, such as changing beneficiaries of retirement plans, you have to write that out on the new gift form. \"The new law rejects the old do-it-yourself approach,\" says Michael O'Connor, an estates lawyer in Syracuse, N.Y. \"It's gotten too complex. It doesn't really work as a fill-in-the-blank form anymore,'' he complains.\n\nThe thinking behind all this is that spelling everything out will reduce opportunities for abuse. The new law, however well-intentioned, has created traps for New York residents. If you're one, read \"New York Law Creates Estate-Planning Trap\" for more for advice on avoiding those traps.\n\nMeanwhile, wherever you live, don't let the horror stories keep you from signing a new financial power of attorney. If you don't and you become incapacitated, a judge will have to appoint someone--possibly someone you wouldn't have chosen--to manage your affairs, warns Bruce Steiner, an estates lawyer with Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolf & Cohen in New York City.\n\nInstead, take these seven steps to protect yourself from the misuse of a power of attorney.\n\n1. Start with a state-suggested form.\n\nYou probably want to consult a lawyer before signing a new power, but you don't necessarily have to; 19 states offer residents a suggested financial power of attorney form. You can usually get the most recent forms, and learn about changes in state power laws, from a state's Attorney General or bar association. For example, the New York State Bar Association has information about New York's new powers law, which went into effect Sept. 1, at www.nysba.org/poaform.\n\n2. Get an updated power.\n\nIf your state has rewritten its law, your old power is still valid but it might not be interpreted the way you intended. Moreover, banks and other institutions sometimes balk at accepting outdated powers. Check to see that your power of attorney is not outdated. If you've moved recently, that's a compelling reason to update your power; currently only 15 states honor out-of-state forms.\n\nMost powers of attorney these days are effective immediately and durable--meaning they continue in effect if you're incapacitated. Alternatively, you can write a \"springing\" power that kicks in only if you're incapacitated. It will then require your agent to get a doctor (or even two) to certify you're out of it. Some lawyers counsel against a springing power; after all, if you trust someone to control your finances when you're incapacitated, why wouldn't you trust him or her when you're alert and monitoring all your accounts?\n\n4. Pick an agent with care and name a backup.\n\nPicking an agent (or in older lingo, an \"attorney in fact\") you can trust is just as important as having the right form and filling it out correctly. Typically, when you sign a financial power, you name a primary agent and a backup agent (say, your eldest child and second eldest) in case the first can't or won't take on the duty. Another safeguard: Specify that your primary agent can act individually to pay bills and handle other routine matters but must act jointly with the backup agent to make a gift or sell property. Both would need to sign the deed to sell your house and give away the proceeds.\n\n5. Put in record-keeping safeguards.\n\nConsider requiring your agent to sign a form agreeing to keep your assets separate from his and to keep a record of what he does on your behalf. Pennsylvania and New York require this, and the model law being pushed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has an optional form to do this.\n\n6. Think twice before giving away \"hot powers.\"\n\nYou'll have to decide whether you want to give away certain powers--say to make gifts, change beneficiaries on your retirement accounts and re-title bank accounts as joint accounts--that could change how your property is distributed at your death. Although these powers can be abused, don't be too hasty to deny them to your agent; he or she may be able to use them to reduce federal or state taxes on your estate or to fix oversights in the titling of your assets that could thwart the intentions in your will.\n\n7. Check what your bank and brokers require.\n\nYour brokerage firm or bank may demand you fill out a separate power of attorney using its in-house form. File it, but don't be lulled into thinking it covers anything but that specific account. In fact, you might need a handful of financial powers--a broad state power, a form for your bank and forms for each of several brokerage accounts.\n\nLawyer's Volunteer Work Helps Those With Chronic Diseases Plan",

Still pouring through every piece of evidence but by far the most difficult pieces to study --- are the images of her dead daughter. A lot of people will ask, how could a mother look at the photographs from an autopsy? I don't recommend it to any, any parent. But why did you? I had to. I became my daughter's investigator. I didn't have a choice. Reporter: And immediately there were clues. The kind she says only a mother would notice. The first, I was very shocked at um, looking at her eyes. Sheena and i, we wore the same mascara, and I knew that we, if you cry with this mascara on, that mascara just clumps up, your eyelashes are all clumped up and, and hers were perfect. Reporter: If sheena took her own life, there were no tears, which experts say is very rare. Her make up untouched. Reporter: Something else only a mom would notice -- that diamond bracelet they fawned over at christmas. Reporter: Kelly says it was on the wrong wrist. It is on her right wrist, and I knew that sheena didn't wear her bracelets on her right wrist. As a matter of fact, that video on christmas, when she got that bracelet, she takes that bracelet out of the box, and shows it, with her right hand and automatically places it on her left wrist. Reporter: The crime scene photos also show both the bathroom and the shower doors left open. Sheena's mother convinced she would never have done that with her babies - her two little dogs right there in the room. She would have made sure that her dogs didn't see her that way. One or both of those doors would have been closed. Reporter: And while that's what a mother noticed from those photos veteran crime reporter lee williams saw something else. There's a photo of sheena in the shower, her feet are caked with sand and debris, yet there's no debris on the white floor, on the shower or on the white floor of the bathroom immediately outside the shower. So her feet were caked in sand and yet there was no sand anywhere in that bathroom? None whatsoever. Other than on her feet. Reporter: For williams, sand on her feet and not on the floor around her, makes it nearly impossible to believe sheena killed herself in that shower. So either sheena was carried in there, post mortem, and hung. Or she somehow levitated into that room. Reporter: Kelly had the reporter on her side, but what she truly needed were some big names, forensic heavyweights. And she got three of them to look at all the evidence. One of them taking 20/20 went back to that very hotel room with her. Reporter: Jan johnson is one of those c-s-i experts who examined the evidence. She's spent more than 40 years studying crime scenes, and she immediately saw red flags. A pillow lying on the floor. I would be interested in what is on that pillow. Reporter: A veteran investigator would rule everything out, asking could that pillow have been used to smother her. You're thinking someone could have used one of these pillows to kill her. Absolutely. Reporter: Most telling the bathroom. Where she says crucial evidence was missed. This is where sheena was found hanging from a dog leash. That's correct. It's attached to the shower head. Clipped at the top. Extending downward. The noose around her neck. Her buttocks eight inches off the ground. She's extended toward the back side of the shower with her legs extended outward. Reporter: She's not suspended in midair. No. Reporter: Her legs are on the bottom of the shower. Flat. Reporter: Wouldn't that give somebody ample opportunity to pull themselves back up? Absolutely. Reporter: She points to her clothes, if she were convulsing she would expect the clothes to ride up the body. She points to the cuffs of her pants down around her feet and january says it looks like she was dragged into the shower. The pants are her-- extended outward. And you would have expected if she had, you know, walked her way down the shower wall and hung herself that the pants would've gone up her legs. I mean, her clothing is perfect. She appeared serene, like she had just fallen asleep. A hanging is a violent act. Towards the end, um, your body fights that, it fights the ligature. It struggles to get air, and there was no evidence of any of that. Her hair was perfectly in place. Yeah. And in fact you described it as tucked right behind her ear the way she typically would. It was like a mannequin that had just been pushed over on its side. I've never seen a hanging like that. Reporter: And one more red flag for jan and that entire team of experts was what they saw in sheena's eyes. When you looked at those images and saw she had popped blood vessels you thought -- she had been strangled. You usually see petechial hemorrhages in a strangulation, you don't often see them in a hanging. Reporter: The hemorrhaging in sheena's eyes they believe is more consistent with a violent struggle, a strangling and then the bombshell conclusion. All three experts weighing in, and in every one of their reports -- three words stood out, \"staged crime scene.\" And that's huge, that means that what was done to sheena was staged to make it appear as a suicide. What I think happened in that room that night is -- I think that she may have been suffocated on the bed and i think that she was dragged into the shower and placed into that leash that was already set up on that shower head.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.",

        "text": "Gowin has often pictured Edith naked, framing the female body as a sculptural form. Photograph: Emmet Gowin, Courtesy Pace/MacGill Gallery, New York\n\n\"She had just finished dancing with someone else, and as she approached me, I didn't think I'd ever seen anyone so alive.\" Photographer Emmet Gowin is remembering the night he met his wife, Edith Morris, in the 60s.\n\nSome of the most striking images he's ever taken \u2013 130 of which are on show in a retrospective at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris \u2013 focus on his wife, his most enduring subject. These \"established Edith as a person, and us as a couple\", he says. \"If you set out to make pictures about love, it can't be done. But you can make pictures, and you can be in love. In that way, people sense the authenticity of what you do.\"\n\nAs soon as the pair married in Danville, Virginia in 1964, he adopted her family \u2013 \"a feminine clan\" \u2013 wholeheartedly, and began photographing their everyday life and gatherings. Back then, art that focused on family was a total anomaly. \"I was asked by a journalist if the work is incestuous,\" Gowin says, mystified. \"Photojournalism was the modality. You were reporting on a broader world,\" he says of the expectations that arose during the Vietnam war period. \"We've got antecedents now \u2026 you can hardly find graduate work where people aren't doing things about their family.\"\n\nTo Gowin, it's never been hard to share intimate moments with Edith and his family. \"What's great is that the picture is already taken before it goes public. It's in secret. The trust that develops from such a habit engenders risk, and you realise you're not as vulnerable as you thought. Once you become comfortable with being more truthful about who you are, the easier it is, the prouder you become. That's the way it unfolded for us.\"\n\nHe has often photographed Edith naked, but her nudity has nothing coy about it; it's a plainspoken, fetish-free approach to the female body. His photographs show many tender nuances of womanhood, coupledom and motherhood, whether Edith is baring her breasts, nuzzling into her son Elijah's neck, spreading her legs with a nightgown lifted above her pelvis, or simply showing the nape of her neck. One particularly soulful portrait, taken in 1983, shows her, unclothed, perched on a windowsill with vines framing her. She looks like a wood nymph, yet human in the folds of her stomach and the dip of her breasts. Gowin's images of his wife manage to combine reverie and reality, veneration and humility.\n\nMoreover, his Edith portfolio is a prismatic look at age. The most recent portrait is from 1999, in which she looks rather severe, with round glasses, crinkled eyes, choppy hair and pursed lips. Similarly composed portraits taken in 1980 and 1994 flank each side in the exhibition, magnificently evoking the grace of ageing.\n\nGowin developed his style under Harry Callahan, at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence in the mid 60s. \"I made 10 times as many images as the other students,\" he says of the early years. \"I destroyed all those negatives except a few. I did it as a reminder that you can't afford to waste time: take it seriously.\" His early photography experience still resonates. \"As a good picture would come, I would never know exactly what I had done. When you did see it, it would strike you as a great surprise \u2013 who did that? How did it happen? Being surprised by your own work makes you both less serious and have serious reverence.\"\n\nIn 1967, he crossed over from student to teacher, taking a post at the Dayton Art Institute. Six years later, he was appointed to teach at Princeton, an establishment he stayed at until his retirement in 2009 (though he admits \"I could never have gotten into Princeton as a student\"). As a teacher, he rhapsodised about creativity so philosophically that, after the first class of every semester, students often had to double-check they were in the photography class they'd signed up for.\n\nIt's easy to imagine why they'd be thrown: over the course of our conversation, Gowin quotes James Joyce, William Blake, Diane Arbus, the Bible, Charles Darwin, Maya Angelou and William Henry Fox Talbot. This is not someone who plows linearly through a curriculum. His life and work have been fed by a perpetual sense of wonder at the world, a quest for beauty and an openness to transcendence. He describes his teaching role with awe: \"Going over ideas that you love, smoothing them out and presenting them to someone new ... to honour the thoughts you had yesterday tomorrow is a kind of refinement that brings you dignity. It gives you endurance and dedication.\"\n\nGowin's work, in the exhibition and more generally, can be cleaved into two periods. The family moments in his Virginia hometown peter out, and give way to sprawling global landscapes. It feels like a brusque change of scope. Gowin photographed landscapes, on the ground and aerially, from the early 1970s onwards. He travelled to the ancient Italian town of Matera, the archaeological site of Petra in Jordan, and spent several years chronicling the scarred topography of the American West.\n\nHe realises it disappointed fans when his family portraiture fell by the wayside, but he is unrepentant: \"The world is larger and more complex than that. You change as much as the world around you changes.\" Further, he says: \"The authentic thing is to follow your heart, your instincts, your emotions. If you located yourself in an idea, your life would be lived very sadly.\"\n\nIn the past few years, Gowin has made multiple trips to the tropics, studying devastated land and photographing nocturnal moths. On these expeditions, he travelled with a cut-out silhouette of Edith on trips she couldn't attend. \"It was extremely comforting to have her along. I got as interested in that as the insect pictures I was trying to take.\" His insect series incorporates Edith's silhouette, so while they may be a long way from his raw black-and-white snaps in Danville, the affection for his subject is just as heartfelt.",

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article is from the Globe archives. It originally appeared in The Boston Globe on Sept. 9, 2007.\n\nIn April of 2004, two Harvard undergrads walked into the Charles Hotel for a meeting with a venture capitalist. What happened next either highlights Boston\u2019s deficiencies as a greenhouse for a new generation of Web start-ups, or illustrates the incredible magnetism of Silicon Valley - or a bit of both.\n\nThe Harvard students were Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, and they were at the Charles to talk with a senior associate at Battery Ventures of Waltham. It was the senior associate\u2019s job to spot interesting companies for the partners at his firm to consider as investments. (The firm where this person now works allowed him to be interviewed only under the condition that he not be named.)\n\nHe\u2019d heard about the website that Zuckerberg and Saverin and a few other students had built because he himself was a Harvard alum, and a few days earlier, he\u2019d run into some current students who had told him about it. It was called Facebook, and at the time it only had 1,000 or 2,000 users.\n\nZuckerberg told the senior associate that he was planning to go to California for the summer, and he wasn\u2019t sure whether he would return to Harvard for his junior year. Summer was less than two months away. The senior associate was pretty sure that if Battery Ventures didn\u2019t invest before then, a Silicon Valley venture firm would discover the deal. For venture capital firms, getting in first can often mean getting a bigger chunk of a start-up for less money - especially if the start-up isn\u2019t talking to other firms. And Facebook wasn\u2019t.\n\nAfter a second meeting at the Charles, and a visit to Battery\u2019s offices above the reservoir in Waltham, Zuckerberg said he thought Facebook was worth about $15 million, and was willing to accept an investment ranging from $1 million to $3 million, which would have given Battery a substantial chunk of the start-up.\n\nBut Battery had already made an investment in an earlier social networking site, Friendster, which was foundering. Zuckerberg struck some partners at the firm as a little too brash. And no one was sure whether Facebook would appeal to anyone other than college students, its target.\n\nThere were also turf issues with Battery\u2019s Silicon Valley office, which had invested in Friendster. \u201cThere was a question about whether we on the East Coast side were going to lead an investment with a sophomore in college who was considering a move to the West,\u201d says the senior associate.\n\nThe firm passed - even though Scott Tobin, the Battery partner who evaluated the opportunity, could have invested a few hundred thousand in Facebook without putting the deal to a vote of all the partners. (Tobin had earlier invested in Akamai Technologies Inc., now a member of the S&P 500 index.)\n\nZuckerberg, who grew up in Westchester County in New York and attended Phillips Exeter, went to California in June 2004 with two of his Facebook cofounders.\n\nThrough a chance connection, Zuckerberg was introduced to Peter Thiel, a cofounder of the online payment system PayPal, who was running a hedge fund called Clarium Capital. He met with Thiel in August, at Thiel\u2019s office in downtown San Francisco.\n\nFacebook found its first financial support in PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel (left), who invested his own money in the venture. Thiel is shown with Elon Musk, his PayPal cofounder, in their Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters.\n\nThiel had also been an investor in Friendster, and he knew that the conventional wisdom was that all the social networking sites \u201cwere just fads that would come and go,\u201d he says. Thiel listened to Zuckerberg\u2019s pitch in the morning, asked him to go out and grab lunch, and by the time Zuckerberg returned in the afternoon, \u201cwe said we\u2019d invest, and we agreed to the basic valuation parameters,\u201d Thiel says.\n\n\u201dIt seemed like a good company,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMost of the time, we\u2019re not that fast.\u201d\n\nThiel put in $500,000 of his own money in return for 10 percent of the company.\n\nZuckerberg set up shop in Palo Alto, and by the end of the year, Facebook was approaching a million users. In 2005, the company took in $12.7 million from the Silicon Valley firm Accel Partners, and by the end of that year, the site had more than 5 million users, having decided to allow high school students to join.\n\n\u201dFacebook was perhaps the most controversial deal we\u2019ve done in several years,\u201d says Jim Breyer of Accel Partners. \u201cSome of my best friends in the business were wondering why we\u2019d write a check to a company that had very little defensibility to their business.\u201d Indeed, anyone could potentially build a better site and lure Facebook\u2019s users away.\n\nLast year, the company passed 12 million users, and raised another $27.5 million; this time, Greylock Partners, a Waltham firm that has a branch office in San Mateo, Calif., invested. Greylock partner David Sze, who works on the West Coast, admits that he had the opportunity to invest in Facebook in 2005, but says, \u201cI was too busy - I just didn\u2019t have the cycles to look at it. In retrospect, that was a mistake.\u201d\n\nFacebook now has 39 million users and is the sixth most popular website in the United States, according to the measurement firm comScore Inc. An average of 150,000 new users create a free Facebook account every day, according to the company.\n\nA Bear Stearns analyst recently estimated that the company, which has already spurned several acquisition offers, is worth as much as $6 billion, and will bring in about $140 million in revenue this year. That\u2019s with just over 300 employees.\n\n(Looming over Facebook\u2019s success - and any eventual public offering - is a lawsuit filed by several fellow Harvard students who allege that Zuckerberg built Facebook using software code he had originally written for their site, ConnectU.com, and that he also borrowed parts of their business plan. A Facebook representative said that none of its founders were available to comment.)\n\nWhat makes Facebook so appealing is that once users join and create connections with their friends and colleagues, it becomes an incredible hub of information: friends can share photos, tell you where they are, show what music they\u2019re listening to, what parties or conferences they\u2019re planning to attend, or how much money they\u2019ve raised for next weekend\u2019s charity walkathon.\n\nFacebook also decided, in May, to allow other companies to develop applications that users can easily incorporate in their profile pages. Each of these apps - there are now more than 3,000 of them, according to the tracking firm Adonomics - adds new features without the company investing a penny. And unlike MySpace, Facebook is allowing the companies that develop these apps to use them for marketing purposes or to make money, which provides a great incentive.\n\nSo even if Boston didn\u2019t end up as Facebook\u2019s home base, there are plenty of companies here now developing applications for it. Needham-based TripAdvisor, Inc. offers a world map that you can stick virtual pushpins in, to show your friends where you\u2019ve been.\n\nFafarazzi.com in Somerville has an app that allows Facebook users to send each other photos of celebrities, to reflect their mood. StyleFeeder Inc., a Cambridge shopping recommendation service, launched an app in June that has since been installed by 45,000 people.\n\n\u201dWe don\u2019t want to make Facebook the cornerstone of our growth strategy, but we\u2019re happy to ride the wave,\u201d says Dina Pradel, StyleFeeder\u2019s vice president of marketing.\n\nCould Facebook have succeeded if it had gotten an investment locally before Zuckerberg Co. went West, and kept its headquarters here?\n\nWhen I put that question to Accel Partners\u2019 Breyer, who is a native of Natick, he had a one-word answer: no.\n\n\u201dSo many of the Facebook employees have come from top Internet companies like Yahoo, eBay, and Google that the culture that has been built at Facebook is fundamentally more consumer Internet savvy than if it would\u2019ve been built anywhere else on the planet,\u201d Breyer says, after praising the engineering talent in Boston.\n\n\u201dFolks in the Valley are incredibly geo-centric to a point of snobbery,\u201d writes Battery Ventures\u2019 Scott Tobin via e-mail. He acknowledges that Silicon Valley is producing more companies than Boston but \u201cto make an argument that great companies can\u2019t be built in any one place is bunk in my mind.\u201d\n\nHe mentions Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash., and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego as examples. \u201cIt just takes a good driving attitude to make it happen.\u201d\n\nAs for passing on Facebook, \u201cthat may turn out to have been a mistake,\u201d Tobin admits.\n\nInnovation Economy is a weekly column focusing on entrepreneurship, technology, and venture capital in New England.",

        "text": "Digital scrapbooking site Pinterest is stepping into the spotlight in a big way. In recent months, the company has drawn attention through large funding efforts, high-level hires, and international expansion, but still has yet to reveal a proper revenue strategy. But the startup\u2019s recent actions signal not only that it is serious about growing its already impressive audience but also tackling that thorny monetization issue.\n\nPinterest raised $225 million in October, valuing the company at $3.8 billion. In September, Pinterest also launched an experimental (i.e. non-revenue generating) version of its \u201cpromoted pins\u201d campaign. Promoted pins will eventually advertise brands by incorporating company-sponsored pins \u2014 images that display crafts, fashion, recipes, etc. \u2013into the regular content that appears on a user\u2019s home page. This is Pinterest\u2019s second attempt at monetizing its content after an experiment in 2012 with affiliate link software Skimlinks. Then, users were upset by the lack of transparency in the affiliate links system. This time, Pinterest has plans to label more clearly which areas of the site are revenue-generating.\n\nMORE: More Americans are ditching their passports\n\nAs of Thursday, Pinterest also made available some of its real-time data software to developers who work for e-commerce sites. These tools will allow those sites\u2019 marketers to know which of their products\u2019 pins are trending, and they can use that data to display their popular pins to their customers on the partner\u2019s own site. So far, partners include such big names as Disney DIS , Random House , Target TGT , Nestl\u00e9, Wal-Mart WMT , and Zappos. Pinterest spokeswoman Malorie Lucich said in an email that one benefit of these partnerships is a seamless user experience on the sites. \u201cWhile you\u2019re browsing, you can pin directly from the site, so there\u2019s no need to interrupt your shopping, reading, or browsing.\u201d Pinterest is giving these tools away free to developers, but Pinterest\u2019s Steve Patrizi, head of partner marketing, told the Wall Street Journal that for users, this move is \u201cgood exposure \u2026 to see what Pinterest does.\u201d\n\nBuilding partnerships seems to be a current theme of Pinterest\u2019s. On Nov. 6, Pinterest announced that Joanne Bradford, San Francisco Chronicle president and overseer of its digital and marketing efforts, will join as head of partnerships. In her new position, she will be a liaison between Pinterest and advertisers, forging \u201cboth commercial and content partnerships globally.\u201d According to a statement from the Chronicle, Bradford already has plans to work closely with its parent company, Hearst Corp., to develop a content relationship between it and Pinterest. As head of partnerships, she\u2019ll lead Pinterest\u2019s sales team once the company starts selling advertising. She held previous positions in marketing and sales at Yahoo! YHOO , Demand Media DMD , and Microsoft MSFT , so her skill set will be useful in helping Pinterest break into more established digital revenue channels.\n\nMORE: Money manager arrested for defrauding hockey players of $15M\n\nOn the same day that Pinterest announced Bradford\u2019s new position, the company\u2019s CEO Ben Silbermann said at Fast Company\u2019s \u201cInnovation Uncensored\u201d conference that going public is \u201cnot the goal\u201d of Pinterest at this time. With more than 70 million users worldwide (current international markets include the U.K., France, Italy, and, most recently, Japan), the potential for advertising revenue is vast. Pinterest is following in the footsteps of companies like Twitter TWTR and Facebook FB by starting out with experimental revenue methods and building a strong team of executives. In 2007, Facebook had around 70 million users and made around $150 million in revenue. The following year, revenue increased to around $280 million. In 2010,Twitter had around 70 million users and made $28 million in revenue. In 2011, that number became $140 million. According to research from marketing and analytics software company Piqora, on average, a pin generates 78 cents in sales (this amount has increased by 25% since 2012). Once Pinterest begins to advertise on its site, the potential for revenue will skyrocket.\n\nJeff Jordan, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and investor in Pinterest, said that \u201cit\u2019s been extremely easy to stay interested\u201d in the company since his firm first invested in 2011. Pinterest\u2019s back-to-back news about funding, promoted pins, and new hires are all part of Pinterest\u2019s growth, according to Jordan. \u201cWhen you become one of the largest web properties almost overnight, and you have a very content intensive site,\u201d he said, \u201cscaling the business is a Herculean effort.\u201d",

He is now in Russia evading charges of theft of government property and of violating the Espionage Act.\n\nThe discussion, titled \u201cInstitutional corruption and the NSA,\u201d covered politics and policy, privacy, and the public\u2019s right to knowledge deemed secret by government agencies.\n\nSnowden started by saying that there are many \u201cdifficult questions that don\u2019t really have proper answers\u201d but that he would do his best to give clarity to the major issues revolving around his decision to become a government whistle-blower.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been struck by the number of people who have no clear sense of who you are,\u201d Lessig said, \u201cand what your values are as you came to work for the NSA, and the work you did by exposing the NSA.\u201d\n\nSnowden said he comes from a government family, who believed that \u201cfundamentally the government had noble aims and that it did good things.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cBut what I was not aware of and have grown aware of, while the people in government largely are there for the right reasons, there is a culture that pervades the upper levels, the senior levels that has become less accountable to the public they serve,\u201d Snowden said.\n\nThis realization, Snowden said, led him to uncover that a massive amount of surveillance was being done on Americans, surveillance that he said should have never happened.\n\n\u201cThey were happening beyond any possible statute for recording, based on the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that there were no reasons for much of the surveillance to exist and that very few people, including members of Congress and many of his co-workers, knew about the program.\n\nSnowden said he believed whistle-blowers are people who are standing up for something, in this case democratic right of free speech and privacy. But he emphasized that they should not dictate how the information is dispersed to the public.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to not dictating outcomes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut allowing the public a chance to participate in democratic processes.\u201d\n\nOne point Snowden emphasized was that he believed the United States has changed from focusing on the traditional way it did surveillance to mass surveillance but that it hasn\u2019t made the process any more effective. He argued that, in fact, spying is less successful.\n\n\u201cThis is the real challenge between what happened before and what\u2019s happening now in surveillance,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to collect information on everyone, and it\u2019s never been necessary.\u201d\n\nHe said the approach of massive surveillance, of listening to phone networks and hacking into websites, is actually making the United States more vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\u201cOnce you make a backdoor into something,\u201d Snowden said, \u201cyou can\u2019t control who walks in through it.\u201d",

But rarely is there a long line to leave a room.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened this afternoon, during a keynote interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nFor the past two years, the SXSW Interactive festival has been evolving its reputation as more than a place for big social media apps to \u201cbreak out.\u201d Last year, the festival focused on nerdier tech and science themes like 3D printing and space exploration. This year, there is an emphasis on politics and privacy, with keynotes from Assange and Edward Snowden.\n\nMORE: Will Ben Horowitz be launching his rap career at SXSW?\n\nThe controversial and outspoken anti-censorship advocate drew a crowd of approximately 5,000, packing almost every seat in auditorium. The problem? He wasn\u2019t actually there in person. (He has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012; the British government has been seeking to extradite him for a year.) Assange connected to Austin via Skype, and there were technical glitches. On first ring he didn\u2019t answer.\n\nAfter a rocky logistical start, the interview began slowly, with softball questions like, \u201cHow did you start Wikileaks?\u201d Despite that, Assange managed to offer a few choice Tweet-able sound bytes, such as:\n\n\u201cThere has been a militarization of our civil space, an occupation of our civilian space.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way to achieve justice is to expose injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a fool has no fear. Courage is seeing fear and still proceeding anyway.\u201d\n\nBut generally, the interview consisted of Assange embarking on detailed, elaborate, slowly drawn out answers which do not translate to an engaging Q&A. Making matters worse, opening up to audience answers awkwardly included two moderators \u2014 one from Skype and one from the stage \u2014 who often spoke on top of one another. Most of the audience questions didn\u2019t even come from the audience in the room \u2014 they came from Twitter. It felt more like watching a TV interview than attending an event.\n\nMORE: Ev Williams announces Medium for mobile\n\nThe audience grew restless and began pouring out of the room. That\u2019s (unfortunately) when Assange delivered one of his most inspirational answers for a South by Southwest audience of founders, hackers, and activists, encouraging them to follow in his footsteps.\n\nIn telling his story of fighting the British government, he said, \u201cI hope that gives people courage, that in fact, with a bit of help from your friends, and with some clear thinking and a lot of dedication, you can come to a position where you can stand up against these awful \u2026 great powers. You can outmaneuver then. You can do it.\u201d\n\nThe auditorium was half-empty by then.\n\nIt was a coupe for SXSW to snag an appearance from Assange, who does not frequently agree to interviews. Unfortunately, the Assange session made it clear that live, in-person guests trump remote appearances. SXSW\u2019s other big keynote speech, with Edward Snowden, will also take place via Skype. He\u2019ll be interviewed by Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, on Monday at 11 a.m. Central Time, from Russia, which granted him a year-long temporary asylum in August.",

Fortune periodically turns the spotlight on a different conference attendee to offer their personal insight into business, tech, and entrepreneurship.\n\n1. What is the best advice you ever received?\n\n\u201cJust keep pushing.\u201d In short, it pays to be persistent. Life always presents challenges on many fronts, and focusing where you want to go can keep you stable when your world around you is spinning.\n\n2. What was the last book you read?\n\nQuiet by Susan Cain. Found it both helpful for areas that I struggle with personally, as well as to help me have more empathy.\n\n3. What would you say to a group of young people looking to enter the tough job market?\n\nFocus on just doing not talking. In the end, what matters are your core skills and how you communicate them to others. Go build things that help you in life \u2014 whether interacting with friends, family and/or co-workers.\n\n4. What was your biggest missed opportunity?\n\nMy biggest missed opportunity was also the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I turned down the opportunity to be VP of engineering at Facebook FB several years ago in order to pursue the woman who is now my wife.\n\n5. How do you get your news?\n\nI primarily listen to folks that I have the privilege to meet with, the folks I follow on Twitter, and I read, in particular, academic journals, blogs, and the paper version of several periodicals. And then I contemplate while running and swimming.\n\n6. What was the most important thing you learned in school?\n\nThe importance of intense focus. The ability to shut out external \u201cnoise\u201d and apply your mind to one problem/thought is incredibly powerful. Frankly, I am finding this increasingly difficult to do in our attention economy.\n\n7. If you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be?\n\nPatagonia, Argentina. I had the opportunity to trek, mountain bike, and river raft there a couple of years ago \u2014 it is an amazing part of the planet! However, returning to the Buddhist monastery in Tengboche in Nepal also is quite appealing.\n\n8. What is your greatest achievement?\n\nFatherhood \u2014 without a doubt.\n\nProfessionally, I\u2019ve had the chance to be part of multiple teams that have built products now in use by both consumers and companies. From building an enterprise business out of my house, Composite Software, which remained independent with over 100 employees for 12 years until recently Cisco CSCO acquired, to helping redefine, build, ship webOS at Palm, and to rapidly expand the engineering team at Twitter to stabilize the infrastructure \u2014 I have been very fortunate to have had these opportunities.\n\n9. What business or technology person do you admire most? Why?\n\nBill Campbell. [The chairman and former CEO of Intuit INTU and current Apple AAPL board member.] Bill embodies deep empathy, deep experience, and deep care for people and companies. He is an amazing person and can provide insights and guidance unlike any other person that I have ever met. I am privileged to be able to call him a friend and mentor.\n\n10.

Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.\n\nHe's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.\n\nBut dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.\n\nThe outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.\n\nDr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.\n\nHe'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions.

        "text": "A FEW years ago \u2014 mid-2002 seems like another lifetime now \u2014 I was researching a book on Enron, and met a company executive for lunch. He was like so many people who worked there back in the good times: articulate, sophisticated, not just smart but astute about people in a way that would make the company's collapse all the more astounding when it occurred.\n\nThe most interesting piece of information he handed me was this: that he would much rather have been stranded on a desert island with Jeff Skilling, the company's brusque chief executive, than with Ken Lay, its well-liked founder. Up close, he promised, Jeff Skilling was good company; Ken Lay was not.\n\nThe jury that witnessed Mr. Lay's testimony last month and is now deliberating his and Mr. Skilling's fate on a combined 34 fraud charges might not be surprised by that assessment, but back then it was difficult to digest. I had been a Houstonian since 1976, and Ken Lay had emerged from the oil bust of the 80's as nothing less than a corporate visionary.\n\nEnron, for instance, was a groundbreaker in prohibiting smoking inside its shimmering high-rise office tower. So when you drove down Smith Street and caught sight of those nicotine addicts exiled to the sun-scorched pavement, the scene seemed to augur something new and advanced \u2014 a better way to live than that proffered by the old wildcatters who liked their whiskey, cigarettes and handshake deals.\n\nIf there was trouble among the colossal egos of local business leaders, Ken Lay brought them to the table and forced a compromise. If the African-American or arts community needed a hand, Ken Lay \u2014 and Enron \u2014 were there, insisting that a world-class city needed equal opportunity and edgy refinement to attract business, as opposed to bidness. When the Summit of Industrialized Nations was held here in 1990, Ken Lay was the man President George H. W. Bush tapped to make sure Houston put on a good show, and we did. The heat even broke.\n\nThat was the Early Ken Lay: the guy who knew what was best for you. Certain other facts \u2014 that Mr. Lay drank his coffee only from a particular kind of china cup, that he had a company plane's interior repainted during a layover because he didn't like the color, that in myriad ways he suggested that rules were for lesser beings \u2014 were all washed away in the sea of Enron's profits.\n\nOnce Enron imploded, we had to adjust to a different Ken Lay. The problem, former Enron executives explained, was that he didn't like to tell people no. Someone even told me, with a straight face, that Mr. Lay didn't have a head for business. Mr. Lay had been disengaged toward the end, they said \u2014 he wanted to be energy secretary, or work on a Middle East peace plan.\n\nSo Ken Lay held on to his public reputation as a good guy. It was assumed that the dark prince, Jeff Skilling, had played him.\n\nThen came the tsunami of news reports, investigations and books: the ones that described, in detail, the so-called Valhalla Incident, in which Mr. Lay in the 80's refused to punish two traders who had made illegal transactions because their revenues had saved the nascent company. The ones that contained accounts of all the executives who had warned him in vain that his company was in trouble, not just economically but morally. As we saw the embattled Mr. Lay on TV \u2014 on his way to church, carrying a Bible \u2014 we were left to wonder: is this man an idiot or a crook?\n\nBut if you sat in the courtroom during Mr. Lay's testimony, alas, you stopped asking yourself that question. For those who ascribe to the old saw holding that the personality of a company reflects the personality of the chief executive, well, the win-at-all-costs Ken Lay was there for all to see.\n\nAs one of his former executives, Mike Muckleroy, noted in his testimony, Mr. Lay tended to shade the truth under pressure as a businessman; and here Mr. Lay was, under pressure again, revealing the impatience, the imperiousness, the ungraceful eliding of unpleasant facts that matched the prosecution's earlier descriptions of his company.\n\nWhen the government lawyers showed evidence of his desperate attempts at self-preservation (tens of thousands of dollars in bills for antiquing trips and birthday parties while his company was tanking; announcing that he was buying more Enron stock while quietly selling $4 million worth), well, Ken Lay didn't look like a guy you'd want to be stranded on a desert island with, especially with one last coconut between you.\n\nAs the lead prosecutor, Sean Berkowitz, pointed out, the trial wasn't a litmus test of whether Ken Lay was a good person; it was about his character at Enron. Maybe Ken Lay will never be able to see himself for who he was, but by the time the jury took to their deliberations, most people in Houston felt they knew Ken Lay all too well.\n\nMimi Swartz, an executive editor of Texas Monthly, is the author, with Sherron Watkins, of \"Power Failure: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Enron.\"\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on , on page WK15 of the New York edition with the headline: The Three Faces of Ken Lay.

        "text": "And since 9/11, the workloads have grown heavier. Scores of officers, traumatized and stung by the loss of so many comrades, turned to the chaplains for solace, guidance and a prayer. Father Romano, for one, spent 10 months at ground zero and accompanied the body of every recovered officer as it was carried out of the pit.\n\nPolice Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly says the stigma that once kept many officers from seeking out a chaplain, lest they be seen as frail, has largely faded since 9/11. \"The shock waves were huge throughout the entire department,\" he said. \"For the first time, people saw the organization as a big nurturing family and seeking help was no longer a sign of weakness.\"\n\nThe chaplains, on call 24 hours a day, reflect the department's increasing diversity: there is the Rev. Luis Serrano, a Hispanic Pentecostal minister, the Rev. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook, a black Baptist and the first female chaplain, and Iman Izak-El Mu'eed Pasha, the unit's first Muslim religious figure who recently retired. (His replacement is being sought).\n\nWith their standard-issue navy blues and lapels glinting with insignia, the chaplains are, at first glance, indistinguishable from the rank and file. But they do not carry weapons and wherever they go, they are swept up in the embrace of high-ranking commanders, pimple-faced cadets and civilian 911 operators.\n\n\"I'm not Jewish, but I want this guy to do my eulogy,\" Detective Stephen Giaco said jokingly after giving Rabbi Kass a hug in the Midtown North station house where he works. \"That's because he'll make me sound like a better person than I really am.\"\n\nChaplains have the power to pick up a phone, call a commanding officer and wrangle out a resolution to a personality clash. They are also sworn to secrecy, something they tell each new class of police recruits.\n\n\"We're a shoulder to cry on and a sympathetic ear but a lot of what we do is troubleshoot for the officers,\" said Ms. Johnson Cook. \"We can cut through the red tape. And when it comes to the African-American community, sometimes I serve as a cultural translator.\"\n\nWith four decades on the force, Rabbi Kass is almost as recognizable around police headquarters as his boss, Commissioner Kelly. He is also a frequent presence at churches, mosques and Hindu temples. \"If there was an entry in Guinness Book of World Records for the rabbi who attended the most Catholic Masses, I would win hands down,\" he said with a boyish grin.\n\nRabbi Kass has had a colorful run: there were the death threats that earned his family months of round-the-clock security and a starring role in a hostage crisis that was resolved with a pastrami sandwich. Rabbi Kass persuaded the self-identified Jewish hostage-taker to exchange his guns for two Carnegie Deli sandwiches. Another mark of devotion to the job? He left his own son's bar mitzvah when he got word that an officer had been shot in the line of duty.\n\nAddressing a class of police academy students this week, the rabbi lectured the recruits about the lures of graft, the temptation to prejudge those of other ethnicities and, more profoundly, an officer's power to take away life.\n\n\"You are the only ones in society that can use lethal force,\" he said. \"None of you should ever shoot your gun lightly. And if you do, it should be done with great reluctance and sadness. It is when you shoot and not think twice, that you have lost your humanity.\"",

The movie\u2014which comes 20 years after the original and brings back much of the original cast, minus megastar Will Smith\u2014made only $41.6 million domestically in its first weekend in theaters, falling well short of blocking Walt Disney\u2019s animated sequel Finding Dory ($73.2 million domestically) from claiming its second-straight weekend box-office title.\n\nEmbarrassingly, the domestic opening for Independence Day: Resurgence didn\u2019t even gross as much as the 1996 original\u2019s debut haul before taking ticket-price inflation into account (the first Independence Day opened to $50.2 million domestically, which becomes $97.5 million with inflation). Various publications have already happily labeled Resurgence a \u201cflop\u201d and a \u201cbomb,\u201d while critics have more or less panned the film, which currently has a 33% \u201cfresh rating\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes (compared to the original\u2019s 62% rating).\n\nThere is no doubt that Resurgence is a disappointment for 20th Century Fox, as well as for fans, but it is worth noting that the movie\u2019s unimpressive North American debut did not stop it from topping all movies last weekend in worldwide box office, thanks to a $102 million haul overseas, according to ComScore. That strong international debut gave Resurgence an overall opening gross of $143.7 million, which should allow the film to easily top $200 million in global box office after the upcoming holiday weekend (even if it sees a week two sales drop-off of more than 50%).\n\nNow, none of this erases the fact that Fox would have obviously preferred a much bigger domestic opening for Resurgence, especially with no major blockbusters likely to be among this weekend\u2019s new releases. (Disney\u2019s The BFG and Warner Bros\u2019 The Legend of Tarzan are the biggest names, but both could also fall short of Finding Dory, which is a summer powerhouse with almost $400 million in global box office over a couple of weeks.)\n\nA decent comparison for Resurgence is Terminator: Genisys, last year\u2019s disappointing franchise reboot from Viacom\u2019s Paramount, which didn\u2019t even crack $90 million in domestic box office but still made more than $350 million overseas. Terminator: Genisys was far from a glowing success, but it did surprisingly well in China, a booming movie market where Resurgence already made $37 million last week.\n\nResurgence is sure to fall well short of being the box-office behemoth its predecessor was in 1996\u2014when Independence Day made more than $300 million domestically, along with another $500 million overseas. But, the sequel should still ride a decent international box office gross to avoid becoming a financial disaster for Fox and maybe even shake off the \u201cflop\u201d label.",

While responding to every email may seem daunting, Adam makes it a point to do so. \u201cEveryone acknowledges, respects and appreciates a response. I reply to literally every single email that I get from a founder.\u201d\n\n2. Know each investor\u2019s individual interests.\n\nResearch individual investors and not just their investment firm. \u201cYou think every investor is going to be interested in the company that you are building,\u201d Adam said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake a lot of founders make is that they think every investor is the same.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the case. Instead, Adam said, \u201cEvery investor has certain metrics or qualities that they place a higher emphasis on.\u201d Entrepreneurs need to identify those qualities for each investor and determine if they match them.\n\n3. Build relationships before you need to.\n\nAdam\u2019s most important pieces of advice for founders: \u201cReach out to investors before you\u2019re ready to raise,\u201d he said.\u201cThe worst time to get to know someone is when you actually need to know them.\u201d\n\nBuilding investor relationships takes time. By getting to know investors early on, you can \u201cget feedback on what you\u2019re building [and] try to build a relationship and a dialogue with them leading up to when you actually need their capital,\u201d Adam said.",

        "text": "Since last Sunday, U.S. and Coalition forces have launched more than 125 airstrikes against targets in Iraq and Syria as part of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, killing at least 250 ISIS fighters and destroying ISIS training camps, weapons facilities, and fighting positions.\n\nAs important as the strikes were, they were not always led by the most senior officer participating. Instead, as the aircraft delivering ordinance screamed towards their objectives at speeds of 700 MPH, each strike was led by the best pilot for that mission, on that day, no matter his or her rank.\n\nIt is a concept that holds particular resonance for U.S. business, given the current demographic shift underway. About 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring daily, according to the Social Security Administration, a hemorrhaging of talent that will result in a large loss of institutional knowledge and leadership skills and will only get worse as more reach retirement age.\n\nAccording to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management, 36% of organizations have started to look specifically at how this demographic shift will impact their operations, and over half already run programs to transfer knowledge from older workers to younger workers.\n\nWhile these programs often take the form of mentoring and job-shadowing, the military might offer a more powerful model.\n\nAmongst fighter pilots in the U.S. and Israel (which is not participating in Operation Inherent Resolve), determining which pilot will be in charge of a mission is not purely determined by seniority. Rather, it comes down to an assessment of who is best at the skills required for each mission.\n\nNot only does this system demonstrate the value of assigning people to a task based on their experience and expertise, it also offers younger officers crucial management and leadership skills via experiential learning. \u201cThis is a great opportunity to develop future leaders on the job,\u201d said Dr. Homa Bahrami, senior lecturer at the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\n\nIn this system, the responsibility for leading a flight extends to the mission briefing and debriefing. In these meetings, pilots\u2014sometimes as young as 24 or 25 if they are First Lieutenants\u2014have to critically evaluate their superior officers, who can hold ranks up to General.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a religious ritual, the debriefing,\u201d said Brigadier General Uri Oron, head of Israeli Air Force Intelligence, during a U.S. tour with the Israeli Air Force Center Foundation. Most of the time, he said, younger officers lead the missions on which he flies.\n\n\u201cWhen the door closes on the flight debriefing, we have a saying that, \u2018The hats come off,\u2019\u201d said Major Jack Trombetta, an elite test pilot and U.S. combat veteran now based at Edwards Air Force Base. \u201cWe have our ranks on our hats, but your rank does not mean anything when you are in the flight room.\u201d\n\nSenior officers, like all pilots interviewed, greatly value these evaluations, and will sometimes even criticize their subordinates for not pointing out the errors they, the senior officers, committed. This kind of leadership trickles down, Trombetta notes, as pilots will often self-identity mistakes they made. Beyond improving their abilities, pilots recognize the value of a culture that allows for an open exchange of ideas and a skills-based meritocracy.\n\nStarting in flight school, pilots are inculcated with the importance of being able to put their egos aside in the debriefing room, something that is not always so easy to do for men and women whose competitiveness is sacrosanct (and, in fact, selected for).\n\n\u201cThe hyper-competitiveness is there, it has to be, that understanding that you want to be better than everyone around you,\u201d said Trombetta. \u201cBut you prove how good you are in the airplane. You don\u2019t prove how good you are in the debrief.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of debriefings, which can last hours, is to review the mission and every pilot\u2019s performance. These reviews can be extremely granular in nature. Pilots can expect to have their every eye movement and hand placement analyzed, in particular during engagement with the enemy, on a second-by-second basis in some cases.\n\nBeyond analyzing performance during a dogfight or bombing run, debriefings also cover administrative phases of the flight, such as takeoff and landing, as well as safety issues. No one in the room is able to hide, and it is not always easy for the pilots to take the incisive criticism.\n\n\u201cInitially it is very tough. Many of us have lived a life where we are handled with kiddie gloves,\u201d said Trombetta. \u201cPeople say you should sandwich a criticism with two compliments. That is not something we do here.\u201d\n\nHaas lecturer Bahrami said that while some areas of the business landscape are employing management structures similar to the pilot culture\u2014notably software\u2014the trend is not as evident in areas like sales and marketing.\n\nBut as all companies navigate through digital transformation and more Millennials enter the workforce, Bahrami expects to see more of these progressive leadership structures emerge.\n\n\u201cHierarchical pyramids won\u2019t be sufficient in this much more volatile, complex world of today,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat brought you here won\u2019t get you there.\u201d\n\nFor companies that want to implement these new management structures, Bahrami preaches a slow, methodical process, one which is outlined in an online course she wrote called \u201cAccelerating Change Readiness & Agility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would encourage businesses to thoughtfully experiment,\u201d she said, recommending short trials where, for example, someone is put in charge of a particular team and given a clear understanding of their responsibilities and the time-limited nature of the experiment.\n\n\u201cYou experiment, you escalate, and then you launch\u2014the mistake is to escalate way too prematurely,\u201d she said.\n\nBahrami has seen the benefits of this kind of progressive management structure throughout Silicon Valley, but cautions that it is very context-dependent. \u201cOne size does not fit all,\u201d she said.\n\nBut if this culture of openness, based on merit, can serve sectors as different as combat aviation and Silicon Valley, it might hold value for other industries that also want to draw out optimized team performance while developing young leaders.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we are as good as we are is we get all the lessons learned,\u201d said Trombetta. That\u2019s important in any industry, but vitally so in one where, as Trombetta notes, the main goal is to, \u201cKeep our guys alive and rain some hate on the enemy.\u201d",

        "text": "Greece agreed to harsh terms for a new three-year bailout on Tuesday and vowed to push it through parliament this week, despite mounting dissent in the ruling left-wing party.\n\nWith the country facing the risk of a debt default next week, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had sought to speed up the talks and get approval of a deal this week.\n\nAfter Greece and its creditors reached an accord on the main points on Tuesday, Tsipras called for an emergency session of parliament for a vote late Thursday.\n\nGreece needs to start tapping the new bailout \u00e2\u0080\u0093 worth $93 billion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so that it can make a key debt repayment next week and secure its future in the euro.\n\nThe draft agreement forces Tsipras to accept what he had vowed to resist only months ago: the sale of some state property and deep cuts to pensions, military spending and ending tax credits to people considered vulnerable.\n\nOfficials in Athens and the European Union said a few issues were left to be ironed out Tuesday.\n\n\"We are very close. Two or three very small details remain,\" Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said as he emerged Tuesday morning from all-night discussions with creditors.\n\nThe European Commission, a key negotiator in the talks, confirmed the progress. Annika Breidthardt, the Commission's spokeswoman for economic affairs, said the details were expected to be cleared up later in the day.\n\nDissenters in Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party, who want to end bailout talks and return to a national currency, promised to fight the deal, describing it as a \"noose around the neck of the Greek people.\"\n\nTsipras requested an end to the summer recess to allow for the two-day approval procedure and to get a vote before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Friday.\n\nThe agreement still requires approval from higher-level representatives, and senior finance officials from the 28 EU nations were holding a conference call Tuesday.\n\nGermany, the largest single contributor to Greece's two previous bailouts and among the toughest negotiators so far, remained cautious on the timing for a final deal. \"We will have to examine the results that come in the course of today,\" deputy finance minister Jens Spahn told n-tv television.\n\nInvestors cheered the news of progress.\n\nGreece's government borrowing rates fell on Tuesday, a sign investors are less worried about a default. The 2-year bond yield dropped by 4.2 percentage points to 14.73 percent. The Athens Stock Exchange, which reopened recently after being shut for five weeks during the most severe part of Greece's financial crisis closed up 2.1 percent.\n\nCash-strapped Greece needs more money by Aug. 20 at the latest, when it has a debt repayment of just over $3.3 billion to make to the European Central Bank.\n\nThe government insisted it has also gained key concessions from lenders: greater control over labor reforms, avoiding a \"fire sale\" of state assets, and softer deficit targets.\n\nIt said it had agreed to have a 0.25 percent government deficit this year and a 0.5 percent surplus next year, when not counting the cost of servicing debt. Those so-called primary surpluses would rise to 1.75 percent in 2017 and 3.5 percent in 2018.\n\nThe surpluses are more ambitious than those of many European countries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Spain, for example, is not expected to achieve a primary surplus before 2018. That's largely because the creditors want to make sure Greece is able to start paying off its debt load as soon as possible.\n\nThe government claims the creditors wanted even more ambitious surplus targets, and that the targets it agreed to mean it will be able to spare the country budget cuts worth about $22 billion.\n\n\"This practically means that with the current agreement there will be no fiscal burden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in other words new measures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the immediate future,\" the government said in a note.\n\nBanks will be strengthened with new cash infusions by the end of the year and will have an immediate boost of \"at least 10 billion euros,\" or $11 billion, it said. The government insists this means there is no longer any danger that the banks may have to raid bank deposits to restore their financial health.\n\nThe government also said that banks will not make repossessions and auctions of primary residences will not occur within 2015.\n\nGreece has relied on bailouts worth a total $263 billion from eurozone members states and the International Monetary Fund since concern over its high debts locked it out of bond markets in 2010. To secure the loans, successive governments have had to implement spending cuts, tax hikes and reforms.\n\nWhile the austerity has reduced budget overspending, the measures compounded a deep recession and pushed unemployment to a record high. Figures next week are expected to confirm that Greece's recession deepened in the second quarter.\n\nThough the government was elected on a staunchly anti-austerity platform in January, it has been forced into a policy U-turn after bailout talks came close to collapse last month.\n\nWhile Greece's parliament ratified further tax hikes and reforms, the rebellion by hardline Syriza lawmakers has left Tsipras' party with only a nominal parliamentary majority.\n\nThat has stoked speculation that Tsipras will call early elections after the bailout deal is signed. Tsipras still retains strong personal support in opinion polls, which show Syriza heading for a potentially big victory.",

        "text": "Documenting \u2014 which is a version of collecting \u2014 existing collections like these constitutes a genre of its own in the show. In a 2013 video called \u201cThe Trick Brain,\u201d the contemporary British artist Ed Atkins adds terrifically creepy spoken commentary to an old film tour of the personal art collection amassed by the French Surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton. Beginning in 2005, the Swiss photographer Mario Del Curto began to photograph the astonishing architectural structures by the Canadian artist Richard Greaves on a patch of woodland in southern Quebec, each an immense assemblage of discarded matter held together by wire, and all now destroyed.\n\nAnd in 1993, the Austrian artist Oliver Croy and the critic Oliver Elser rescued almost 400 tabletop-scale models of imaginary Swiss buildings from junk shop oblivion. They were all made from cardboard, matchboxes and magazine tear sheets, by one Peter Fritz (1916-1992), an insurance clerk from Vienna about whom nothing further is known. A sampling of the Fritz collection \u2014 or is it the Croy and Elser collection? The show deliberately confuses the roles of collectors and artists \u2014 is at the New Museum. A group was also included in the main exhibition of the 2013 Venice Biennale, \u201cThe Encyclopedic Palace,\u201d organized by Mr. Gioni. Approximately a third of the participants in \u201cThe Keeper\u201d were also in that Venice show.\n\nThe Danish artist Henrik Oleson was, too, though he\u2019s at the New Museum with different work, his 2007 survey piece called \u201cSome Gay-Lesbian Artists and/or Artists relevant to Homo-Social Culture Born between c. 1300-1870.\u201d A maze of funky digital prints attached to panels, it approaches art history through a queer eye, dividing it taxonomically by such categories as \u201cThe Appearance of Sodomites in Visual Culture,\u201d \u201cFemale Societies, Amazons, Myths\u201d and \u201cSome Faggy Gestures.\u201d It\u2019s no-such-thing-as-too-much-information brilliant.\n\nIt\u2019s also quite personal, as the most absorbing work in the show is. Some of it has a reliquary air. Howard Fried, a California-based Conceptualist, exhibits the wardrobe of his mother, who died in 2002. The dark, fetid-looking assemblages of the reclusive Hannelore Baron (1926-1987) were made in the security of her Riverdale, Bronx, home but are saturated with a sense of panicked fatalism instilled by the Holocaust, which she had narrowly escaped.\n\nThat event is the subject of the show\u2019s single most piercing entry: reproductions of pocket-size pencil drawings, probably dating from 1943, that are eyewitness depictions of the daily horrors of life inside Auschwitz, as recorded by an artist who signed the pictures MM. (The original sheets, found stuffed in a bottle, are in the collection of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.)\n\n\u201cEstrela de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o\u201d by Arthur Bispo do Ros\u00e1rio.\n\nWhat emotions propelled that artist\u2019s hand? Fury? Despair? A spirit-focusing, nerve-steadying desire to deliver truth to history? We can\u2019t know. Spiritual love was the force behind the work of the Swedish mystic Hilma af Klint (1862-1944), whose 16 paintings here are the largest number I\u2019ve ever seen in New York, and are alone worth a visit. Her mind was on history, too. She asked that her paintings be hidden away for 20 years after her death, by which time, she hoped, a new age would have the eyes for them. It did.\n\nBut if she had not lived a middle-class life and been academically trained, would her paintings now be slotted as \u201coutsider art\u201d rather than classic early Modern abstraction? As it is, the outsider label hovers uncertainly over the Berlin artist Vanda Vieira-Schmidt, who turns out streams of abstract drawings, sometimes hundreds a day \u2014 300,000 are stacked in a gallery here \u2014 in the belief that they prevent evil from destroying the world.\n\nAnd the label falls squarely on the career of Arthur Bispo do Ros\u00e1rio (circa 1910-89), a Brazilian artist who, after reporting that he\u2019d had a visit from Christ and some angels, was committed to an asylum where, using unraveled clothing and rubbish, he created tapestries, arklike ships and a line of celestial formal wear, all on view in the museum\u2019s lobby gallery.\n\nYet art isn\u2019t outsider just because it looks that way. If that were true, the market would have long ago jumped on Shinro Ohtake, a highly regarded Tokyo noise-rock musician, who has for decades been compiling cut-and-paste scrapbooks that suggest bulging, eruptive crosses between Rauschenberg \u201ccombines\u201d and Warhol \u201ctime capsules.\u201d\n\nYuji Agematsu, his contemporary, would be a big outsider name, too. A New York City resident since 1980, he sifts bits of organic matter from the streets \u2014 cigarette butts, chewed gum, pins \u2014 and encloses them in tiny cellophane wrappers. The results, which resemble mini-terrariums or museum vitrines, do the heroic job of preserving a culture\u2019s base matter but are as portable and personal as talismans.\n\nAs to the view of art\u2019s being essentially talismanic, there\u2019s a museum-within-the-museum devoted to the idea here, in the form of an installation called \u201cPartners (the Teddy Bear Project)\u201d by the German artist Ydessa Hendeles. Designed as an insanely neat, claustrophobically dense ethnological display on two levels, it holds some 3,000 framed photographs, many from early-20th-century family albums, of people and teddy bears posed together, and a few vintage examples of the real thing.\n\nThe teddy bear was introduced to America around 1902 \u2014 Germany also lays claim to inventing it \u2014 as a homage to President Theodore Roosevelt and quickly assumed an independent pop-cultural life. Ms. Hendeles, multitasking as artist, curator and collector, has arranged her pictures in units of classification to illustrate some of the toy\u2019s social uses: political mascot, emblem of class status, embodiment of commercial success, protector of childhood innocence, adult comforter in a harsh universe. (Ms. Hendeles is a child of Holocaust survivors who lost everything in World War II.)\n\nAs an object, single or multiplied, it serves the basic function that collecting \u2014 call it hoarding, call it installation art \u2014 does. It lets us keep the illusion that we can forever embrace, and be embraced by, what is forever fading away.\n\n\u201cThe Keeper\u201d continues through Sept. 25 at the New Museum, 235 Bowery, Manhattan; 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org\n\nA version of this review appears in print on July 22, 2016, on page C17 of the New York edition with the headline: Made, Found and Collected: So Many Things.

And some change those categories every quarter. You\u2019ve got to be a spending ninja to maximize your payoff.\n\nBut let\u2019s not pick on cash-back cards. Many other rewards programs are just as tricky, with byzantine rules that tend to change regularly. No wonder only three in five rewards cardholders understand\u2014or think they know\u2014how their cards work, a J.D. Power survey found. And almost 20% of cardholders didn\u2019t redeem any rewards last year, NerdWallet reports.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t taking full advantage of the cards in your wallet, though, you could be walking away from hundreds of dollars a year. \u201cLots of consumers are costing themselves money by not understanding what their credit card does,\u201d says NerdWallet credit card expert Sean McQuay.\n\nNow is an especially good time to revisit your options.

Once again MONEY has teamed with NerdWallet, sifting through thousands of credit cards to identify 14 that are best in class. We\u2019ve highlighted outstanding options in five categories\u2014cards that offer cash back and travel rewards, specialized services for students and small businesses, and the best financing terms.\n\nMost of our picks assume you are using cards strategically to maximize rewards, and paying off your bill each month to avoid fees and finance charges. (Most also require good credit\u2014a score of roughly 700 or above.) Yet MONEY went one step further this year. At the top of each broad category is our \u201ceasy choice\u201d\u2014the best no-muss, no-fuss, no-annual-fee option. That\u2019s because while the benefits can be rich, maximizing rates and rewards is a lot of work\u2014and not for everyone.\n\nMONEY decided the criteria to consider\u2014including intro and regular APRs, sign-up bonuses, fees, and rewards\u2014and then set parameters for what constituted a winner in each category (for example, lowest rate and no annual fee for student borrowing). NerdWallet plugged those terms into its database and made several suggestions for each category; it disclosed to MONEY any issuers from which it receives compensation when people apply through its site. MONEY then independently fact-checked the results and made the final decisions.\n\nRead next: Find the Right Credit Card for You",

If nobody is afraid of me, I'm meaningless.\"\n\n\"Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle-dusters. If you think you can hurt me more than I can hurt you, try. There is no way you can govern a Chinese society.\"\n\n\"If you are a troublemaker... it's our job to politically destroy you... Everybody knows that in my bag I have a hatchet, and a very sharp one. You take me on, I take my hatchet, we meet in the cul-de-sac.\"\n\n\"You take a poll of any people. What is it they want? The right to write an editorial as you like? They want homes, medicine, jobs, schools.\"\n\n\"We have to lock up people, without trial, whether they are communists, whether they are language chauvinists, whether they are religious extremists. If you don't do that, the country would be in ruins.\"\n\n\"If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society... So what happens? There will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation. That's a problem.\"\n\n\"You know, the cure for all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government. You get that alternative and you'll never put Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again... and your asset values will be in peril, your security will be at risk and our women will become maids in other people's countries, foreign workers.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call myself an atheist. I neither deny nor accept that there is a God. So I do not laugh at people who believe in God. But I do not necessarily believe in God - nor deny that there could be one.\"\n\n\"Without her, I would be a different man, with a different life... I should find solace in her 89 years of a life well lived. But at this moment of the final parting, my heart is heavy with sorrow and grief.\"\n\n\"There is an end to everything and I want mine to come as quickly and painlessly as possible, not with me incapacitated, half in coma in bed and with a tube going into my nostrils and down to my stomach.\"\n\n\"Even from my sickbed, even if you are going to lower me to the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up.\"\n\nPeople pay tribute outside the Singapore General Hospital where elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBarack Obama said after meeting the still-healthy Mr Lee at the White House in October 2009 that \u201cthis is one of the legendary figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries\u201d.\n\nHe had set Singapore on a path that has seen average incomes rise 100 times, with investments across the globe, a widely respected civil service and world-class infrastructure.\n\nBut he was criticised for his iron-fisted rule, forcing several opposition politicians into bankruptcy or exile, and once invoked Machiavelli in declaring: \u201cIf nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless.\u201d\n\nMr Lee\u2019s political career spanned 30 years as premier and 20 years as senior government adviser.\n\nBut in his last years, he was a shadow of his old self as his health deteriorated following his beloved wife\u2019s death in October 2010.\n\nHe remained revered by many but also became the target of scathing attacks in social media as some Singaporeans began to muster the courage to speak out against him and the political and social model he had bequeathed.\n\nThe statement from the Prime Minister's Office that was posted on Facebook\n\nHis impact, through his policies and via his son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is likely to be felt for years to come.\n\nLee Kuan Yew first became prime minister after Britain granted Singapore self-rule in 1959 prior to its stormy post-colonial union with Malaysia.\n\nBorn to a 20-year-old father whom he described as a \u201crich man\u2019s son, with little to show for himself\u201d and a 16-year-old bride in an arranged marriage, Mr Lee grew up thinking British colonial rulers were invincible.\n\nHe had a rude awakening during World War II after Japanese invaders easily overran British forces and took over Singapore in 1942, shattering the myth of European supremacy in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe dark ages had descended on us. It was brutal, cruel,\u201d Mr Lee said of the Japanese occupation, calling it \u201cthe biggest single political education of my life because, for three and a half years, I saw the meaning of power\u201d.\n\nMr Lee survived massacres of civilians and at one point worked for Japanese propaganda. After liberation, he left to study law at Cambridge, where he secretly wed his classmate Kwa Geok Choo before returning home in 1950.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shares a toast with Singapore's then Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in 2006 (AP)\n\nHe was shaken by Kwa\u2019s passing after more than 60 years of marriage and admitted that \u201cat this moment of the final parting, my heart is heavy with sorrow and grief\u201d.\n\nThey had three children, the oldest of whom is Lee Hsien Loong. Daughter Lee Wei Ling became a doctor, and son Lee Hsien Yang became a top corporate figure.\n\nMr Lee stepped down as prime minister in 1990 and handed power to his deputy Goh Chok Tong, who in turn gave way to the veteran leader\u2019s elder son in 2004.\n\nIn 2011, he stepped down as a cabinet adviser after the ruling People\u2019s Action Party suffered its worst performance yet in a general election, its share of the vote falling to a low of 60 percent.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office said arrangements for the public to pay respects and funeral arrangements will be announced later.",

In just the past few years, entirely new sports have been invented as more and more money, time and passion have been pumped into a rapidly developing industry.\n\nQuintanilla travels to Salt Lake City to meet three members of the \"GoPro Bomb Squad\" \u2013 Neil Amonson, Marshall Miller and Jesse Hall \u2013 and watches as they jump from Notch Peak, 9,000 feet above sea level, wearing wingsuits and soaring at speeds of up to 120 miles an hour. The group is paid by camera maker GoPro to live out their passion of skydiving, BASE jumping and wingsuit flying. After Amonson used one of the company's cameras on a BASE jump and posted the video to YouTube, GoPro took notice, eventually signing him and his friends to its roster of 130-plus athletes. Sponsorships of elite athletes have helped raise GoPro's visibility and have sent revenues soaring over the last five years.\n\nCNBC boards a ship headed to the Bahamas for a three-day cruise where 1,400 fitness fanatics participate in a Spartan obstacle race. \"Spartan Race\" is just one of the competitors in the field of obstacle course racing, a growing cultural phenomenon which also includes \"Tough Mudder\" and \"Warrior Dash.\" Together, it's a business expected to take in $350 million in entry fees alone in the U.S. in 2015. Carl Quintanilla participates in the three-mile, sixteen obstacle race, complete with a fire jump, barbed wire crawl and spear throw. He speaks with Joe De Sena, a former Wall Street trader who created Spartan Race in 2010. De Sena's tough love philosophy: \"You have to get people right to the line where they wanna quit. And if you get to that line and then bring 'em back, that's an experience they'll never forget.\"\n\nCNBC also meets action sports legend Travis Pastrana during a stop on his 40-city North American Nitro Circus tour, which is expected to bring in some $35 million in ticket sales. Pastrana has earned 17 medals in the X-Games and is the first person ever to complete a double back-flip on a motorcycle in competition. His Nitro Circus arena show consists of 40 performers in constant motion, soaring through the air on everything from motorcycles to skateboards \u2013 and even a wheelbarrow. Ranked among America's most promising new companies, Nitro Circus has quickly grown into the biggest and most successful live action-sports show of all time. According to Pastrana, the secret to its appeal is three-part: \"You go as fast as you can. You go as high as you can. You go as far as you can.\"\n\nQuintanilla heads to Maui to get a first-hand lesson in the extreme sport that has become a favorite of the tech elite \u2013 kiteboarding. He speaks with prominent venture capitalist Bill Tai and pro kiteboarder Susi Mai \u2013 who together are the force behind \"MaiTai Global\" \u2013 part extreme sports camp, part network of the top minds in tech where entrepreneurs, investors and pro-athletes come together to kite, party and make deals. \"There's a certain kind of person that will look at a pro rider flying through the air and think, 'I could do that,'\" explains Tai. \"And I think that's exactly the kind of person that goes into a startup.\" Quintanilla follows two \"MaiTai\" first-timers hoping to find backers for their new product, and speaks with a former SVP at Twitter who's come to Hawaii looking to invest in the next great tech idea.\n\nCNBC also profiles 31-year-old Amelia Boone. By day, Boone is a bankruptcy attorney in Chicago, but on weekends, she sheds her corporate skin and competes as one of the best obstacle course racers in the world. Her drive to win is extreme: just eight weeks after undergoing knee surgery, Boone ran in a 24-hour long race, covering 75 miles and winning the women's division. CNBC cameras cover Boone in action at \"The Spartan Beast,\" a 12.5 mile race in New Jersey where competitors trudge 4,800 feet up muddy ski slopes and tackle 32 obstacles. Boone wins the race 20 minutes ahead of the next female finisher. Her proven strategy: \"Bring myself to that brink \u2013 and keep pushing.\"\n\nAlong with these astonishing pursuits, there is also the very real element of danger and even death. CNBC examines the risk involved in some extreme sports. Since 1981, more than 250 people have died in BASE jumping accidents alone. Quintanilla talks with several athletes featured in the hour about walking the fine line between adrenaline and actual danger.\n\nFor more information including web extras, log on to: cnbcprime.com/extreme-sports.\n\nFollow @CNBCPrimeTV on Twitter, and join the conversation using hashtag #EXTREMEsports.\n\nMitch Weitzner is Senior Executive Producer and Vice President of Long Form Programming.

Scott and others used falsified documents, including claims that the buyers planned to live in the condos.\n\nThe buyers were told they wouldn\u2019t have to put their own money into the investments, that the mortgages would be covered by rents, and that they would share in the profits on the properties.\n\nThey soon learned that what seemed too good to be true was, indeed, just that. Their experience was detailed in a Boston Globe investigation in 2009.\n\nA real estate broker involved in the scheme, Joan Ruggiero, 78, last week was sentenced to nine months in prison and nine months of home detention for her role in what the government called a conspiracy to defraud mortgage lenders of $4 million on more than two dozen properties in Dorchester.\n\nShe also was ordered to pay a fine of $100,000 and restitution of $4.1 million to the lenders. Ruggiero pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy in 2013.\n\nIn October, a lawyer involved in the fraud, Michael R. Anderson, 46, of Framingham, was sentenced to two years in prison and two years of supervised release.

And a lot more change is on the way, prompting the discount retailer to invite Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz this week to come rally the Target troops.\n\nAround this time in 2014, Target parted ways with former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, reeling from a devastating data breach a few months earlier, seeing its results brought low because of an ill-advised, now abandoned expansion into Canada, and having lost its ability to dazzle customers with the cheap chic ethos that had made it the third largest U.S. retailer.\n\nMany have blamed that low point on what was seen as the 54-year old retailer\u2019s bureaucratic, insular culture, one where teams were focused on meeting their numbers rather than what was best for the company overall. The result was the loss, at least partial anyway, of Target\u2019s magic touch: the ability to be a discounter that offered middle class customers cool, stylish items in addition to the basics one would come to a general merchandise retailer for. This was after all, the retailer that had brought you Michael Graves home goods, and Isaac Mizrachi clothes on top of toilet paper.\n\nBut Target lost its way, focusing on low prices during the recession to compete with Walmart wmt and not enough on the cool merchandise core to its customer proposition. It was also resistant to change, a very dangerous stance at a time of upheaval in retail, and slow to embrace how tech was changing shopping.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it may be because Starbucks sbux underwent a similar traumatic time in the preceding decade. The coffee chain had over-expanded its fleet, become a bloated bureaucracy and lost sight of what had made it work. And CEO Howard Schultz, who came back to the company in 2008 as it floundered, had a lot of advice on how to cope, and indeed thrive, under change to impart to workers at Target, where it has cafes at 1,300 stores in a partnership that goes back to 1999.\n\n\u201cOur brand comes to life by uplifting our people. So when I stopped hearing my team having conversations about the people and the coffee, and only focusing on the numbers and getting bigger, faster \u2026 that\u2019s when I realized something was wrong,\u201d Schultz told Target workers this week as part of series of talks from leading industry figures on innovation.\n\nTarget has made a lot of progress in the last two years. Under the leadership of Brian Cornell, Target has redoubled its efforts on the digital front, yielding 31% e-commerce growth last year and helping it begin to bridge the gap with rivals like Amazon amzn and Walmart. And it comparable sales have grown faster than Walmart\u2019s for several quarters now.\n\nTo foster innovation, Target is supporting a retail tech accelerate program with Techstars, while on the merchandise front, the retailer has landed collaborations with cool brands likes of Lilly Pulitzer and Marimekko. It is also working with MIT on an urban farming project, and testing out far out store concepts in Los Angeles. Some of that has been painful too: under Cornell, thousands of jobs at headquarters have been cut to reduce bureaucracy and make Target more nimble, and there have been many changes at the retailer\u2019s top echelons. Target last year also ditched in Canada and sold off its pharmacy business to CVS Health. cvs .\n\nStarbucks, meanwhile, has to continued to innovate, developing the most successful app in retail and hospitality, one that is behind 21% of U.S. sales. The coffee company offers mobile offering, putting it leap years ahead of pretty much any competitor. Last year, Starbucks\u2019 global revenues hit an all time high of $19 billion.\n\nSchultz told the Target audience that focusing on the basics was the key to the Starbucks\u2019 renaissance. \u201cFor the Starbucks team, it all comes back to one person, one cup, one community, and getting the details right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed to get back to basics, the values that our customers fell in love with in the first place.\u201d",

But in the rainforests of Thailand, Africa and Brazil, Camponotus leonardi ants get pulled off course by Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, a parasitic fungus (pictured above).\n\nA spore first infects an ant foraging on the rainforest floor, then spends 3-9 days developing inside its body. When the fungus is ready to complete its life cycle, it manipulates the worker to plod blindly away from safety, like a zombie.\n\nA study in 2009 found that the ants always went to similar locations: around 25 cm up a tree, in a spot with just the right amount of humidity for the fungus to grow. The ant then clamps down on a leaf with its mandibles, and dies.\n\nWithin 24 hours, fungal threads emerge from the corpse. Finally, a stalk pushes out of the ant and begins raining spores onto the rainforest floor, where they can infect more ants. It's a bit like the chest-bursting scene from Alien, except that the ant is mercifully dead when the fungus explodes out of its head.\n\nKamikaze horsehair worm (Paragordius tricuspidatus)\n\nOne of these worms can grow up to a foot long, and look like a cooked piece of spaghetti. But to get to that point, it needs a house cricket or grasshopper to do its bidding.\n\nThe worm coerces the cricket into jumping slap bang into the nearest body of water\n\nFirst, a tiny horsehair worm larva is eaten by the larva of another insect, such as a mosquito or mayfly. Once this emerges from the water, a cricket or grasshopper will snatch it up. Then the horsehair worm begins to develop inside the cricket in earnest.\n\nBut the worm's final stage of development takes place in water. The cricket wouldn't normally swim, or even hang out near water, so the worm must get it there.\n\nBy altering the functions of the cricket's central nervous system, the worm coerces it into jumping slap bang into the nearest body of water. The hapless cricket then drowns itself, allowing the horsehair worm to emerge and reproduce.\n\nFrom the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell if a cricket had been infected, but neurologically, the worm is in control. Ben Hanelt of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who studies the worms, says he has seen a whopping 32 worms pushing themselves out of one luckless host.\n\nIf you think making a cricket believe it can swim is impressive, this parasitic barnacle takes body-snatching to another level.\n\nA Sacculina barnacle enters a host crab by finding a chink in its claw joints. The barnacle sheds its hard shell and squeezes itself in. At this point it looks more like a slug than a typical barnacle stuck to the underside of a boat.\n\nIt then sets up home, leeching off the crab's nutrients and turning it into the vehicle that will allow it to reproduce. Once fully-grown, the barnacle looks more like a soft, pulsating egg yolk.\n\nIf the crab is female, Sacculina forces it to care for the millions of barnacle larvae as if they were her own. But if the crab is male, it will be feminised in order to do the same thing. Not only is it rendered infertile, it grows a larger abdomen to carry the barnacle's young, its gonads shrink, and it stops developing its fighting claws.\n\nIf you see a snail with two beautiful eye stalks, pulsating with emerald- and olive-green stripes and dappled with charcoal grey flecks capped off with a maroon dab, be impressed. You're not just looking at a pimped-out snail, you're looking at a snail infected with a parasitic flatworm.\n\nThe green-banded broodsac first squirms its way into the stalks of the snail, so that they look like juicy, pulsing, brightly-coloured caterpillars. This is just the kind of snack nearby birds are in the mood for.\n\nThen the worm manipulates the snail's behaviour. In 2013, Wanda Wesolowska and Tomasz Weslowski of Wroclaw University in Poland found that the infected snails behaved differently from their apparently non-infected counterparts. They positioned themselves in more exposed and better-lit places, situated higher in the vegetation. This probably makes the snails more conspicuous for foraging birds.\n\nOnce eaten by the bird, the worm can reproduce, and the cycle continues.\n\nThis wasp needs a host that will protect its eggs from potential predators. So what better bodyguard than an insect with markings that suggest danger?\n\nLadybirds may seem like the stuff of cartoons and cute lunchboxes, but they can take care of themselves. When disturbed they emit a disgusting poison, and their hard shell with its bright red and black spots warns off predators. But they don't stand a chance against the parasitic wasp, which leaves behind a single egg with one sting.\n\nAfter the wasp egg hatches, the larva chews through the ladybird's internal tissues before bursting through the abdomen to spin a cocoon between its legs. The ladybird is now a \"bodyguard\", standing guard over the cocoon. Still alive despite everything, it will thrash and twitch its limbs if a predator approaches. It's not clear why it behaves like this, but it may be triggered by venom left by the larva.\n\nRather unexpectedly, a 2011 study found that a quarter of the zombie ladybirds survive the assault.\n\nEmerald cockroach wasp (Ampulex compressa)\n\nThe emerald cockroach wasp has a metallic body that glows emerald with bright crimson markings on two of its legs. Found in the tropical regions of Asia, Africa and the Pacific islands, it is a beautiful insect, but pity the cockroach that crosses its path.\n\nIt is one-sixth the size of a roach, but that doesn't stop it. First it delivers a simple paralysing sting. Then it hijacks the roach's mind, injecting an elixir of neurotransmitters into its brain. This turns the roach into a helpless zombie.\n\nAfter a quick suck of recharging roach blood, the wasp chews off the roach's antennae and leads it to its nest like a dog on a lead. There it lays its eggs on the roach's abdomen, and barricades it in with pebbles. But the hapless roach doesn't even try to escape, even though it physically could. It just sits there submissively, as the wasp larva eats it alive. Finally the adult wasp bursts out of the cockroach's remains.\n\nThis single-celled creature is perhaps the most famous of all host-manipulating parasites, perhaps because it operates close to home. It mainly infects rats and mice, in order to be eaten by a cat so that it can reproduce.\n\nBetween 30 and 60% of people are infected by T. gondii\n\nInfected rats and mice lose their fear of the smell of cats, according to a 2007 study. Instead, they become attracted to a pheromone in the cats' urine. The animal becomes less likely to hide under the floorboards and more likely to sniff around its feline predators, putting the parasite on course for its ultimate destination: the cat's stomach.\n\nBetween 30 and 60% of people are infected by T. gondii. But it's less clear that the parasite affects human behaviour. In 2006 Kevin Lafferty of the US Geological Survey in Santa Barbara, California found some evidence of personality changes in people infected by the parasite. So far this is only a correlation, which is far from conclusive. Nevertheless, Lafferty says: \"my money is on cause and effect\".\n\nToxoplasmosis is also unusually common in people with schizophrenia, but again it's not clear what that means or how significant it is. \"Schizophrenia is a complicated syndrome, perhaps with multiple causes,\" says Lafferty. He adds that there are plenty of infected people that don't have schizophrenia, and plenty of people with schizophrenia who aren't infected. \"Still, I am comfortable in saying that Toxoplasma is a correlated risk factor for schizophrenia.\"\n\nYou might not think of a virus like rabies as a parasite, but to a biologist that's exactly what they are. \"I would call rabies and flu parasites, because they generally reduce the fitness of their host, or benefit at the expense of their host,\" says Levi Morran of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nRabies is one of the most frightening parasites, because it seems to blur the line between humans and animals. The virus is spread through saliva, usually from a scratch or bite. It makes animals \u2013 usually dogs and bats, and occasionally humans \u2013 more aggressive, compelling them to spread the virus through biting and scratching.\n\n\"Rabies manifests itself with a wide range of neurological signs, including changes in behaviour but also loss of motor control,\" says parasite expert Andres Gomez of ICF International in Washington, DC. \"The latter sometimes include difficulties with swallowing that eventually lead to hunger, hypoglycaemia, and dehydration.\"\n\nSupposedly, it creates a fear of water, but this is a myth. \"Patients have involuntary spasms when trying to drink and later when presented with water,\" says Gomez. \"But it's not fear.\"\n\nYes, that's the flu. In 2010 Chris Reiber of Binghamton University in New York and her colleagues found evidence that the influenza virus makes people more sociable.\n\nThey found that people given a flu vaccine interacted with significantly more people, and in significantly larger groups, in the 48 hours after being exposed, compared with the 48 hours before. The infected hosts were more likely to head out to bars and parties.\n\nIt's only one study, and quite a small one, but it does make a certain sinister sense. It would benefit the virus if its host passed it on to as many people as possible, before the symptoms started and they became bedridden.\n\nParasites are everywhere. Most species will be living with more than one parasite, and even parasites may have their own parasites. So in some cases, a host may be carrying multiple parasites with different agendas, who must battle for control of the host. This is particularly likely if one parasite is ready to move onto another host, but the other isn't.\n\nIt was as if the younger tapeworm wasn't there\n\nTo see this happening, Nina Hafer and Manfred Milinski of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen, Germany infected small crustaceans called copepods (Macrocyclops albidus) with multiple tapeworms (Schistocephalus solidus). These tapeworms ultimately need to move onto a fish host called a stickleback, and to get there they manipulate the copepod's behaviour. It becomes more active, and thus more likely to be spotted and eaten by a stickleback.\n\nIf two tapeworms were both ready to move hosts, their effect on the copepod's behaviour was even stronger, suggesting they were working together.\n\nHowever, if an older tapeworm that wanted to leave was sharing the host with a younger tapeworm that wasn't yet ready, the host copepod still became active. It was as if the younger tapeworm wasn't there.\n\nHafer and Milinski argue that the older tapeworm was effectively sabotaging its younger competitor.",

In fairness, he has latched on to a couple of reasonable, if not very original, issues \u2013 we could use better broadband, for example. But his 10-point plan mostly consisted of re-heated 1960s-style state-sponsored corporatism of the kind that was already completely discredited three decades ago, mixed up with some of the hard-left socialism that has turned Venezuela into a basket-case. His plan would certainly transform Britain, just as he promises \u2013 but unfortunately only by creating mass unemployment and national bankruptcy.\n\nCorbynomics was a snappy phrase. But even after Corbyn was installed as leader of the Labour Party last autumn, it didn\u2019t have much substance to it. There was some fanciful talk about 'People\u2019s QE\u2019, and an impressive looking collection of economists were assembled to forge some 'radical new policies\u2019, but nothing else in the way of concrete plans ever actually emerged from the rhetoric. Corbyn was against austerity, in a general placard-waving sort of a way, but what he was actually for he never quite got around to telling us.\n\nUnder pressure from his leadership challenger, whose polices, such a wealth tax and higher corporation taxes, are more Citizen than Owen Smith, Corbyn has finally gotten around to setting out his plans in slightly more detail. Apparently, there is an urgent need to \"rebuild\" a \"broken\" economy, and he has the ideas on how to achieve that.\n\nOf course, you might want to question the premise. While the British economy has plenty of problems, from stagnant productivity, to a vast trade deficit, to an over-heated property market that has made it hard for many people in decent jobs to afford to buy a home, it is an exaggeration to describe it as \"broken\". This is a country with record levels of employment, with a faster rate of growth than most of our major rivals, and with a rate of start-ups that is fast making the UK one of the most flexible and entrepreneurial societies in the world. Broken is surely too strong a word.",

Even those that aren\u2019t that special. Case in point: TACO PAC is an organization which, according to a statement that greets you at taco-pac.com, \u201cprovides a way for individuals to join their contribution and voice with those of other Taco Bell Franchisees and supporters. Contributions are made to candidates who advocate and pursue governmental policies that promote a favorable business environment for the QSR industry in general and Taco Bell franchisees in particular.\u201d And, apparently, Taco Bell Franchisees and supporters are super-into Republicans.\n\nAccording to Open Secrets, the defenders of Fourth Meal have donated to campaigns as far back as 1998. And while they have always given more to Republicans than to Democrats, things became quite lopsided starting in 2010. That year coincided with both the Citizens United decision, which decimated campaign contribution limits, and the rise of the tea party. While one could argue this was a coincidence, that argument seems like it\u2019s based on logic as authentic as the meat in a Crunch Wrap Supreme. In 2008 TACO PAC donated a total of $24,500 to political candidates\u2014$20,000 to Republicans, $4,500 to Democrats. In 2010, in an off-year election no less, it donated a total of $299,250 to candidates\u2014$293,250 to Republicans, $6,000 to Democrats. That\u2019s a lot of money to protect America\u2019s fast food tacos.\n\nSo far this year, TACO PAC has donated $53,625 to Republicans and $3,500 to Democrats. And while in absolute dollars it has only given the relatively small sum of $5,000 to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, that does place it in elite company: Only four other committees have donated that much to the campaign according Insidegov. That\u2019s nice for Trump, especially considering he has shown clear preference for other fast food franchises.\n\nRelated: What Does It Mean That Donald Trump Likes His Steak Well Done?\n\nThe vast majority of PAC contributions to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns come from their respective victory funds, but it\u2019s still interesting to see who else is standing behind each candidate. One of the other $5,000 donors to the Trump campaign is the also-edibly-named PANCAKE PAC\u2014a catchall organization that claims to represent restaurant owners. In this political age when moneyed interests often give to both political parties, it\u2019s also worth noting that neither TACO PAC nor PANCAKE PAC has given any money to the Clinton campaign.\n\nSo the next time you time you think about running for the border, know that at least a little of your money is going to someone who plans to wall it off.",

Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, in a blistering letter to the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.\n\nSaying he had \u201cdeep concerns with the lack of clarity about the program,\u201d Mr. Yingling said the confusion had grown sharply this week over what the government\u2019s purpose was.\n\nThe bank lobbying group said the main confusion was over whether the purpose of the program was to shore up healthy banks, as Mr. Paulson has insisted, or to rescue failing ones.\n\nMr. Yingling said he was alarmed that lawmakers in Congress were criticizing the Bush administration for its reluctance to impose tougher restrictions on banks that accept government money. Some Democratic lawmakers have complained that banks are taking taxpayer money with one hand while paying out dividends to shareholders with the other. Some policy makers have also complained that banks are not lending enough and might be paying their executives too much.\n\nSince the Treasury Department introduced its plan, officials have stressed that their goal was to strengthen healthy banks and get them to revive their lending. Officials are also encouraging the takeovers of sick banks by healthy ones, as they did last week when the Treasury approved the bailout program\u2019s purchase of $7.7 billion of preferred shares in PNC Financial Services and rejected an application from National City Bank, based in Cleveland. National City quickly agreed to a takeover by PNC.\n\nBut the focus on healthy banks has created baffling contradictions. Healthy banks have been reluctant to take the government money, in part because they feared being stigmatized as needy or vulnerable.\n\nMr. Paulson essentially strong-armed several of the country\u2019s biggest banks into participating when he announced the program earlier this month.\n\nTo attract healthy banks into the program, Treasury officials also imposed as few restrictions as possible for those that received money. Banks could still keep paying dividends. They had only limited restrictions on executive bonuses and compensation. And the government would not force the banks to make loans they did not want to make.\n\nBut that only raised the question: why was the government trying to give those banks money in the first place?\n\nAndrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, sent letters to the nine biggest financial institutions on Wednesday, demanding a \u201cdetailed accounting\u201d of the next round of bonuses they planned to pay.\n\nMr. Yingling said many healthy banks might want to take advantage of the Treasury\u2019s offer, but not if they had to suspend dividends or accept restrictions on executive pay.\n\n\u201cIt would make no sense for a well-capitalized bank with solid earnings to agree to a program which would greatly lower the value of its stock,\u201d Mr. Yingling wrote.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Some Banks May Tell U.S. to Keep Bailout Cash.

Stylists have publicists. Tag teams are rare. But joining forces in 2007 allowed Mr. Zangardi and Ms. Haenn, both former stylists for MTV\u2019s on-air personalities, to play up their different strengths and sensibilities. Ms. Haenn veers toward hip-hop (her first styling job was on the set of the video for Trick Daddy\u2019s \u201cTake It to da House\u201d). Mr. Zangardi is more pop: \u201cMandy, Britney, Christina Aguilera, the boy bands,\u201d he said the other day over coffee with Ms. Haenn at the Soho House here in West Hollywood. Ms. Haenn grew up in Brooklyn, Mr. Zangardi in Ohio.\n\n\u201cMariel is the bad cop,\u201d Mr. Zangardi said.\n\nMs. Haenn said: \u201cLook, I\u2019m comfortable being like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not my favorite,\u2019 or, \u2018No, I don\u2019t like that,\u2019 even if they do. They get used to getting that from me and getting what Rob brings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ohio versus New York,\u201d Mr. Zangardi said.\n\nTheir first joint effort was styling Rihanna\u2019s 2007 \u201cUmbrella\u201d music video, which featured computer-generated water splashes and a series of good-girl-gone-bad ensembles (a leather romper, a low cut baby-doll dress). More work for the singer followed: a horned headpiece from Rihanna\u2019s \u201cRockstar 101\u201d video sits on a shelf in the duo\u2019s studio here, though Rihanna is no longer a client. In 2009, Andrea Lieberman, a stylist whom Ms. Haenn looked up to, moved away from longtime clients like Ms. Stefani and Ms. Lopez to start her own clothing line, A.L.C. Ms. Lieberman said she was relieved to see her star clients end up working with a strong team.\n\n\u201cIt was important to me that when I left both women, they were in supremely good hands,\u201d Ms. Lieberman said about Ms. Stefani and Ms. Lopez. \u201cI knew Rob and Mariel had it. They seamlessly could edit the best of the world of fashion with the world of music and had an incredible work ethic. It was a no-brainer for me to suggest them both to Jennifer and Gwen.\u201d\n\nMs. Lopez recalled her first meeting with Ms. Haenn and Mr. Zangardi, in 2011. \u201cI found them to be shy and kind of quiet, but they had their point of view,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started working together, little by little, and it worked really well. Those things you can\u2019t really force, you have a sensibility or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Zangardi and Ms. Haenn have since scripted many head-turning moments for Ms. Lopez: the mustard colored, cape-capped Giambattista Valli gown she wore to the Golden Globes in January, the crystal-studded Dsquared2 bodysuit she opened the American Music Awards with in 2015. The bodysuit was displayed in a glass case, along with Ms. Lopez\u2019s other sartorial hits (that green Versace dress), outside a recent \u201cAll I Have\u201d performance in Las Vegas. Mr. Zangardi was there to ensure that the array of outfits Ms. Lopez would wear that night were ready for the spotlight. \u201cShe\u2019s sliding on the floor in boots that are rhinestone that we have to recrystal every day,\u201d he said. (Ms. Haenn was in Japan with Ms. Stefani.)\n\nThey work out of a windowless, fluorescent-lit studio, jazzing up dancers\u2019 mall-bought outfits with safety pins and sequins (the budget for the backup crew is not what it is for marquee performers). In the back, a dozen bins of Spanx are stacked next to racks of old costumes worn by Ms. Lopez and Shakira, a former client. Despite the modest digs, clients like Ciara, Cara Delevingne, Rachel McAdams and Emily Ratajkowski often drop by to try on clothes.\n\nAt a recent fitting for the backup dancers on Ms. Stefani\u2019s tour, Ms. Haenn, Mr. Zangardi and their in-house tailor, Anna Kenaraki (poached, with blessings, from Ms. Lopez), bopped along to reggaeton and debated the merits of side versus back zippers (back zippers, Ms. Haenn said, are less likely to get stuck during a frantic midconcert costume change). They discussed the sartorial effects of \u201cbum flaps,\u201d rectangles of fabric that frame the hips of Ms. Stefani and her dancers and create the illusion of movement even when they\u2019re not doing much of it. These are conversations Mr. Zangardi and Ms. Haenn like to have.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a red carpet, you\u2019re just doing this,\u201d Ms. Haenn said, strutting two steps and squatting primly. \u201cWith what we do, we need to make sure you\u2019re not going to get stabbed with a huge safety pin while you\u2019re running around on stage.\u201d",

A new study shows that not only did fewer new ventures launch, but those that did were concentrated in major cities, rather than in small towns and rural communities.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014 there was a net of 166,500 new businesses in the U.S., half of which were generated in metropolitan areas like Silicon Valley, Houston, Miami and New York City, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s County Business Patterns program analyzed by the bipartisan Economic Innovation Group.\n\nThat\u2019s only about a 2.3% uptick in net new business growth, much lower than the new businesses opened following the last two financial recessions. In fact, nearly three out of five counties analyzed actually reported more businesses open than closed between 2010 and 2014.\n\nCompare that with the 1990s recovery, which recorded a 6.7% net increase in new businesses, while the 2000s recovery following the dot-com bubble saw a similar increase of 5.6%.\n\nBut not only was the rise in new business generation during this recovery smaller, the concentration of growth in major cities is unusual. During the 1990s recovery, 125 counties were responsible for half of the net total new business establishments in the country. But in the most recent recovery, only 20 counties in dense metropolitan areas generated half of the net new business growth achieved.\n\nThe 1990s recovery also showed the smallest counties added new businesses at the fastest rate. That trend slowed during the 2000s recovery \u2014 and by the most recent recovery period in the 2010s, it reversed. From 2010 to 2014, all counties with fewer than 1 million people averaged far lower business growth rates than the national average, while those with over a million people did better.\n\nThese trends indicate that the knowledge- and technology-driven industries that fuel modern growth have very different needs from the locations in which they are founded than industries that have led growth in the past.",

But she\u2019s not worried about buying diapers.\n\nWelcome plans to deliver her baby at a community hospital instead of a higher-priced Boston teaching hospital. The decision is expected to save thousands of dollars for her employer, which pays most of her health insurance costs. As a reward, the company has promised to buy two years\u2019 worth of diapers and wipes.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it influenced my decision,\u201d said Welcome, 25, who also has a toddler daughter. \u201cThe free diapers is an amazing incentive.\u201d\n\nState data show that the price of maternity care and other medical services can vary by many thousands of dollars from one hospital to another, and that price differences are not tied to quality. A commission has been assembled to study the issue. But some employers are seeking to exploit the price discrepancies, offering cash and other incentives, such as free diapers, to encourage workers to choose lower-cost health care services and providers.\n\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox:\n\nThe Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.\n\nWhen employees choose less expensive options for common services such as lab tests, colonoscopies, MRIs, physical therapy, and maternity care, their employers and health insurers can save hundreds or thousands of dollars per service. Employees may be able to save on their share of medical costs, as well, while pocketing sometimes lucrative rewards.\n\nOver time, if enough people shop around, the lower-cost claims can put a dent in rising health care premiums, employers said.\n\nOver the past few years, many insurers and employers have launched websites that estimate the costs at different providers, to allow consumers to shop around. (Massachusetts insurers are required to put this information online). But the sites are rarely used.\n\nEmployers are realizing they need to provide tangible rewards, said Patty Houpt, executive director of the New England Employee Benefits Council. \u201cIf you provide them with a financial incentive, all of a sudden they will be using that website,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to shop around unless you pay them to do it.\u201d\n\nHoupt and others said that such rewards (carrots) can be more successful than just moving employees into high-deductible or tiered health plans that force them to pay more out of pocket for expensive hospitals (sticks).\n\nWelcome works in customer service at Phia Group, a Braintree consulting firm that helps employers reduce health care costs, often testing new ideas in-house first. CEO Adam V. Russo offered the diaper perk last year to encourage employees to consider lower-cost hospitals.\n\nAt Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort, a ski resort in Hancock, executives are giving $100 to employees who choose lower-cost settings for routine tests, and even some surgeries, such as cataract and tonsil procedures.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, they get $100 back because they\u2019re saving the company money,\u201d resort owner Brian Fairbank said. \u201cAn MRI is an MRI, whether you get it done at the hospital or an imaging center,\u201d he said, though hospitals tend to charge more.\n\nCash rewards work best for employers that carry the insurance risk for their employees and pay claims and set premiums themselves (as opposed to employers that use insurance companies for those tasks). Businesses with cost-saving incentives say they have to spend many hours educating employees about the complexities of health care pricing, so employees are comfortable enough to shop around for care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking them to do something they\u2019ve never done before,\u201d said Rob Graybill, a vice president at Vitals, a New Jersey company that makes Web tools to help consumers shop for care. \u201cThis is a behavior change.\u201d\n\nVitals\u2019s SmartShopper program compiles a list of facilities for routine services. When they pick cost-efficient facilities, patients earn rewards ranging from $25 to $500. For a lab test, total savings could be a couple hundred dollars. For surgery, it could be well over $10,000.\n\nThe savings have added up at organizations like HealthTrust, a Concord, N.H., benefits provider for 47,000 public employees. HealthTrust said it saved almost $1.7 million in the first nine months of this year, even after paying employees $218,000 in rewards.\n\nMany experts say the ability of consumers to shop for some care is important for bringing health care costs under control. If enough people switch to lower-cost providers, the thinking goes, it will reduce spending and put pressure on expensive facilities to lower prices.\n\nBut some worry that price shopping makes it more difficult to coordinate a patient\u2019s care and could disrupt relationships between patients and their doctors.\n\nFor some, the rewards can be significant. Mary Burkhalter, a paralegal at Phia Group who works from home in Louisiana, considered two facilities for weight loss surgery. Though the same doctor would be performing the procedure, the price difference was a hefty $18,000.\n\nBurkhalter, 53, took advantage of another unusual employer perk. When she uses medical facilities that save the company money, she gets a check for up to 20 percent of the savings. She and her husband both had the gastric sleeve procedure. They have been losing weight and feeling healthier \u2014 and they got a reward, after taxes, of $4,300. It comes at a good time: They are preparing for some home renovations and plan to send their son to college next year.",

I've been obsessively checking the impressive \u00c2\u00a329.99 balance in my regular account to see if anything has changed. It has and it hasn't. Actually, that's the only way my mind can realistically relate to all the manic panic of loss adjustment. When I hear on the news that billions have \"disappeared\" around the world, it seems unreal but if one day my balance read \u00c2\u00a329.98, I'd be a mess. Last show had us taking a carnal carousing aboard the cathartic express. David Baddiel was this week's visiting volunteer who soon found himself immersed within the verbal hot tub. It was good to meet Ricky from the Pride of Britain awards and I'm glad to see that he's turned his tragedy around to go on and inspire others. I guess such life-or-death stories truly put the current fiscal losses into perspective. I still worry about that missing penny though.\n\nThe Karmic Cuddle of Kindness Is the Bank balance half-full or half empty? Event combination unlocks the stock of Baddiel-suited gentry, Dollars down, depressed Euros and Pounds, And yet a comedic cornucopia can now be found, Bill's chameleon's molested, Madeley came corrected, But there's Good MILF Hunting from the horn of the plenty, Married to the game, Intoxicated with the fame, Even chocolate's concocted so that reindeers can be tamed, Ricky turned the tragedy of reality to offset the insanity of vanity, But the Blighty-pipe layer still desired a Shag-bo calamity!\n\nUPDATE: Oct 29th. This evening as you probably know Russell resigned from his Radio 2 show. If you've arrived at this blog wanting to comment or respond to Russell's recent show with Jonathan Ross then you can comment on the Have Your Say site on BBC News. Currently it is very busy so please bear with us. Alternatively The BBC's formal complaints site is here and there are many places to discuss this news story away from the BBC . In the meantime we are closing comments throughout this blog. Thanks. Jem Stone Communities Executive, BBC Audio and Music.\n\nDay 22: still no sign of Captain Morgan. Noel stepped in to take the hot seat, while he's resting his ribs (moaning that the pain was taking all the fun out of the painkillers). But he was in fine form, still trying to set up his patented \"Noel Gallagher pet-naming service\" to capitalise on his unique \"gift\" for naming animals. To test his prowess, I once showed him a picture of a ladybird which he duly christened \"Spot\" and another of a wild boar who he left saddled with the name \"Boss\".....hmmm. Still Noel seemed happy enough with his requested rider of soft porn and pot noodle (ahhh... every man's basic needs satisfied). Russell's basic needs have always seemed to be a bit more far reaching: resolving the revolution, reconnecting to a higher form of reasoning and retaking his A-levels in a bubbling hot-tub. It would be interesting to see them both in a sitcom though, especially any episode where Noel tries to rename Morrisey!\n\nExcuse the Jacuzzi Every path that claims to be eternal is in reality a circle, To the distressed damsels across the land, A little hot-tub won't hurt you, Check the X-files of naming pet crimes, The truth is out there, so expect lies, If we reject styles based on sex and crimes, We'd have less razzle and more noodle to infect minds, Farms of fussed pots, Sarah and Katie's love lost, Amidst the chapsticks and cracked ribs, For every slapstick, there awaits a cross, Beyond the collapsing dollars and pounds, The back of the cab's still gaining ground, But where there's a will, there's a wheel, and sometimes a goose or penguin to be found!\n\nIt appears that in the aftermath of the VMA fallout there seemed to be several heavy subjects weighing on Russell's mind. Was it the M.I.A. status of fellow co-conspirator Matt Morgan? Was it the injuries sustained by ground soldier Noel in the line of fire? Or was it the inspired hope and dream that some day we'll all rise above our respective differences and unite as one people, one aim, one destiny. All to the sound of \"Chugga Chugga?\" Good to see Simon Amstell again, he's a blast from the past from the old days of Russell's \"small weird gigs\" which would normally end in utter mayhem (not much has changed there I guess!). This time the \"gig\" took us through a discussion on prejudice, freedom of speech and the twin peaked occupants of a wonderbra (not much has changed there either). It also gave Dita Von Tease a chance to experience the Brand banter in full flow and interestingly enough, she didn't really seem to mind all the Buzzcocks! Freedom on a Half-Shell Freedom of speech decrees all one and each, Shouldn't wish for permission to be given to reach, If it's forgiveness you seek, Or a collision to reap, Then test the waters, test the lands, test the valleys and peaks, To reclusively speak on the revolution elite, Pop the bubble, free the grasshoppers, Break the wind that's released, The Waterman believes for \"Chugga Chugga\" to peak, That's what virgins on the conspicuous conditionally seek, Different techniques compete for bisexual critique, Let's add race to this \"Jolly Box\" and a Grange Hill plot is complete, From Dita Von Tease to Simon Amstell, Russell's teeth chatter to greet them, I guess such a release of speech exposes the true cleavage of freedom!\n\nAfter over 190 shows of bright lights, live mics and fighting daily stage fright, \"West End Gee\" has finally left the building. Yes, \"Into the Hoods\" has been the first Hip Hop production to ever reach the West End and broke the record for being the longest running Dance show there (previously held by Swan Lake). It's truly been an amazing experience for me and despite Russell's tireless fishing for any sordid gossip, the bait was never taken (smile). It was a bit of a strange show with both Alex James's and Noel Gallagher's phones being on the blink. I guess that the old Blur vs Oasis rivalry even extends into the realm of mobile network reception. Next week, it'll be the countdown to the Video Music Awards..... hmmmm do you think perhaps we can expect Morrisey's name to surface somewhere amongst the nominees? The Fired House With the final octave that rocked it, Rings for Roses, test optics, Faceless voices expose choices, With God's endorsements of shocked bits, The good Doctor's space-hopped it, With a Lord Viking or Hobbit, Befriending a Branson with the plan to fly cheap super-sonic, Air bag the vomit, Alex James \"flute-winking\" symphonic, Bellowing to Cellos in devil-throes of broom handle colonic, Adorning Laura with an award for her Fraggle Rock scoring, Wet-tailing the genitalia until the VMAs are calling!\n\nYou know, sometimes I actually feel a litlle bit sorry for Noel Gallagher. I mean here's a guy who's penned some classic anthems in his time, toured around the world, been many places and ruffled many faces. Yet amidst all this, he still comes down on to our little show and partake in his regular chats with Russell. These, like most exchanges, generally descend into the trading of insults but it's all in the name of fun. This time however, he brought his missus Sarah to see the show in action and watch the madness unfold. Now there's an unwritten code amongst men that when one of your friends is with his girl, you usually lighten up on the jokes (just a touch). Unfortunately, Russell decided to write this unwritten rule on the back of his black toilet paper using a black biro in the dark. Hence the Noel-baiting banter flew as thick and as fast as ever... ah yeah... business as usual. Happy Birthday and thanks to Gareth for maintaining the rhyme with a \"g\". The Colour of Money Starting instead with a signal that's red, Changing from amber to green, Let's examine the scene: The T-shirt is free, The dishwasher's salty, Taking a \"slash\" in the back, Wandering what a Top Hat will reveal, The Horne has lost all his zeal, Drawing upon a currency, That fuels the fire of desire for Noel's bookclub appeal, This Kalidescope sees Sarah bringing toilet-Elvis back from the dead, As he changes from red to amber to green, Green to amber to red.\n\nDeep within a secluded lagoon of pre-recorded time, there awaited an intrepid vessel preparing to be launched into the continuum. 1st mate Matt had diligently applied his \"mane and tail\" shampoo and was ever ready for any foreseeable event. Captain Brand had meanwhile opted for the full body defence option to protect him on this mission. He sported the much coveted \"Boyce Behaviour Armour\" (circa 1984), which was considered to be most formidable. The ship set sail through the magical \"Rainbow of Georges\" (where the legendary Boris Dancers dwell) and made its way up the \"Westwood River\". But before it could reach \"Hatton island\" a mighty crash occurred and a huge fog descended. Amidst the mahyem could be heard the oh-so-familiar cackle of the pirate Captain Ross and his first mate Pudsey (boooooo). \"Where's Bwand?\" he shouted. A gruelling battle ensued as the mighty titans clashed. There were black toilet rolls and Ferrari keys flying all over the shop. Pudsey was the victim of an extreme cuddle and left weeping in the corner (to be later consoled by Matt) and the poet Gee was thrown overboard to drown in an unforgiving sea of metaphors and similies. Finally, the mist cleared and all that was left was a solitary Rainbow George who prayed for all our souls. Amen. This week: I celebrated my birthday by going to see my favourite MC Ice Cube do his first UK show in a decade..... Awesome! The Grand Pianist Like the echoes of a piano's final notes of symphony, Attracting those who're in the throes of a black bog roll epiphany, So cry Matt a river, He'll get aroused just like Trigger, Will Sweep awake from his sleep, When a Rainbow George speech is delivered, Our Souls face an alien attack, Tinkling the ivories with Boyce, As Ross sees sharp to be flat, And love is in the air as Westwood reacts, If a kiss is just a kiss, Just ask Ricky and Frank!\n\nCaptain's log: star date 2008.\n\nIt's been another traumatic day for the good citizens of Brand Enterprises as we are all adjusting to this newly imposed regime of niceness. Since his return, Russell has been extraordinarily nice to each and every member of the crew. No tantrums, no bickering, no sackings, no screaming.\n\nThere's been some gruelling team-building exercises: line dancing, mandatory smiling and heel clicking seminars have been provided for and now we all have to sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" at the end of each day.\n\nJokes aside, it was good to celebrate Babs's (Russell's mum) birthday, see Noel showing love to Jay-Z and have Miss Sierra Leone come in to raise awareness for the Great Ormond St Hospital charity.\n\nAnyway I must dash. I've got a \"tree hugging\" tutorial to attend to!\n\nAs light prevails amongst the shadows,\n\nShadows will still evade the light,\n\nSound is crafted through the silence,\n\nForming laughs for your delights,\n\nPurple pill popping until the morning comes,\n\nA finger of \"fun\" is just enough,\n\nUntil the Team-building drawings done,\n\nNoel and Lionel are cavorting chums,\n\nRemembering Henry as \"The Fonz\"\n\nA tale of two Stephens,\n\nThe roots of the truth behind actual events of freedom,\n\nMamusu gives us something to believe in,\n\nSo let me just say \"Happy Birthday\" to Babs,\n\nTo see her lil' face beaming!",

        "text": "She's surrounded by hot bodies and party girls, a bunch of surfers soaking in the sun in the waning minutes of a Jacksonville Jaguars game. She knows most of them, smiling behind her shades as they show skin and affection the way so many beachgoers do. To a stranger, she seems just like one of them -- another young American with too much time spent on a tan and too little time spent at work. And in a way, she is like them -- she was a pro surfer too, hanging ten for sport and hanging out for a living. But in another way, Kristin Wilson is completely different from all the other surfers. She is an entrepreneur, a business woman, a money-making author of her very own American dream. And what's funny is, her American dream has nothing to do with surfing. It doesn't even take place in America.\n\nWe go from sun-drenched Jacksonville a few Sundays ago to a dark room in Las Vegas a few months ago, where a few college-age men sat stone-faced at their computers. This is a scene that used to take place everywhere in America, every day -- young men (and some women) playing online poker. For many, it was a hobby. For some, a growing addiction. For these guys, from North Carolina State University, it was a job. And then, on April 15 of this year, the unthinkable took place.\n\nThePostGame brings you the most interesting sports stories on the web. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter to read them first!\n\n\"I was actually playing when it happened,\" says Nick Hatley. \"The Department of Justice had seized the websites.\"\n\nThe FBI had shut down three of the biggest online poker sites, alleging the owners had laundered money and defrauded banks to skirt gambling laws. Poker players are nothing if not resourceful, so Hatley and his friends started looking at other sites. Surely there was a way around this.\n\n\"When PokerStars stopped letting players open new tables,\" Hatley says, \"I knew there was a serious problem.\"\n\nPanic set in. This wasn't just a temporary power outage; some players had hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in the coffers of these companies. Poker agent Brian Balsbaugh later told CNBC's Darren Rovell, \"It happened, it happened fast and it completely annihilated what was a flourishing industry in the United States.\"\n\nIt came to be called Black Friday. And suddenly thousands of online poker players had to choose their country or their main source of income.\n\nHatley left for Canada in May, but immigration rules forbid staying for more than six months out of a particular year. So he was stuck.\n\n\"Then,\" he says, \"we found Kristin.\"\n\nKristin Wilson is the last person you'd think could be a poker pied piper. She has never played. She doesn't even own a deck of cards. And beyond that, surfing seems about the least appropriate sport to prepare for a career in poker. Surfers are up before dawn, eating perfectly, soaking up the rays and allowing the rhythm of the waves to wash all stresses away. Online poker players are up all night, eating whatever, staring at their screens until the adrenaline withers their nerves away.\n\nBut Wilson, 29, never really fit in perfectly with surfers either. She was a cheerleader who had an interest in quantum physics. She studied and surfed in Costa Rica before graduating from the University of Central Florida in 2004, and got her MBA in '05. Surfing was something she was good at -- something she actually moved back to Costa Rica to do after getting her business degree -- but she didn't want to do it forever.\n\nHer true calling happened almost randomly. She met several people in Costa Rica who worked in sports books, which are huge there. She kept in touch. And on April 15 of this year, she read countless cries of desperation on her Twitter and Facebook feeds. Several mentioned the idea of going to Costa Rica. She knew the terrain. She spoke Spanish. She could help.\n\n\"So I just started emailing people,\" she says. \"I figured I should just do this as a business. Not many people were equipped to just pick up and move to a different country.\"\n\nThat was for sure. The hurdle for the poker players to relocate to Costa Rica wasn't money. They had plenty. It was logistics. And effort.\n\n\"Poker players by nature are very lazy,\" says Hatley. \"Most people like me, they just sit in the house and play poker all day. They don't understand how to deal with life issues.\"\n\nWilson knew the type -- let's face it, surfers aren\u2019t exactly detail-oriented either -- and she figured she could do a lot more than find these guys a place to live. How were they going to set up a bank account? How were they going to get around safely? How were they going to install a T-1 line, for that matter?\n\nSo for $1,000 a person, Wilson did pretty much everything for the transplants. She found them houses, she had them fetched at the airport, she walked them through immersion in the day-to-day culture. She even defended them to skeptical landlords who didn't want night owls as tenants. One of her clients, an online poker forum called PocketFives.com, suggested they join forces. Kristin got her own page, calling it \"Poker Refugees.\"\n\nAnd now it's a strange, platonic marriage between the refugees and the sunny blonde. \"I'm their friend,\" Wilson says. \"They call when they're having a bad day. They tell me what hand they got. They copy and paste it into an email and send.\"\n\nThat's the least of her self-appointed duties. She finds the exiles maid service, groceries, even places to go to find a date. She wakes up at 4:45 a.m., works out, reaches out to the next group of refugees on the way from Vegas or Canada, meets with prospective clients, and then helps whomever needs it for the rest of the afternoon and evening. She answers questions on the Poker Refugees website -- even one from a New Yorker in Denmark who has no foreign bank account but wants to play anyway. \"I can still help you,\" she chirps.\n\nWilson no longer surfs, has no boyfriend, and doesn't see much of her roommate in her three-bedroom condo. Her trip home to North Florida was merely to see her folks, see some friends, and get her car fixed. \"If I'm ever not working,\" she says,\" I feel guilty.\" She's not lonely or miserable, though -- not hardly. She's just an entrepreneur running her own start-up. She loves the challenge and the intimacy of it. In real estate, you're just an agent. In this kind of thing, you matter.\n\n\"It would be impossible without Kristin,\" says poker refugee Mazin Khoury. \"If you spoke Spanish, you'd have a better chance. But we don't.\"\n\nIf you think this little enterprise is somehow un-American -- a Florida girl getting paid to help gamblers go off-shore to make a mint -- consider that the poker exiles pay tens of thousands of dollars in taxes to the U.S. government. They wouldn't be paying anywhere near as much if they lived at home. Wilson is hardly patting herself on the back, but when you add up dozens of poker players each making tens or hundreds of thousands, her service is funneling the U.S. government a rather large amount of money. \"I still pay taxes,\" she says. \"We're all contributing members of society. We're not complaining or living off the government.\"\n\nAnd that's why pretty much everyone thinks this situation won't last. There are too many millions -- even billions -- at stake. \"I'm still sticking to the notion in my head we'll have poker back,\" says Khoury. \"There's too much money to be made by these companies and the U.S. government. It just seems like how can something not get done when it's a billion dollar industry.\"\n\nKristin's fine with that. She says when that time comes, she'll just move on to something else. That's the surfer in her -- ride every wave until the end and don't look back. For now, she'll be up late at night, taking calls from her new clients, trying to empathize with a bad deal or a bad hand.\n\n\"What am I supposed to say?\" she jokes. \"I just tell them they'll get it back.\"\n\nHearing that makes the poker refugees feel better. Because, after all, Kristin's already gotten it back for them.\n\nPopular Stories On ThePostGame: -- Tilted World: The Broken Faith In Online Poker -- Video: Flare Surfing Is Both The Coolest And The Hottest Thing On Water -- MLB Veteran Survives Near-Fatal Surfing Injury",

Not so fast, says Lord Paul Drayson.\n\nOn 15 October, the British peer and racing driver set a slew of speed records behind the wheel of his Lola Drayson electric prototype racer, including a run of 205.139mph (333.271kph). That speed represents the average of a pair of one-mile passes on a closed runway at Elvington Airfield in Yorkshire, England. (According to racing\u2019s governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile, speed records must be recorded by runs in opposite directions within an hour of each other to offset the effects of sloped terrain or wind.)

The 53-year-old Labour Party member also set an EV record for the standing-start quarter-mile, recording a time of 9.742 seconds.\n\nAnd for good measure, in addition to his impending world records Drayson chalked up a British flying-mile speed record for a wheel-driven vehicle powered by any kind of engine (as opposed to jet- and rocket-engined cars that don\u2019t power their wheels).\n\nThe Drayson racer\u2019s electric motor produces a maximum of 640kW of power (that\u2019s about 850hp), which is more than double that of the highest-performance version of the speedy Tesla Model S road car.

        "text": "A Norman Rockwell painting titled Saying Grace sold Wednesday at a New York City auction for $46m, the highest price ever paid at auction for an American painting, Sotheby's said.\n\nThe painting had a pre-sale estimate of $15-20m. The $46m price includes a premium. The buyer wasn't disclosed. In 2006, the same auction house sold Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties for more than $15m, then a record. Another Rockwell painting, The Gossips, sold Wednesday for just under $8.5m, while a third, Walking to Church, fetched a little more than $3.2m.\n\nFor nearly two decades, all three had been on loan at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which has the world's largest collection of original Rockwell art, and is located in the artist's hometown.\n\nRockwell was paid $3,500 for Saying Grace. It appeared on the cover of the magazine's Thanksgiving issue in 1951 and was voted Post readers' favorite cover in a 1955 poll. The idea for the illustration came from a reader who saw a Mennonite family praying in a restaurant. Rockwell's son, Jarvis, was among the models the artist used for the drawing.\n\nThe illustrator, who created his first cover for the Post in 1916, is celebrated for his reflections of small town America and portraits of famous figures. Rockwell spent 47 years at the magazine and produced 321 covers. He died in 1978.\n\nThe Gossips, which was a cover illustration for the 6 March, 1948, issue, depicts a montage of the artist's neighbors, wife Mary and Rockwell himself finger-wagging and yammering on the phone. Walking to Church appeared on the cover of the 4 April, 1953, issue and shows a family dressed in their Sunday best walking along a city street. Rockwell based it on a painting by Johann Vermeer.\n\nThe trio, along with four other Rockwell works, were being sold by the family of Kenneth Stuart, Rockwell's longtime art director at the magazine. The sale comes years after a legal fight among Stuart's three sons. Rockwell and Stuart worked together at the magazine for 18 years.\n\nLaurie Norton Moffatt, director at the Rockwell museum, has expressed hope that the three Rockwells will eventually be returned. \"We cared for them like children \u2026 We hope they come back some day. We believe that's where they belong,\" she said.",

In the event, neither turned out to be much of an issue.\n\n\"I find it interesting and good how the British deal with foreigners who do well,\" he says. \"I became 'London-based, German-born artist Tillmans'. In Germany you'd always be an Italian artist, a Spanish artist or whatever.\" He was, however, appalled at a Daily Telegraph headline: Gay Porn Photographer Snaps Up Turner - \"I was really upset about that level of stupidity.\"\n\nHe calls the Turner prize \"in its heyday the biggest single exposure an artist could have on this planet\". He loved preparing his installation for the show - photographs, taped to the walls or hung on bulldog clips, with vitrines with more images in the centre of the room. \"I enjoyed the late-night access to the Tate, working in the quiet and cycling home late past parliament.\"\n\nThat year there was a \"solidarity\" among the shortlisted artists - who included Tomoko Takahashi, Glenn Brown and Michael Raedecker. \"We were very easy about the process - none of us was hyperfuelled in a competitive way.\"\n\nOn the day itself, he says, \"I felt as if I was waiting for my own execution to happen. It was like holding on for an exam result or something - the feeling that in 10 hours something enormous is going to happen, whatever the outcome is.\" By the time he made it to the post-award celebrations - described by Jake Chapman as \"something midway between a school disco and an office party\" - it was \"so crowded I couldn't get in.

        "text": "TAMPA \u2014 Michelle Baker and her husband Greg are the kind of people you\u2019re magnetically drawn to because you feel cool-by-association in their presence. He\u2019s the low-key, inked-up, James Beard-nominated chef behind two of Tampa\u2019s smartest restaurants. She\u2019s over 6 feet tall, tells cheeky stories, and dyes her hair the color of blanched almonds.\n\nChatting on their porch under the watchful blue eyes of their cat Handsome Dick Manitoba (named after the lead singer of the punk band the Dictators), the culinary trailblazers seemed a bit hesitant at first to take credit for Tampa\u2019s burgeoning restaurant scene. After some prodding and cajoling, they finally relented.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be cocky and finally embrace it,\u201d Greg Baker said. \u201cWe changed the restaurant game in Tampa.\u201d\n\nAn Asian take on barbeque chicken from Ichicoro Ramen.\n\nHe\u2019s not just strumming his own ukulele. The Bakers\u2019 pioneering gumption helped transform their once-blighted neighborhood into a nascent foodie destination. They laid a foundation for the new gastro scene.\n\nWhen they opened their first restaurant, the Refinery, in 2010 there was nothing like it in Tampa. The menu changes multiple times a week based on the local harvest. For a city that is the corporate home of chains such as Outback Steakhouse, Fleming\u2019s Prime Steakhouse, and Checkers Drive-In, the Refinery\u2019s farm-to-fork mindset was revolutionary.\n\nThis town-within-a-town makeover \u2013 along the once-forgotten strip of Collins Avenue \u2013 is the vision of one man.\n\nWith this formula, Greg Baker not only lit a fire under his Yard Bird en Cocotte, but he also lit an inspirational fire under many of the city\u2019s chefs.\n\nI need to stop here and reiterate that this James Beard-nominated chef endearingly refers to the chicken on his menu as yard bird.\n\nThanks to the Bakers and their ilk, the neighborhood of Seminole Heights, a part of Tampa once known for its ruffians, strumpets, and non-stop transgressions, has become the epicenter of a movement that\u2019s spread across the city. On a characterless boulevard full of used car dealerships and empty sidewalks there are now restaurants where people wait for tables on Friday and Saturday nights \u2014 sometimes up to three and four hours.\n\nIt\u2019s changed so much that Michelle Baker wants to celebrate her neighborhood on a T-shirt.\n\n\u201cIt would say \u2018Seminole Heights\u2019 on the front,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the back would read: \u2018It\u2019s not just hookers and drug dealers.\u2019\u201d\n\nBefore we get ahead of ourselves, the Seminole Heights neighborhood is not exactly the new Brooklyn. You\u2019ll hear the comparison from everyone, but please disregard. Also, good food is not a foreign concept in Tampa. It is the somewhat disputed birthplace of the Cuban sandwich and the home of the legendary and opulent Bern\u2019s Steak House and its spin-off Haven. Bern\u2019s is so legendary that its owners recently partnered with a hotel group to open Epicurean Hotel, an innovative food-themed hotel in the Hyde Park neighborhood.\n\nLondon-born mixologist Ro Patel recalls his first stroll through the city shortly after moving to Tampa eight years ago.\n\n\u201cI remember going downtown at 8 or 9 at night to check it out, and it was tumble weeds,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere was nothing going on. All the bars and businesses were closed and I thought, \u2018Oh my God, what have I done? Why did I move here?\u2019\u201d\n\nThree years later, Patel, a well-regarded cocktail master, changed the city\u2019s bar culture by opening a speakeasy called Ciro\u2019s. He said residents were slow to warm up to his menu of classic cocktails, but now reservations (and a password) are necessary to gain entry. Downtown Tampa, which is a short drive from Seminole Heights, is experiencing a renaissance of its own thanks in part to the newly completed Riverwalk\n\n\u201cThe transformation of the restaurant scene here is happening at breakneck speed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Seminole Heights has been perfect because the rent there was conducive to young chefs opening up restaurants.\u201d\n\nTy Rodriguez (left) and Ferrell Alvarez are among young chefs and restauranteurs who have transformed the Seminole Heights neighborhood in Tampa.\n\nTwo of those young restaurateurs, Ty Rodriguez and Ferrell Alvarez, saw just how starved (bad pun intended) Tampa residents were for new dining options when they opened their restaurant Rooster & the Till at the end of 2013. They started with 35 seats, grew to 42 seats in March 2014, and this July doubled their space. The walls are paneled in horizontal slabs of recovered wood and finished off with a picture of a giant rooster from the Ybor neighborhood.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night the place was packed. Alvarez darted around the open kitchen while I stuffed myself with a small plate of gnocchi, short ribs, smoked ricotta, and spicy pickled peperonata. It may sound like a lot for one dish, but Alverez is a master of playing with flavors without excessive portions. Look no further than the artistry of his matcha custard, miso butterscotch, black sesame nori \u201cglass,\u201d with valrhona chocolate five spice sorbet. It resembles modern art on a small plate.\n\nTampanians \u2014 or Tampans, take your pick \u2014 who previously steered clear of Seminole Heights, are now starting to approach the neighborhood, but cautiously.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tons of funny stories about that,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cI hear people say \u2018I hope my car is safe out there.\u2019 There was a group that got back to their car, and they saw that their hubcaps weren\u2019t stolen and said \u2018I get to keep my hubcaps and this place is awesome, I\u2019m definitely coming back.\u2019 It\u2019s pretty hilarious.\u201d\n\nMany of these young chefs moved away from Tampa, but returned to be near their families. Noel Cruz, co-owner of the insanely popular Ichicoro Ramen grew up in Tampa and came back after opening two restaurants in New York. He and chef Masaru Takaku opened Ichicoro Ramen in a former autobody shop. The two put an innovative Asian spin on favorites such as the Cuban sandwich and fried chicken.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on here,\u201d said Takaku, looking a bit frazzled after the Saturday lunch crush. \u201cWe saw an opportunity, and the timing was perfect.\u201d\n\nMasaru Takaku, chef of Ichicoro Ramen.\n\nSo perfect that patrons wait up to four hours for tables. I didn\u2019t have that kind of time or patience, so I came for a very late lunch and dug into the CuBaoNo bun. I had spent most of the day eating, but it didn\u2019t stop me from trying some of the favorites at Ichicoro, or the Independent Bar and Cafe, the Mermaid Tavern, Fodder & Shine (also owned by the Bakers), and Ella\u2019s Americana Folk Art Cafe, which technically isn\u2019t in Seminole Heights, but close enough for me to visit for the funky monkey waffle. I confess that I stepped into Tampa\u2019s buzzy gastro scene with a skeptical attitude, low expectations, and a raised eyebrow. I left with a much snugger waistband on my jeans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a safe restaurant scene,\u201d said Alvarez of Rooster & the Till. \u201cBut that\u2019s why people are coming to this neighborhood. The restaurants aren\u2019t cookie cutter. People have this misconception that Tampa is mundane. I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s quickly changing.\u201d",

        "text": "Some companies embrace change. Some get suffocated in change\u2019s embrace. And shares of International Business Machines (IBM) have performed dismally in recent years because investors have no idea which of those categories it belongs to.\n\nIBM ibm , the Armonk, N.Y., tech giant that turned 105 years old this week, has been stuck at a junction since before Ginni Rometty took the helm as CEO in 2012. The older computing technology on which the company and its white-button-down, black-tie consultants built their dominance in the 20th century, such as servers and mainframes, has crept toward obsolescence. IBM knows that its future lies in cloud technology and artificial intelligence\u2014and Rometty steadfastly preaches that gospel. But the old tech is declining faster than the new tech is growing. Revenue has fallen for 16 consecutive quarters, to $81.7 billion in 2015, and since its March 2013 peak, IBM\u2019s stock is down 30%, trailing the S&P 500 by a mercy-rule-\u00adinvoking 62 percentage points. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when that will end,\u201d \u00adlaments Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz.\n\nThe advent of cloud computing, which enables corporations to store and manage their data without investing in their own costly infrastructure, changed everything for IBM. The cloud slashed demand for both its servers and the highly profitable consulting and support services that IBM paired with them.\n\nIBM is competing in the cloud, which accounted for $10.8 billion, or 13% of its overall revenue over the past year. But the company has thrown much of its effort behind so-called hybrid cloud services that incorporate private servers, allowing the company to continue providing \u201cmiddleware\u201d and support to clients. Middleware accounts for about 40% of IBM\u2019s profits, according to Moskowitz. But that business model puts the company at a disadvantage against competitors like Amazon amzn and Microsoft msft that emphasize less expensive \u201cpublic cloud\u201d services. \u201cYou don\u2019t get fired for going with Amazon Web Services,\u201d UBS analyst Steven Milunovich says that company CIOs have told him. \u201cIt\u2019s the new IBM.\u201d\n\nWith IBM well below 10% in cloud market share by most estimates, few investors think that business will help the company turn its fortunes around. Bulls are placing their bets instead on IBM\u2019s machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) efforts\u2014represented in the public eye by Watson, the glib-toned box showcased on Jeopardy! and innumerable commercials.\n\nMorgan Stanley ms analyst Katy Huberty, who earlier this year upgraded her recommendation on IBM from the equivalent of neutral to buy, considers IBM a front-runner in the AI race, since Watson\u2019s analytical capabilities have potential applications in fields ranging from travel to finance to retail. Huberty says she\u2019s encouraged by IBM\u2019s recent push to acquire a monster trove of AI-oriented data\u2014\u00adespecially in the health care sector, where IBM Watson Health bought Truven Health Analytics in February for $2.6 billion.\n\nIBM doesn\u2019t break out figures for its AI work\u2014a sore point among investors who are looking for clearer data, says Moskowitz. But analysts say that IBM\u2019s \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d business, which includes AI efforts as well as cloud, security, and other initiatives, will surpass 50% of revenues by mid-2017. The business accounted for $28.9 billion in sales in 2015, up 17% from 2014. While there\u2019s plenty of competition in this realm too\u2014Google googl and Microsoft have their own AI \u00adambitions\u2014Huberty believes that if IBM manages even a 25% market share, AI will be \u201ceasily a $50 billion business\u201d for the company.\n\nFor more on IBM, watch this Fortune video:\n\nThat, of course, is a big if, and one many investors aren\u2019t willing to bet on. Only seven of 26 analysts who follow the company rate it a buy or strong buy\u2014an unusually low ratio in that bullish community. Institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds have also fled, accounting for only 66% of IBM shares, according to Morningstar; for comparable tech giants like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Cisco Systems csco , that figure is 82% or more. But if IBM does finally reverse its revenue declines, those institutions could pile back into the stock\u2014generating a nice pop for people willing to invest in it now. (\u201cAnother reason not to be super bearish,\u201d notes Milunovich.)\n\nInvestors who take that gamble would be buying a still-profitable company for a very low 11 times 2017 earnings, and collecting a 3.4% dividend (far above the S&P 500\u2019s average) while they waited. They would be waiting in prestigious company. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway brk.a , IBM\u2019s single largest shareholder, has bought more than 12 million shares since the end of 2013, giving it a total of 81 million. Buffett bought nearly 200,000 in the quarter that ended in March.\n\nOf course, Buffett has also admitted that he may be wrong. The takeaway: Don\u2019t bet money on IBM that you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nA version of this article appears in the July 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cPondering the Puzzle of IBM.\u201d",

It\u2019s not just fun and games: the installation aims to test future ways it will sell its wares to customers.\n\nShoppers at Wonderland, as Target calls the installation, can get their picture superimposed on a giant Etch-A-Sketch, watch their children play in a ball pit next to gigantic replica of the Lego pirate ship, and pose for a selfie with Target\u2019s Bullseye terrier mascot, among other diversions. More importantly for Target, they can also spend money and give insights into how their shopping behavior is changing.\n\nWhen visitors, or as Target calls them, \u201cguests,\u201d enter Wonderland, they get a target sign to wear around the neck that includes an RFID (radio frequency identification) tag, allowing them to make purchases. As visitors pass various displays and see something they want, they can scan the code on the product. Later, once they are ready to exit, they check out and pay for those items, without having had to haul them around. At the end is a chimney through which Santa\u2019s arsm hands off their packages.\n\nTarget\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer, Jeff Jones, told Fortune that Wonderland is what he imagines Willy Wonka, Dr. Seuss and Santa Claus would come up with if asked to create a Christmas store.\n\nBut more seriously, Jones recognizes that Target can\u2019t set up such lavish installations at 1,800 stores, which would be expensive and that anyway people aren\u2019t interested in \u201cspectacle\u201d when buying staples like diapers and underwear.The idea of offering more in-store experience for special merchandising and making it easy for customers to shop without being bogged down by carts is part of what Target is testing in a bid to offer a differentiated shopping experience.\n\nAs Fortune reported in September, Target is currently testing new shopping concepts and next generation in-store experiences, which include the use of robots.\n\nWonderland is hardly the first time Target uses New York City as its muse. The retailer has a long tradition of tapping Gotham\u2019s hipness to spur its own, ranging from having models scale Rockefeller Center in 2005 for a fashion show, to building a life-size dollhouse in Grand Central Station, to having a Christmas pop up store on a boat (USS Target) moored in the Hudson River a few years ago. Wonderland opens on Wednesday through December 22nd.",

        "text": "Memo to art museums: If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it.\n\nIf you are the Museum of Fine Arts, for example, and you have one of the world\u2019s most important collections of paintings by Claude Monet, not to mention enough great things by Monet\u2019s fellow Impressionists and Post-Impressionists to make your great aunt collapse in a wheezing heap, don\u2019t display only what you can squeeze into a single gallery \u2014 as the MFA has done for too long \u2014 and then use limited space as an excuse to rent out the rest.\n\nIn the first in a series of carefully planned moves by MFA director Matthew Teitelbaum, a handful of galleries have been rearranged and rehung. Four involve European art; a fifth (which I plan to write about separately) is devoted to Song Dynasty art from China. Already, the museum seems rejuvenated.\n\nTo give an idea of the depth of the MFA\u2019s Monet holdings: I arrived in Boston in 2008 only to discover that the museum had just sent no fewer than 29 Monet paintings to my hometown, Sydney. What are the chances? I thought. Too bad. And yet \u2014 incredibly \u2014 when I showed up at the MFA, there was still a long wall displaying enough great paintings by Monet to make it the envy of most museums.\n\nWhat a smart move it is, then, to clear out the large, second-floor gallery crammed with a mish-mash of clashing pictures, sculpture, and decorative arts from all over the map and fill it with nothing but paintings by Monet.\n\nMonet is so well loved for a reason. He showed us the world as a person who had just opened her eyes might see it. Things in his pictures do not yet have names. They have not yet been sorted and classified. The substances they describe remain, like paint itself, promiscuous, indivisible, interconnected.\n\nMonet was the great visual poet of transience. He was fascinated by the moment just before an image coalesces and also by the moment just after, when your head moves, a cloud passes over, and the view falls apart.\n\nEven as his separate brush strokes seem to pull the visible world together, they also teeter on the verge of disintegration. When people get up close to his pictures and then move farther away, they are in a sense reenacting this temporal dynamic.\n\nThe range of the MFA\u2019s Monet paintings dazzles. There are pictures from the 1870s of meadows, ships in a harbor, the artist\u2019s wife in a flowering garden, and (most memorably) in a Japanese kimono. The level of ambition \u2014 and genuine originality \u2014 is ramped up in the 1880s and \u201990s, when he began painting cathedral facades, views of the Seine, and haystacks in different atmospheric conditions. By the first decade of the 20th century, as he painted the Japanese bridge and the water lilies in his garden at Giverny, he had entered a kind of dream of art promiscuously interwoven with life.\n\nIt\u2019s all here, in one gallery, and it\u2019s an unforgettable experience.\n\nPaintings hung in the adjacent long gallery connect the dots \u2014 or really, I suppose, the daubs \u2014 between Monet and his closest Impressionist collaborators (Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, and Pierre Renoir) and the Pointillists, who tried to give systematic structure to the experience of color as emancipated by Monet.\n\nThere are no masterpieces here, but in many ways that is to the good. Impressionism was not, finally, a masterpiece kind of movement. Pissarro, Renoir, and Sisley were bent instead on conveying a kind of freshness-in-modesty. So we see a peasant trudging through snow in morning sunlight (Pissarro); rocky crags in Provence (Renoir); and the persistent brightness of snow on a shadowy side of a road (Sisley).\n\nDavid L Ryan/ Globe Staff\n\nThe Sidney and Esther Rabb Gallery.\n\nAt first, Cezanne (who was Pissarro\u2019s friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9) and the young Gauguin addressed their subjects in similar ways. Both are represented here by quiet paintings of country roads, clumps of trees, and houses. But for these two, as for the Pointillists, this kind of pictorial modesty was ultimately insufficient.\n\nWith the Monets displaced from the original gallery for Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, there is room now to display more works by, among others, Gauguin. His \u201cWhere Do We Come From? Who Are We? Where Are We Going?\u201d \u2014 perhaps the most valuable painting in the whole museum \u2014 is back where it belongs, and should be left there in peace now for as long as possible.\n\nThe re-jigged hang in this gallery also boasts two wonderful pairings of portraits, one pair by Van Gogh (Augustine Roulin and her husband Joseph, the postman), the other by Cezanne (the painter himself and his wife). And Degas\u2019s \u201cLittle Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer\u201d is still there at the center of things, tempting you away from the rural strain of French avant-garde art toward the urban, interior, psychological mode of Degas and Gustave Caillebotte. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to put one of the museum\u2019s several Manets in this company, but we will evidently have to wait for that.\n\nIt\u2019s especially good to see the MFA\u2019s great early Edvard Munch in this gallery after years of aimless wandering. Munch combined flat color and curving, stylized forms in ways that chime well with Gauguin. He and Van Gogh were the two great proto-Expressionists, so his inclusion makes great sense.\n\nTwentieth-century expressionism is the theme that unifies a gallery downstairs that used to hold an eclectic display of modern art from Europe. The new hang, called \u201cFiguring Expressionism,\u201d is weighted toward sculpture, and focused on works brought into the collection by Hanns Swarzenski, a medievalist who conspired with MFA director Perry Rathbone in the 1950s and \u201960s to accrue a collection of modern Expressionist works.\n\nWhat is expressionist art? Is it just blurted, blowsy emotionality, tending toward hysteria?\n\nAnswers proposed here suggest something much more nuanced. The works oscillate between heightened fellow feeling (several describe lovers embracing, though never without strain) and ruthless self-appraisal. The display includes paintings by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, and Oskar Kokoschka, as well as sculptures by K\u00e4the Kollwitz, Kokoschka, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Gerhard Marcks, Max Klinger, and Henry Moore.\n\nTo underline roots and emphasize continuity, examples of earlier expressionist sculpture have been thrown in. The intensity of the interrogations in Kokoschka\u2019s \u201cSelf Portrait as a Warrior,\u201d Franz Xaver Messerschmidt\u2019s 18th-century \u201cThe Hypochondriac,\u201d and Klinger\u2019s bust of Beethoven is tempered by the placid, soothing forms in Marcks\u2019s seated nude, Auguste Rodin\u2019s marble head, and an affecting 12th-century Virgin and Child from Italy.\n\nThe result is an awareness (one you find nowhere, for instance, in French Impressionism) of human suffering, unspooling anguish, and the endless search for some \u2014 any \u2014 kind of reprieve.\n\nThe display in the other half of this first-floor gallery is particularly arresting. Four vertical sculptures have been placed beside one another on a slightly raised platform in a gallery that is otherwise empty, but for a fifth sculpture, also vertical, attached to the wall.\n\nThree of the sculptures are in the modern European tradition, one is from Africa, and one from Egypt.\n\nThe display\u2019s title, \u201cWhat\u2019s a Body? Five Ideas,\u201d derives from the artist who made the wall sculpture, Jannis Kounellis, who once asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s a body, a human body? It\u2019s a column. . . . It\u2019s something linear and mystical, a perfect symbol of humanity.\u201d\n\nDespite their many differences, you can feel something like this quest \u2014 to sublimate our physical containers, to find a simpler, cleaner equivalent in a kind of spiritualized, rising form \u2014 in all five works.\n\nLouise Bourgeois\u2019s \u201cPillar,\u201d a recent acquisition, inspired the display. Pillar is, of course, another word for column. So what does this drive, in all five works, toward a kind of columnar verticality express?\n\nAn instinctive aversion, perhaps, to horizontality and the threat of formlessness; a desire to distance ourselves from mud and ants and slithering things and to get closer to the heavens. The African carving dramatizes this urge: It is a rhythm pounder from the Cote D\u2019Ivoire, used to beat down and purify the earth after burials.\n\nSome museum presentations focus on education. Others, like this one, seem to be enveloped in a cloud of questions. When the questions are good ones, as they are here, the exercise seems more than worthwhile. This is a strong, intelligent display, and we can only hope to see more like it in the future.\n\nAnd speaking of flaunting what you\u2019ve got, let\u2019s hope the MFA gets that memo about Asian art.",

'LIKE' US HERE.\n\nThe Elantra has introduced a Sport version that is actually, well, sporty.\n\nWith a 1.6-liter Turbo GDI four-cylinder engine replacing last year\u2019s 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder and a new design that is reminiscent of the Mazda3, the 2017 Elantra Sport is worth a look for driving enthusiasts looking for a bargain.\n\nHorsepower has been increased from 173 in the 2016 model to 200 in the 2017. Likewise, torque has jumped from 154 pound-feet to 190. Add in a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with paddle shifters along with a multi-link rear suspension that promises a more dynamic driving experience and Hyundai is starting to encroach on Jetta GLI territory.\n\nThe new Elantra Sport also looks the part. Hyundai has dumped the round, Prius-like body of Elantras past in favor of a more angular body with a longer hood and more powerful lines to go with that new, Mazda3-esque grille and elongated headlights.\n\nThe elephant in the room or rather the elephant suspiciously missing from the room is price. It\u2019s not yet clear how much 2017 Elantra Sport will cost or how its price tag will compare to that of the Jetta GLI, the standard bearer in the world of performance-oriented compact sedans. In 2016, the Jetta GLI had an MSRP that was a solid $9,000 more than the Elantra Sport, which clocked in at a little more than $20,000 for a manual transmission.\n\nWith all the reworking and restyling done by Hyundai, it\u2019s tough to imagine it won\u2019t be asking for a little more coin this time around. If the Elantra Sport enters the Jetta GLI\u2019s $30,000 neighborhood, it will be a tough sell for Hyundai; if it leapfrogs Volkswagen pricing all together, then it might be in some real trouble.\n\nThe 2017 Elantra Sport is due to hit dealerships this fall, so we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

The Swedish singer recorded Sweet Child O' Mine, the 1988 rock anthem from Guns N' Roses. Taken by Trees' version, which was also used in the final scene of the 2010 film Life As We Know It starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel, reached number 23 in the UK charts.\n\nSince 2010, the adverts have focused on British songs and singers. Ellie Goulding's cover of Your Song, originally released by Elton John 40 years earlier, peaked at number two in the charts, with sales at the time of 72,292 copies, and topped the UK Official Download Chart. Ms Goulding also performed the song during Prince William and Kate Middleton's first dance at their wedding reception.\n\nJohn Lewis had another success in the same year with its spring campaign, which used a Fyfe Dangerfield cover of Billy Joel's She's Always A Woman.\n\nOften regarded as the best John Lewis Christmas advert, the song from 2011 was the lowest-ranking song on the charts out of all its peers. Amelia Warner, who goes by the stage name of Slow Moving Millie and is married to Fifty Shades of Grey actor Jamie Dornan, sung a cover of Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths. It peaked at number 31 in the official charts.\n\nGabrielle Aplin's cover of The Power of Love, released in 1984 by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, was the first John Lewis advert song to reach number one. It re-entered the top 100 the following Christmas following a seasonal surge in downloads.\n\nLily Allen got a second consecutive number one for the department store with her cover of Somewhere Only We Know, the 2004 indie ballad by Keane. Some of the proceeds from the single, which accompanied the animated tale of a bear and a hare, were donated to Save the Children's Philippine Typhoon Appeal campaign. Ms Allen later said she earned only \u00a38,000 from the song.\n\nJohn Lewis turned to the Beatles for the second time in 2014, having used a version of From Me To You in 2009. New indie singer-songwriter Tom Odell crooned a cover of Real Love, a John Lennon song that was reworked by the three remaining Beatles in 1995. Odell's version reached number seven in the charts.",

Brenda Hwang, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated.\n\nMs. Brooks, 28, is keeping her name. She is an associate specializing in retail law at Sedgwick, a law firm based in San Francisco. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received her law degree cum laude from the University of Michigan. She is a daughter of Kay U. Brooks of Granite Bay, Calif., and Albert L. Brooks of Roseville, Calif.\n\nThe groom, 29, is an associate at Exponent, an engineering and scientific consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He also graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the University of Michigan. He is a son of Karin Kimiecik and Kenneth Kimiecik Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nIn July 2010, Ms. Brooks began a solo backpacking journey that started in Arica, in northern Chile, where she was living with a Chilean family and volunteering as an English teacher at a local high school through a program offered by the Chilean Ministry of Education.\n\nWhile in Chile she also began filing online applications to various law schools in the United States. By the time her backpacking adventure took her to Nicaragua in January 2011, she was starting to hear back from various schools, and would travel to town once a week to look over her responses at an internet cafe.\n\nBy March, still in Nicaragua, she intensified her research on individual schools. But she found limited success getting individuals to send her feedback through postings she made Google and a travel website called Couchsurfing.com.\n\nSo she eventually hatched a plan to connect with both male and female students living in the college towns she was targeting: She figured that those she contacted through OkCupid would be more motivated to respond.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty good way to see what the people who could tell me about life at these schools were all about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site was also free of charge, so I didn\u2019t have to spend any money.\u201d\n\nShe said that she was not interested in finding romance, which is why Ms. Brooks did not initially put her photo on the dating site. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t getting much feedback that way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I eventually decided to use a photo of myself.\u201d\n\nWhen she began researching the University of Michigan, she filtered her search for current graduate students in Ann Arbor, which resulted in a 99 percent match with a guy whose profile obscured his face but who was clearly wearing a shirt from U.C. Berkeley, Ms. Brooks\u2019s alma mater.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a pretty darn clever idea,\u201d said Mr. Kimiecik, the mystery man in the shirt. \u201cI figured this is a person I should definitely help out.\u201d\n\nSo they began corresponding and became online friends.\n\n\u201cHe seemed like a pretty cool person, someone I looked forward to talking to,\u201d said Ms. Brooks, whose interactions with University of Michigan-based Mr. Kimiecik, eventually helped her choose to study law there. \u201cHe seemed warm and kind, but I didn\u2019t know what he looked like because all the photos of him were old and taken at odd angles. It was hard to see his face.\u201d\n\nA month later, Ms. Brooks returned from Nicaragua to her mother\u2019s home in Granite Bay to prepare for law school. Her online exchanges with Mr. Kimiecik were now replaced by phone calls and texting, \u201cand a little bit of flirting,\u201d according to Ms. Brooks.\n\nThe more they flirted, the more he grew interested.\n\n\u201cShe was charming and intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cI also found her to be a warmhearted, positive and perceptive person. I kept wanting to know more and more about her.\u201d\n\nDespite their regular communications, Ms. Brooks still did not know what Mr. Kimiecik looked like, so she asked him to post a more-recent photo. He replied by sending her a photo of himself wearing ski goggles and a ski jacket, which had a hood covering most of his face.\n\n\u201cI thought it was hilarious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also found it wildly frustrating.\u201d\n\nThough he explained the stunt as \u201ca partial joke,\u201d he added, \u201cMy usual reaction to first meeting someone is to keep them at arm\u2019s length before I start telling them my whole life story.\u201d\n\nShe finally got the chance to see him up close when she flew to Michigan, and he picked her up at the airport. Before meeting him at the baggage claim area, she rushed to the bathroom to apply some makeup.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t put stock in anything, but I was hopeful and I wanted to make a good first impression,\u201d she said.\n\nLike the kind of first impression Mr. Kimiecik made on her.\n\n\u201cHe was incredibly handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI was excited to finally be standing next to him.\u201d\n\nThey were soon dating and began living together in August 2012. In July 2013, he proposed to her at Point Reyes National Seashore in California, and when she returned to Granite Bay in February 2014 to begin studying for the bar exam, a 19-month long-distance relationship ensued.\n\nThey were reunited in September 2015, when Mr. Kimiecik, who had earned his Ph.D., went to San Francisco to join Ms. Brooks, who was already working at Sedgwick.\n\n\u201cOur long-distance relationship was reaffirming for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought back to all of those times I was on my own and didn\u2019t need him, but now I was on my own again, and this time I wanted to be with him. I really missed him.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 7, 2016, on page ST12 of the New York edition with the headline: The Man Behind the Mask.

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 Broadband adoption in the U.S. continues to rise, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet & American Life Project. Among adults 18 and older, 70% have broadband access at home \u2014 up from 66% a year ago.\n\nAs Pew notes, that\u2019s a significant increase. But a deeper look at the numbers shows that broadband deployment in the U.S. remains sub-par, especially when you consider that the Internet was invented here, and we\u2019re supposed to be the global leader in innovation.\n\nThe survey considers \u201cbroadband\u201d to be anything that delivers download speeds of 4 Mbps, which is about what the most anemic DSL services provide. That\u2019s actually accurate enough (the FCC uses the same standard) \u2014 and that\u2019s the problem. Akamai reported in April that the average broadband speed in the U.S. had actually grown by 28% in the previous year \u2014 to a pathetic 7.4 Mbps. The U.S. came in eighth in Akamai\u2019s ranking \u2014 just after the Czech Republic, which boasts an average broadband speed of 8.1 Mbps. South Korea placed first, with 14 Mbps. Japan\u2019s average was 10.8.\n\nMORE: The Microsoft CEO candidate no one is discussing\n\nParts of Pew\u2019s survey report assume that smartphones provide \u201cbroadband access.\u201d That might help make the digital divide seem a bit narrower, as long as you don\u2019t think about it too much. Yes, you can watch movies on your phone, but even if the movies run smoothly, watching them can quickly eat up data caps and cost money.\n\nOtherwise, Pew reports that while 90% of college graduates have broadband in their homes, only 37% of non-high school graduates and 54% of those making less than $30,000 a year do. There are racial differences, too, but according to Pew, ownership of smartphones among blacks and Hispanics nearly bridges that gap.\n\nIn some ways, that makes sense. If you have neither in-home broadband nor a smartphone, you\u2019re way behind someone with one or both. But that shouldn\u2019t lead us to believe that owning a smartphone makes up for the lack of home broadband.\n\nLaw professor Susan Crawford, who analyzes the communications industry, writes at Wired that counting slow bandwidth at home, and counting smartphones as broadband, \u201callows us to pretend there\u2019s a vibrant marketplace for high-speed Internet access, with satellite duking it out with cable modem access, mobile wireless supplanting the need for a wire at home, and no need for oversight or a change in industrial policy.\u201d",

With some of those pin placements, very tricky. I feel like I'm at a U.S. Open. It's very hard to fit the ball near the holes so that's why you see nobody really running away with it.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old Haas, four strokes ahead after opening with rounds of 66 and 62 to break the tour record for consecutive rounds of par or better at 38, had a 75 to fall a shot behind.\n\n\"I wasn't sharp, obviously, and it was a tough day weather-wise,\" Haas said. \"The wind was blowing a little bit harder coming from a different direction. I was just off just a little bit and that showed.\"\n\nHaas, the oldest player in the field limited to the top 30 on the money list, had a double bogey, six bogeys and three birdies. He hit a female spectator with a shot en route to a bogey on the par-5 eight.\n\n\"I felt awful, obviously,\" Haas said. \"I understand that she's doing OK, but you know, if you've done it, you know what it feels like. It's not a good feeling when she's laying there bleeding and everything. ... If I had been sharp, I would have hit the fairway there and not bothered her. So it's probably her first and last time she's ever been to a golf tournament.\"\n\nHaas won two weeks ago in North Carolina to become the 18th player to win a Champions Tour event at 60 or older. He has 17 victories on the 50-and-over tour after winning nine times on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Frustrating that a good one would have given me a nice cushion,\" Haas said. \"It was a hard day. ... Just one of those days.\"\n\nThe 54-year-old Perry has seven Champions Tour after victories, winning the Regions Tradition in May for his third major title and the 3M Championship in August. He won 14-times on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"I hit the ball fine,\" Perry said. \"Didn't make many putts, but I think the greens have a lot to do with it. All in all, I'm tickled to shoot 68. I'm just playing steady golf, hitting lots of fairways, lots of greens. ... I think it will be exciting tomorrow. It's anybody's day tomorrow. I mean, you've got probably eight to 10 guys who have a very realistic shot of winning this golf tournament. It's just one hot round.\"\n\nThe 55-year-old Pernice won the Principal Charity Classic in Iowa in June for his third tour victory.\n\n\"We had a different wind,\" Pernice said. \"Obviously, brought a little bit of intrigue into most people's game. You get a little bit of wind blowing and firm greens, it's always going to be tough. Jay and I both struggled a little bit today, didn't help each other out much, not much momentum going there. I played good at times. I had my opportunities, I just didn't convert very well.\"\n\nFred Couples and Colin Montgomerie were tied for fourth at 6 under. Couples, the winner last year at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, followed his second-round 64 with a 69. Montgomerie had a 66.\n\nBernhard Langer was tied for 10th at 4 under after a 70. Langer won the Charles Schwab Cup points title last week, has a tour-high five victories -- two of them majors -- and also has wrapped up the season money title with $2,916,189.",

        "text": "Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins opened its defense in court Monday against allegations of sexism by former partner Ellen Pao by attacking her request for millions of dollars in damages.\n\nPao, who has sued her former employer for gender discrimination and retaliation for complaining about it, is seeking $16 million. She has said the amount sends a strong message the Silicon Valley firm for her firing and for making her unemployable as an investor.\n\nBut David Lewin, a former management professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and expert witness for Kleiner Perkins, said he thought the amount was excessive. His argument: Pao didn\u2019t really try hard enough to get a venture capital or higher-paying job and that any lost income from her eventual firing was her own fault.\n\nKleiner\u2019s defense, which kicked off this morning, follows three weeks of testimony by Pao and her witnesses. They painted a picture of a firm in which female employees are passed over for promotions, asked to take notes for male colleagues and are left off the guest list for an important all-male dinner.\n\nTo counter that image, Kleiner Perkins attorney, Lynne Hermle, said she will call a roster of 17 witnesses who are expected to vigorously defend the firm and its behavior. During cross examinations since the trial started, she has gone on the offense against Pao by pushing the idea that she was unqualified for her job and a constant source of drama.\n\nThe high-profile case is being closely followed in the tech industry, which despite its image for innovation, is lot like the smokestack industries before it. Women are in short supply at all levels.\n\nLewin, who was paid $750 per hour Kleiner Perkins to help its case (and has billed more than $86,000 so far), explained a thesis that could be boiled down to two things. The first, is that Pao didn\u2019t broaden her search enough in terms of geography and types of positions. The second is that she had sufficient qualifications to be able to get a great job fairly quickly after leaving Kleiner, but didn\u2019t really try.\n\n\u201cMs. Pao conducted\u2026 a limited search,\u201d Lewin said on the stand. \u201cMy understanding is that she pursued one job in venture capital.\u201d\n\nThe job in question was based in Brazil, and nothing came out of her early conversations with the firm. Lewin later added that, to his knowledge, Pao never sought the help of a headhunting firm or other service that could help her land the type of job she wanted.\n\nLewin also argued that Pao\u2019s education, work experience, extensive network she built, and even the on-the-job mentoring and training she received while at Kleiner would have put her in an excellent position to get a job as an investor, or at least a very well-paying job doing something else. In fact, Lewin believes she should have been able to find \u201ccomparable employment within one to four months\u201d after leaving Kleiner.\n\nPao, who is currently interim CEO of online forum Reddit, could have avoided any damages at all, Lewin said \u2014 that\u2019s $0 in damages, to be exact.\n\nEarlier today, Kleiner\u2019s side kicked off its day of discrediting Pao with a heated cross-examination of Allison West, Pao\u2019s expert witness on employment investigations. West has been asked to discuss all the shortcomings in a third-party investigation Kleiner Perkins paid for following another female partner\u2019s complaints of harassment back in 2012.\n\nKleiner attorney Lynne Hermle tried to shake her confidence: \u201cDid you meet with counsel to discuss your testimony during break?\u201d West explained that they chatted about a female partner\u2019s statements during the investigation, to refresh her memory.",

It is so annoying \u2014 it resembles an agitated strand of hair caught in an old projector lens \u2014 that it nearly renders the film unwatchable. So much for letting your hair down.\n\nThis haircut epitomizes the film\u2019s period phoniness. Despite a grab bag of hip \u201980s issues \u2014 AIDS, cocaine, abortion, gentrification, a nude demonstrator, many poor fashion and lifestyle choices, and everything else Henderson packed into her sprawling bildungsroman \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have a genuine moment.

It made sense at the time.\n\nFor a while, it seems to work, as Jude hooks up with Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld), daughter of his father\u2019s chi-chi mistress, and Johnny (Emile Hirsch), Teddy\u2019s half-brother, who\u2019s into the \u201cstraight edge\u201d punk scene, which eschews drugs for the natural high of Jesus/Krishna worship. Jude sees the light when he wakes up from a bad \u2019shrooms trip to have an earnest heart-to-heart talk with Johnny and Eliza while incense swirls, candles burn, and Hare Krishnas dance and chant.

The email didn't go into detail. \"Business casual\" was the term used.\n\nThat morning, I put on my khakis, blue button-down shirt and nice loafers, hopped in a cab and went to the office. I played it safe \u2014 right down the middle. We would later call this, \"The Wall Street Jumpsuit.\"\n\nRead MoreThe escort indicator: Wall Street is booming again\n\nThat's one of the most basic rules: Keep it simple. Don't draw attention to yourself. You can mix and match and move things around, but leave the crazy individual fashion statements for the club.\n\nAs I made my way to the desk, everyone looked different. It was like when you're in fourth grade and you'd see your elementary teacher at the grocery store. You realize, hey, they're actually a real person! It was like a peek behind the curtain to their personality.\n\nAnd scrutiny was at an all-time high.\n\nI flipped on my computer and started getting ready for the day. That's when I saw a Hawaiian shirt strolling by. I did a double-take and immediately exchanged a look with my desk-mate Lauren. We both giggled. To some, a Hawaiian shirt might symbolize a fun loving and carefree guy.\n\nBut just because you can do it doesn't mean you should. Don't get me wrong, I built an entire career on being different \u2014 but it has limits.\n\nRead MoreSummer in the Hamptons will be sizzling\n\nA few weeks later, a female co-worker was wearing something that looked like it could be balled up on Kim Kardashian's bedroom floor. It was white and basically see-through. She looked great \u2014 maybe too great. Although this was long before Twitter existed, her white shirt was trending throughout the entire company. Employees from different departments were getting emails and then finding excuses to stop by the 37th floor to catch a look.\n\nBeyond the murmuring, sideways glances and damage to your reputation, a Casual Friday faux pas could get you slapped with an unwanted nickname forever (not just during your time at the company). You're branded for life. And you can't recover from this.\n\nSo, with the help of some of my friends, here's a list of some of the more infamous nicknames on Wall Street that came straight from Casual Friday:\n\n\"Black Jeans.\" I'm not sure if it was solely because of the color of his jeans. It might have also had something to do with the tightness of them. But this gentleman was called Black Jeans for years. In private, of course. You don't want to be rude.\n\n\"Coldplay.\" The dude wore the shirt once. But it was more of his reaction that created the nickname that would stick for the rest of his time at the company. He adamantly defended himself by saying he didn't like the band, but he liked the colors of the shirt. The lesson here is: Don't defend your mistakes.\n\n\"Da Plane!\" A woman in Chicago chose to wear a shirt that was fully revealing in the back. All of her peers got to see the monster ink she was representing. Her entire back was tatt'd up. So, taking from the show, \"Fantasy Island,\" they decided the best nickname for her was Tattoo's catch phrase, \"Da Plane! Da Plane!\"\n\nSFP (a.k.a, \"Sorry For Partying\"). Thursday nights were epic for this guy and he would always apologize for it the next day. \"I'm sorry for partying,\" he would spout the next morning. And he was really sorry the day he accidentally came to work wearing two different kinds of shoes. This is not considered casual; it's considered still drunk.\n\nJBF (\"Just Been F\u2026.\"). Her hair screamed, \"I just had sex!\" Apparently her boyfriend's apartment was right near the office and that's where she slept on Thursday nights. You can get a pass for smelling like Taco Bell and Patron, but at least put a comb through your hair.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say these things will stick with you FOR LIFE. If I bumped into Black Jeans on the street today, I'd still call him Black Jeans.\n\nRead MoreHelicopter to your beach house? There's an app for that\n\nButtons. Yes, those seemingly benign things on your shirt \u2014 they, too, can break you. How many buttons unbuttoned is acceptable? The answer is: Two. (Personally, I'm more of a three-button guy.) Four? BUZZER! Unacceptable. Nobody wants to see your impressive amount of chest hair and the office isn't cocktail hour in the Hamptons. So, unbutton at your own risk.\n\nThis is not to diss all casual attire, but rather to say that there is a time and place for your Nantucket Reds, your club logo'd golf shirt, the tight-fitting ensemble and boat shoes without socks. Just not on Wall Street. Not on Casual Friday.\n\nSo, the next time a Wall Streeter with a black card steps to the register holding a new wardrobe, they shouldn't be asking themselves: How much will this cost? They should be wondering: What could this potentially cost me if I wear it at the office?\n\nIf you don't work on Wall Street, aloha! Enjoy that Hawaiian shirt.",

King found Tuesday that the song\u2019s original copyright, obtained by the Clayton F. Summy Co. from the song\u2019s writers and bought for $15 million in 1988 by Warner/Chappell Music Inc., only covered specific piano arrangements of the song and not its lyrics.\n\nThe basic \u2018\u2018Happy Birthday\u2019\u2019 tune, derived from another popular children\u2019s song, \u2018\u2018Good Morning to All,\u2019\u2019 has long been in the public domain, and King\u2019s decision, though it could be appealed, makes the entirety fair game for use.\n\n\u2018\u2018\u2019Happy Birthday\u2019 is finally free after 80 years,\u2019\u2019 Randall Newman, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOne of the co-plaintiffs, Ruypa Marya of the music group Ruypa & The April Fishes, also praised the decision as momentous, saying \u2018\u2018I hope we can start reimagining copyright law to do what it\u2019s supposed to do \u2014 protect the creations of people who make stuff so that we can continue to make more stuff.\u2019\u2019\n\nMarya, said she had paid Warner/Chappell $455 to include the song on a live album during which members of her band and audience sang the song to her the night before her birthday.\n\nWarner/Chappell has said it doesn\u2019t try to collect royalties from just anyone singing the song but those who use it in a commercial enterprise.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are looking at the court\u2019s lengthy opinion and considering our options,\u2019\u2019 Warner/Chappell said in a statement following Tuesday\u2019s ruling.\n\nKing\u2019s decision comes in a lawsuit filed two years ago by Good Morning To You Productions Corp., which is working on a documentary film tentatively titled \u2018\u2018Happy Birthday.\u2019\u2019 The company challenged the copyright, arguing that the song should be \u2018\u2018dedicated to public use and in the public domain.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Because Summy Co. never acquired the rights to the \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 lyrics, defendants, as Summy Co.\u2019s purported successors-in-interest, do not own a valid copyright in the Happy Birthday lyrics,\u2019\u2019 King concluded in his 43-page ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit also asked for monetary damages and restitution of more than $5 million in licensing fees it said in 2013 that Warner/Chappell had collected from thousands of people and groups who\u2019ve paid to use the song over the years.\n\nMarshall Lamm, a spokesman for one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said that issue would be determined later.\n\nIn his ruling King went into great detail about the history of \u2018\u2018Happy Birthday To You,\u2019\u2019 and its derivation from \u2018\u2018Good Morning to All.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat song was written by sisters Mildred Hill and Patty Hill sometime before 1893, the judge said, adding that the sisters assigned the rights to it and other songs to Clayton F. Summy, who copyrighted and published them in a book titled \u2018\u2018Song Stories for the Kindergarten.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018The origins of the lyrics to Happy Birthday ... are less clear,\u2019\u2019 the judge continued, adding the first known reference to them appeared in a 1901 article in the Inland Educator and Indiana School Journal.\n\nThe full lyrics themselves, King said, didn\u2019t appear in print until 1911.\n\nSince then, they have become the most famous lyrics in the English language, according to Guinness World Records.

        "text": "Rachel Whiteread's art is almost entirely concerned with the places where we live, and the places where we might also die. In the end, it all comes down to the empty room, the table and chair, the space under the stairs, the mattress and the bath, the light switch, keyhole and door knob, a life packed away in a cardboard box on a shelf. It's an art of understatement and reserve: she knows how much and how little to say, leaving us space to think and interpret. Simple things fixate her in the same way that they might loom in the imagination of a child.\n\nThe show of Whiteread's drawings at Tate Britain is a kind of reconstruction of her career to date, starting from the late 1980s (a further show of drawings, and a new sculpture, are also at London's Gagosian). The Tate show reveals her preoccupations in a way that is direct, intimate and readable. A few sculptures \u2013 including her 1988 felt-covered Closet, and a 1995 model for her Holocaust memorial in Vienna, finally erected in 2000 after a long political wrangle \u2013 punctuate the exhibition, but the real fascination lies in her drawings and collages.\n\nWhiteread's sculptures often present a kind of monumental blankness that resists us, while her drawings are more revealing. With their delicate fields of paint, their freehand lines in ink and pencil, and their layers of typewriter correction fluid, these small-scale works have an approachability we don't often feel in the presence of her sculptures. They might capture the brooding presence of a closed door, or a seemingly endless flight of stairs, which appears more exhausting to contemplate than to actually climb. Taking an old furniture advertisement, with its half-tone pictures of heavily upholstered settees and easy chairs (\"3-piece suite \u00a321\"), Whiteread obscures the entire page with dull grey paint, leaving only a single ugly chair, sitting in dismal isolation. The image looks like a memory from a 1950s childhood, the gigantic, lumbering chair a stand-in for adult presence.\n\nThere are no people in Whiteread's art, but their presence is everywhere: the spills of varnish that bleed beyond the contours of a drawing of a table; the way tracing paper puckers around a layer of yellow acrylic that describes a bed (ending up looking like a rumpled sheet); the spatters that surround a drawing of a bath. All these hint at human occupation and bodily traces. The plainness of her outline drawings of rooms, windows and house frontages invite the viewer to project occupants \u2013 and domestic scenes \u2013 on to them.\n\nOnly one group of drawings makes direct reference to the human form. These are a number of outlines of child-like heads, seen mostly from above; they were meant as studies for a font for St Paul's Cathedral, which never came to fruition. One inspiration for them was a 15th-century diagram of a head by Piero della Francesca, an Italian artist and mathematician.\n\nWhiteread's pencil and correction fluid outlines wobble across the paper, their apparent tentativeness itself a kind of liveliness. The works have a frankness, a lack of affectation or mannerism, which to my mind makes them all the more approachable and direct. They have a sort of winning honesty: they are more about ideas than demonstrations of graphic skill. One group describes a parquet floor, with a herringbone pattern. In one white-on-black drawing, the wood blocks click-clack across the paper, the pattern undulating like an ocean swell, just as it might to the eyes of a child. The whole thing has a seasick quality. Stray blobs punctuate the wonky, out-of-kilter pattern. Ruskin wrote somewhere of his own boyhood fascination with the whorls on floorboards and the patterns on the carpet, as he played on the floor with a bunch of old keys for a toy. Some of Whiteread's drawings capture just such a state of reverie, provoking a similar daydream-state in the viewer.\n\nIt is now more 20 years since Whiteread made Ghost, her seminal plastercast of the interior space of a Victorian front room. When it was finally shown, the sculpture looked inevitable: so simple, so direct, so unfussy, never mind the complications of making, removing and assembling the sections of the cast. Ghost looked both familiar and uncanny, making the kind of room many of us in Britain have grown up in, and continue to live in, appear suddenly alien and strange. It gives us a jolt.\n\nThis same spirit is in Whiteread's overpainted photographs of a terrace in Hoxton Square, and a decrepit row of houses in Mile End, east London, one of which Whiteread eventually used as the mould for House, the 1993 work that made her international reputation. In the photographs, we see walls, doors and windows effaced by thick, pasty Tippex, creating ghostly presences amid the builder's rubble, the scaffolding and the crumbling brickwork; the Tippex drowns out the London grime, the signs of occupation and dereliction.\n\nFurther on in the show, there are postcards of cloisters and medieval church interiors, the images punctured by numerous round holes, letting in air and light, and dizzying the architecture with a colander of holes. Other postcards are edited with paint, correction fluid and scribbled ink, leaving mysterious, ambiguous half-images. These reworked postcards, we are told, are the sorts of thing the artist works at on her travels, sitting in hotel rooms.\n\nIs that a human intestine?\n\nThe show concludes with a selection of objects collected by the artist, providing a further clue to her thinking. There are little groups of doll's house furniture, a number of bird houses (looking like weatherbeaten beach huts), and the glass cast of what seems to be a human intestine. Old tin jelly moulds and casts of the human brain sit alongside bits of fossil, a chunk of the Berlin wall and \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 a cast of the comedian Peter Sellers's nose. What the artist's eye alights on, and delights in, is always fascinating. These talismanic objects feed Whiteread's imagination in unaccountable ways. Just having them around might provoke a thought, an idea, a new beginning.\n\nKafka, talking about the process of writing, wrote that there was no reason to leave one's desk: that if you sit there long enough, the world \"will writhe before you\". So it is with Whiteread's art. Work often springs from a kind of creative emptiness, and frequently involves a lot of footling around, doing nothing and waiting \u2013 for an idea, for frustration to goad you into action, for some small shift in the atmosphere or for the light that sets the mind free. Ask any writer how much time is spent staring at the wall, looking out of the window, arse-scratching and prevaricating. A lot of visual art \u2013 and of writing and perhaps music, too \u2013 reflects on this, and even uses it as the basis of a work itself. Unlike the sculptor's studio, with its piles of materials, equipment and bustling assistants, drawings are mostly made seated alone at a table in a room, in introspective quiet. In Whiteread's art, the room is where things begin \u2013 and where the world starts to writhe.\n\nRachel Whiteread Drawings is at Tate Britain, London SW1, tomorrow until 16 January.

        "text": "If you\u2019ve been following nutrition (or Silicon Valley) news, you\u2019ve probably heard of Soylent, the milky meal replacement boasting all the nutrients you need\u2014in portable, swiggable form. Soylent CEO and founder Rob Rhinehart, who I interviewed a year ago, created Soylent because he thinks eating is \u201cinefficient\u201d and because he\u2019s just not that interested in food. Apparently he\u2019s not alone: His drink has earned a fan following, with packs of Soylent selling on Ebay for $115. And it\u2019s also earned some competition: Ambronite.\n\nWhat makes Ambronite different: Soylent is made of powdered supplements whereas Ambronite is an all-natural, organic meal-drink that uses pulverized real-food ingredients, says co-founder Simo Suoheimo, who lives in Finland. Ambronite\u2019s 20 blended ingredients include oats, walnuts, apple, spirulina, and seabuckthorn, and everything is organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, and with no artificial ingredients. One serving has 500 calories (you can always use just half), only four grams of natural sugar, 50% of your daily total fiber needs, and over half of your protein intake.\n\nLike the Soylent guys, Ambronite\u2019s creators developed their product because they\u2019re busy businessmen who were eating too much junk between meetings. \u201cWe wanted to make a product that has the best ingredients the planet has to offer,\u201d says Suoheimo. Unlike Rhinehart, though, Suoheimo says he loves cooking and he loves food.\n\n\u201cThis is not me giving you a multivitamin and saying you\u2019re all set,\u201d Suoheimo says. \u201cI am giving you the best, real ingredients out there, based on what we know about nutrition now.\u201d Instead of regularly replacing full meals with Ambronite, Suoheimo hopes his drink will replace things like protein bars, which are full of processed ingredients and sweeteners.\n\nWhat it tastes like: Ambronite starts as a greenish powder, and it\u2019s recommended you blend or shake it well. On my first try, I simply added the powder to a glass of water and attempted to blend it with a coffee stirrer. Bad idea. It was chunky, and tasted like nothing other than a hint of fishy spirulina. The second time, my editor brought me a bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice. I poured in the green powder and shook it until it looked like a smoothie. This time, it wasn\u2019t so bad. In fact, it was really pretty good\u2014though still a bit chewy.\n\nI had some colleagues try it too. \u201cIt tastes like a smoothie I made myself,\u201d said my coworker Kelly Conniff, commenting on the texture. Another coworker was truly surprised it didn\u2019t taste terrible.\n\n\u201cThis is not a chocolate smoothie,\u201d says Suoheimo. \u201cWe are really proud of these ingredients and we want you to taste them.\u201d\n\nAlthough I enjoyed it mixed in with orange juice, the sugar from juice kind of defeat the purpose of drinking something so healthy. Blending it with a frozen banana and some water might be better. Suoheimo says some customers use the powder in their baking or mixed into their curry.\n\nWhere it\u2019s available: Ambronite is still crowdfunding, although they reached their goal of $50,000 in less than a week. People pre-ordering online can get 10 meals of Ambronite for $89, which includes shipping to the United States.\n\nThe bottom line: Though I am forever an advocate for eating whole, real food, I\u2019m not turning my nose up at Ambronite just yet. Real ingredients over supplements is always the way to go, so I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve ditched the fake stuff. The team also relies on nutrition experts from the University of Helsinki, an institution known for it\u2019s dedication to food science. Still, there are no studies that show drinking your daily nutrients leads to better health, and there are other reasons for sitting down and sharing a meal that matter beyond your nutritional intake. I\u2019ll probably be sticking to food that doesn\u2019t come in a pouch, but if you want to try Ambronite for yourself, go for it. Just make sure you blend it really well.",

        "text": "02/09/2016 AT 09:20 AM EST\n\nThe Maryland Attorney General's Office and defense attorneys for Adnan Syed, the convicted murderer at the center of the popular podcast\n\n, rested their cases late Monday afternoon after four days of testimony in a hearing to determine if he will get a new trial.\n\nBoth sides are expected to make closing arguments Tuesday in a Baltimore courtroom before Judge Martin Welch. It is expected that the judge will issue a written opinion at a later date, court personnel told reporters.\n\nSyed is serving a life sentence for the murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999. At the time, the pair were seniors at Baltimore's Woodlawn High School.\n\nIn order to get a new trial, Syed's attorneys must convince Welch that Syed's former defense attorney not only made questionable decisions but that the defense was \"constitutionally deficient.\"\n\nCourtesy of Yusuf Syed / AP Photo\n\nOn Monday, Davis Irwin, a renowned Baltimore defense attorney and former US Attorney testified that the failure of Syed's original defense attorney, Maria Gutierrez, to contact a potential alibi witness shows \"she was ineffective and constitutionally so, I'm afraid.\"\n\nIrwin said Gutierrez, had a \"mandated duty\" to interview all alibi witnesses, including Asia McClain, a classmate of Syed's. Days after his arrest in February 1999, McClain said she wrote two letters stating she was with him in a public library after school during the time prosecutors say Syed was strangling Lee to death.\n\nSyed's original defense team knew of McClain's account, according to new evidence presented at the hearing. But they never contacted her, McClain testified last week.\n\nSyed's current defense team says this note came from Syed's former defense team and shows they knew that Asia McClain had been with Syed in the library\n\nIrwin testified that the failure to call McClain\n\n, adding that it \"takes away the confidence in the verdict.\"\n\nDeputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah has said it was a \"strategic decision\" on the part of Gutierrez not to call McClain.\n\nBut Irwin did not believe that theory to be credible. \"The potential alibi witness cried out to be investigated,\" Irwin said. \"You argued that is a strategic decision. That is no strategy.\"\n\nThe other aspect of Syed's request for a new trial is tied to cell phone evidence used to convict Syed.\n\nHis attorneys claim that cell tower data from two incoming calls used to place Syed in a park the night Lee disappeared, and where her body was later recovered, were inaccurate.\n\nAT&T had sent a fax cover sheet warning that incoming calls were not reliable to determine location, yet Syed's original attorneys as well as the cell phone expert used by the state never knew about the warning, his current defense says.\n\nThe fax cover sheet from AT&T\n\nOn Monday, an FBI cell phone expert testified that contrary to the AT&T warning, the cell tower data linking Syed to the area of Leakin Park was accurate, and that he backs the state's expert who testified at the 2000 trial.\n\nSpecial Agent Chad Fitzgerald said the records he saw are \"accurately reliable\" and that the analysis of AT&T engineer Abraham Waranowitz at the trial \"was very good and very thorough.\"\n\nHowever, Waranowitz signed a sworn affidavit last fall in which he wrote that had he been aware of the disclaimer \"it would have affected my testimony,\" and that he could not have said where a phone was located until he understood the reasons for the disclaimer.\n\nFitzgerald also accused C. Justin Brown, one of Syed's attorneys, of giving him manipulated cell phone records with cut off dates and times to review. \"It's offensive to me,\" Fitzgerald said, his voice rising.\n\nBrown responded by saying it was these very same cell records that Syed's original attorney was given to work with. \"If you can't understand it,\" Brown said, \"how in the world could Christina Gutierrez understand it?\"",

        "text": "It\u2019s not easy to impress a billionaire, but the Skyacht One \u2014 an $83m customized private jet that takes to new heights the notion of airborne opulence \u2014 just might leave a Saudi prince or Silicon Valley magnate totally gobsmacked.\n\nThe Skyacht is the brainchild of former Disney executive and experiential designer Eddie Sotto, founder of SottoStudios/LA. But the aircraft he imagined is anything but cartoonish. Using the Embraer Lineage 1000E business jet as a platform, the Skyacht\u2019s nautical- and navigation-themed interior fairly screams refined elegance and luxury \u2014 a high-flying paean to all things sumptuous and lavish.\n\nWhat does $83m buy? Think details like a handmade brass-and-marquetry clock inspired by the renowned 15th-Century studiolo built for the Ducal Palace in Gubbio, Italy. Fornasetti rugs. British campaign-style furnishings. Loads of embossed leather. Bejeweled controls made of engraved brass, gold, platinum and silver. Brass inlaid window bezels surrounded by planked-mahogany panels. Shagreen-covered chairs. Intelligent cabin lighting that changes colors according to the time of day. And a richly appointed captain\u2019s quarters (aka a bedroom) that would make a perfect lair for Captain Nemo Nemo \u2013 that is, if he\u2019d gone capitalist and made millions commercializing the Nautilus for undersea intercontinental travel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, so perhaps some of that leaked into the design,\u201d says Sotto, once named by TED founder Richard Saul Wurman as one of America\u2019s top 1,000 most creative people. \u201cIt\u2019s fitting because in nautical culture, Captain Nemo is the biggest disruptor \u2014 and innovator \u2014 of all.\u201d\n\nThe former senior vice president of concept design at Disney's Imagineering division, Sotto\u2019s creative bona fides just might be genetic; his grandfather was a scenic and portrait artist at MGM Studios and an aunt was a costume illustrator and designer at Paramount and Universal before landing at Disney.\n\nAs such, the Skyacht embodies Sotto\u2019s flair for cinematic, storytelling design and an affinity for authenticity. \u201cI felt something was missing in the private-jet experience,\u201d he says, noting that while many high-end aircraft are filled with elegant finishes and flourishes, they lack heart and soul \u2014 and a sense of story.\n\n\u201cThink of it this way: People of means drive cars like Bentleys and wear Cartier watches \u2014 items with a legacy of design that goes back generations,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut aircraft, being so new, rely more on elegance and less on richness of design or story.\n\n\u201cMy design process is more cinematic,\u201d he continues. \u201cI think like a movie director would think. I figure out what would elicit an emotional response \u2014 like \u2018Wow!\u2019 \u2014 and move backward from there. Call it form follows feeling.\u201d\n\nMy design process is more cinematic. I think like a movie director would think. I figure out what would elicit an emotional response \u2014 like \u2018Wow!\u2019 \u2014 and move backward from there. Call it form follows feeling.\n\nAs the Skyacht\u2019s name implies, Sotto found his design muse, oddly enough, in the classic wooden motor yachts of the mid-1900s, like the Chris-Craft Riviera. That inspiration is reflected in the belly of the Skyacht\u2019s fuselage and on its stabilizer, which feature hand-painted faux mahogany \u201cplanks\u201d that mimic those boats of yesteryear.\n\nSotto was inspired by one boat in particular: the Thunderbird, built in 1940 for millionaire playboy and real-estate mogul George Whittell Jr to use at his Thunderbird Lodge on Lake Tahoe. The Thunderbird\u2019s DNA emerged from the gleaming fuselage of Whittell\u2019s personal airplane, a classic Douglas DC-2, also called Thunderbird.\n\n\u201cThe fact that George Whittell built a yacht to match his plane and it came out so beautiful taught me that those two worlds are closer than you think,\u201d Sotto says. \u201cI found it very exciting to think about a yacht that can fly.\n\n\u201cThe romance of those classic yachts with their planks and joinery \u2014 the way they\u2019re built, with all the engineering exposed \u2014 is timeless,\u201d he says, \u201cThe craftsmanship is literally right before your eyes. Every line is an elegant sculptural element. Every plank of wood serves an aerodynamic purpose \u2014 they\u2019re put together like a watch in a very precise way.\u201d\n\nAside from vintage motor yachts, the qua sine non of the Skyacht\u2019s design is the romance of Old World travel and navigation, as evidenced by the astrolabes, armillary spheres, charts and other navigational elements that repeat throughout the interior, right down to the Piero Fornasetti gold-plated dinner china. Those elements represent yet another nod to Sotto\u2019s passion for authenticity and storytelling, which he says creates a far more emotional design than merely designing a building or a trendy interior.\n\nSotto says the Skyacht is aimed directly at people \u201cwho love disruption \u2014 who like to see impossible things happen. At Disney, I learned that impossible is not a barrier, it\u2019s just a checkpoint.\u201d The Skyacht has generated interest from confidential clients, but Sotto expects that customers will change the cabin configuration as designed and personalise the interior. \u201cThe $83m is a number that safely delivers what you see,\u201d he says. \u201cBut customers will want to make changes in a bespoke way. This is merely a platform design \u2014 an invitation to dream.\u201d Or wish upon a star.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this or anything else you have seen on BBC Autos, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Both the hospital and the health department are named as defendants.\n\nThe suit is the latest in a string of aggressive steps by the friends group to halt the proposal, including an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the attorney general that the hospital must be required to keep the garden in perpetuity.\n\nThe objections center around the hospital\u2019s plan to build an 11-story tower on the site of the Prouty Garden, a half-acre patch that for decades has served as a place of solace for families struggling with serious illness.\n\n\u201cBottom line, we allege that Boston Children\u2019s Hospital jumped the gun,\u201d said Greg McGregor, a Boston attorney representing the group.\n\nThe friends group has brought the hospital project \u2014 and the garden\u2019s significance \u2014 to the attention of a wider audience beyond patients\u2019 families and doctors. An online petition to preserve Prouty has amassed about 16,000 signatures, and organizers have mobilized Saturday morning vigils outside the hospital during the month of April.\n\nIn addition to an injunction, the lawsuit requests that the state consider classifying the garden as important clinical space, not just a place of sentimental significance. A hearing on the injunction has been set for May 3.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Public Health said in a statement that health officials will review the lawsuit, but declined to comment on specifics, citing the department\u2019s policy on litigation.\n\nIn a statement, Children\u2019s also declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, citing the hospital\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cFor more than three years, Boston Children\u2019s has pursued our project to build a clinical building on our Longwood campus to meet the needs of our patients and staff and the growing demand for our care,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThroughout the public process we\u2019ve earned approval at every step of the way.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to state public health officials dated April 8, an attorney for the hospital denied the opposition\u2019s claims that the hospital has already begun work on the project. The letter stated that any work currently happening on the property is unrelated.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s proposed new tower at its 300 Longwood Ave. campus would include a pediatric heart center, neonatal intensive care unit, and private rooms. Hospital executives have previously said that the use of Prouty Garden land will help address overcrowding and create more room for doctors and nurses to treat patients.\n\nTo make up for the loss of Prouty Garden, hospital officials plan to open an 8,000-square-foot garden on the 11th floor of Children\u2019s main building in 2017.",

        "text": "The social media universe became furious at KFC this week after an employee reportedly asked a 3-year-old victim of a dog attack to leave one of their restaurants because \u201cher face is disrupting our customers.\u201d\n\nRead a response to this piece from the American Pit Bull Foundation.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t KFC employees who broke down the door to Victoria Wilcher\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house and mauled the toddler until half her face was paralyzed and she lost the use of one of her eyes. Three pit bulls did that.\n\nPit bulls make up only 6% of the dog population, but they\u2019re responsible for 68% of dog attacks and 52% of dog-related deaths since 1982, according to research compiled by Merritt Clifton, editor of Animals 24-7, an animal-news organization that focuses on humane work and animal-cruelty prevention.\n\nClifton himself has been twice attacked by dogs (one pit bull), and part of his work involves logging fatal and disfiguring attacks. Clifton says that for the 32 years he\u2019s been recording, there has never been a year when pit bulls have accounted for less than half of all attacks. A CDC report on dog-bite fatalities from 1978 to 1998 confirms that pit bulls are responsible for more deaths than any other breed, but the CDC no longer collects breed-specific information.\n\nAnother report published in the April 2011 issue of Annals of Surgery found that one person is killed by a pit bull every 14 days, two people are injured by a pit bull every day, and young children are especially at risk. The report concludes that \u201cthese breeds should be regulated in the same way in which other dangerous species, such as leopards, are regulated.\u201d That report was shared with TIME by PETA, the world\u2019s largest animal-rights organization.\n\nThe little girl\u2019s grandfather shot and killed the three dogs that attacked her, and both he and his girlfriend are facing child-endangerment charges. KFC has donated $30,000 to the girl\u2019s family to help with her medical bills, and more money keeps flooding in. But so far the outrage has been directed at the rude KFC employee, not at the growing problem of pit-bull maulings.\n\nAs pit-bull attacks become more and more common, they\u2019re getting increasing attention on social media, but not always in support of the wounded children. In March, a Facebook petition to save Mickey, a dangerous pit bull in Phoenix, got over 70,000 likes. Mickey was facing euthanasia for mauling 4-year-old Kevin Vincente so badly that he cracked his jaw, eye socket and cheekbone. Kevin is facing months of reconstructive surgery, but more people were concerned with saving the dog than helping the boy. Mickey\u2019s Facebook page has now become a social-media landing page to save other dogs that are considered dangerous.\n\nClifton says he\u2019s seen an unprecedented rise in dog maulings in recent years, as more pit bulls enter the shelter system. Between 1858 and 2000, there are only two recorded instances of shelter dogs killing humans. From 2000 to 2009, there were three fatal attacks involving shelter dogs (one pit bull, one breed similar to a pit bull, and one Doberman). But from 2010 to 2014, there have been 35 shelter dogs who fatally attacked humans. All but 11 were pit bulls.\n\nSupporters say pit bulls are getting a bad rap. Sara Enos, founder and president of the American Pit Bull Foundation, said that it\u2019s wrong to blame dog attacks on pit bulls, because it\u2019s the owners who are to blame. \u201cIt really boils down to being responsible owners,\u201d she said. \u201cAny dog from any breed can be aggressive, it matters how it\u2019s treated.\u201d And, as TIME reported in 2013, pit-bull owners all over the country are trying to rebrand the breed, insisting pit bulls can have a softer side when treated humanely.\n\nMany pit-bull advocacy organizations, including BAD RAP, did not want to comment for this story. But there is a growing backlash against the idea that pit bulls are more violent than other dogs. \u201cThere is not any breed of dog that is inherently more dangerous,\u201d said Marcy Setter of the Pit Bull Rescue Center. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nBut critics say that pit bulls are inherently dangerous no matter how they\u2019re treated, because violence is in their DNA. \u201cWhy do herding dogs herd? Why do pointing dogs point? They don\u2019t learn that behavior, that\u2019s selective behavior,\u201d says Colleen Lynn, president and founder of DogsBite.org, a national dog-bite-victims group dedicated to reducing dog attacks. \u201cPit bulls were specifically bred to go into that pit with incredible aggression and fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery kind of dog is neglected and abused,\u201d Clifton agrees. \u201cAnd not every kind of dog responds to the neglect and abuse by killing and injuring people.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another root cause of the rise in pit-bull attacks, one you might not think of: Hurricane Katrina.\n\nPit bulls are especially popular in Louisiana and Mississippi, and many of the volunteers responding to Hurricane Katrina found themselves saving stranded dogs. Most of the pit bulls they saved had been kept inside and behaved well around the rescuers, Clifton said, because they knew their survival depended on it. The dogs who were rescued were good pit bulls, he says, and \u201cthe real badasses, the ones chained outside, were drowned.\u201d\n\nClifton said that many of the volunteers, who had very little experience with dog rescue, became attached to the breed and involved in pit-bull advocacy. And that helped galvanize the pro-pit-bull movement in the wake of Michael Vick\u2019s 2007 dogfighting scandal. That movement helped encourage more people to adopt pit bulls as lack of sterilization caused the population to grow.\n\n\u201cIf you need a marker in your head for when pit bulls got out of control, it\u2019s 2007 with Michael Vick,\u201d Lynn says. Vick\u2019s high-profile trial for dogfighting and cruelty to animals roused a growing sympathy for pit bulls, which led more people to adopt them and bring them into their homes.\n\n\u201cWe need to get used to mauling injuries, because we\u2019re going to be seeing a lot more of them,\u201d warns Lynn. \u201cEach of us will know a mauled, disfigured child by a known dangerous breed of dog. There will be one in every school.\u201d\n\nBut what can be done about the growing number of pit bulls? Some say the best solution would be breed-specific sterilization, which would curb the pit-bull population and reduce euthanasia in shelters. Most dogs of all breeds are spayed and neutered \u2014 about 80%, by Clifton\u2019s estimation. But only 20% of pit bulls are sterilized, partly because the population that owns pit bulls tends to resist the spay-neuter message. He notes that there are a number of free sterilization programs for pit bulls, including one run by the ASPCA, but that even the largest programs aren\u2019t sterilizing enough pit bulls to reduce the number of shelter intakes.\n\nLynn agrees that breed-specific sterilization laws are the most humane and efficient way to deal with the situation and avoid having more dogs euthanized. \u201cIf you want to hit that \u2018no kill\u2019 status, you better do something about the pit-bull problem.\u201d Pit bulls currently account for 63% of the dogs put down in shelters, but only 38% of the admissions. Lynn says that all pit bulls should be sterilized, except those that come from licensed breeders.\n\nEven PETA, the largest animal-rights organization in the world, supports breed-specific sterilization for pit bulls. \u201cPit bulls are a breed-specific problem, so it seems reasonable to target them,\u201d said Daphna Nachminovitch, PETA\u2019s senior vice president of cruelty investigations. \u201cThe public is misled to believe that pit bulls are like any other dog. And they just aren\u2019t.\u201d Even the ASPCA acknowledges on its website that pit bulls are genetically different than other dogs. \u201cPit bulls have been bred to behave differently during a fight,\u201d it says. \u201cThey may not give warning before becoming aggressive, and they\u2019re less likely to back down when clashing with an opponent.\u201d\n\nOpponents of sterilization argue that it can be difficult to determine which dogs are pit bulls, and that breed-specific efforts are unfair to certain dogs. \u201cWhen you discriminate against a breed, you\u2019re also discriminating against good dogs as well,\u201d Enos said. Setter of Pit Bull Rescue Central opposes breed-specific sterilization because she says it\u2019s ineffective, because the laws don\u2019t target irresponsible owners.\n\nBut Nachminovitch said PETA stands by breed-specific sterilization as a common-sense solution to what has become a human-safety issue. \u201cThese dogs were bred to bait bulls. They were bred to fight each other to the death,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because we\u2019re an animal-rights organization doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not concerned about public safety.\u201d\n\nUpdated: The original version of this story referred to reports that a girl who had been mauled by pitbulls had been asked to leave a KFC restaurant.

        "text": "Over the last two months, I\u2019ve spent countless hours sifting through 50,000 photos and videos my wife has captured throughout our eight-year marriage.\n\nIt was an enlightening experience to re-live old memories, but also see how far smartphone camera functions have come over the years.\n\nAfter the sorting process was complete, I set out to find the perfect online storage solution. The benefits of using a cloud-based storage system are two-fold: Viewing photos (and videos) online is easier than other methods, because they can be accessed on more than one device, and the service acts as an extra backup (you can never have too many).\n\nThe first photo-storage service I tested was Dropbox. The company offers storage plans that range from free for two gigabytes of storage, to $10 per month for up to 1 terabyte. Though free users can earn extra storage by completing random tasks, such as connecting a Facebook account or enabling Camera Upload features on his or her mobile devices. Currently, I have 80.8 gigabytes of free storage thanks to such promotions and offers.\n\nDropbox DROPBOX also offers applications across most platforms, all of which automatically backup your photos and videos without any extra work.\n\nAfterwards I looked at Flickr, once a staple for online photo storage. The company has had to go to great lengths to remain attractive to users, such as providing one free terabyte of storage to every user.\n\nOnce considered a premium feature, now-a-days anyone with a Flickr account can upload years of photos with little effort and without spending a single penny. Using a combination of iOS, Android, and desktop applications (OS X and Windows), users can automatically\u2014and privately\u2014upload photos to the service.\n\nAfter installing the Flickr Mac app and directing it to where my 500 gigabyte photo library was stored, the app scanned my folders and began automatically uploading photos. A surprising feature of the app was that it identifies duplicate photos, automatically skipping them during the upload process. It turns out I had nearly 4,000 duplicate photos in my library.\n\nOne drawback, however, is that the service only uploads photos (unlike its competitors), forcing me to use the website to manually upload videos.\n\nApple\u2019s iCloud Photo Library was recently released through a pair of updates to iOS and OS X, removing the beta tag it had carried for the better part of a year.\n\nThe service can sync photos and videos stored on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to your iCloud account, making your entire library available across all of your iCloud connected devices.\n\nThe obvious benefits for someone surrounded by Apple AAPL products is the seamless integration. Content is automatically uploaded, then easily downloaded with the push of a button: Simply open the photo app on any one of your Apple devices and your photos are available to peruse.\n\nThose with large photo libraries can opt to store smaller, more storage-friendly previews of content on devices to maximize device storage.\n\nThe iCloud Photo Library is the most expensive of the services I looked at: Plans start at free for five gigabytes of space, going all the way up to $20 per month for one terabyte of storage.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Cloud Drive offers unlimited photo storage to Prime members ($99 for the year), but requires users pay $60 per year in order to store videos that go beyond a 5 gigabyte limit.\n\nAfter uploading a small album and struggling to make sense of the web interface, I decided against using the service. Amazon\u2019s AMZN site was hard to navigate, and downright confusing. I soon realized trying to jump between folders and online albums was more work than it should be.\n\nGoogle GOOGL recently launched a new Photos service. So far, I\u2019ve only uploaded small albums for testing purposes, but found the system\u2019s search capabilities far superior than others. The ability to search for something like, say, a pumpkin, and find several photos of my children and I carving pumpkins is mind boggling. Sweetening the pot, Google has also given users unlimited storage space for high-resolution photos and videos.\n\nDespite having tested Google Photos for only a brief amount of time, I\u2019ve decided to go all in. Being able to search for what a photo contains, instead of arbitrary time frames or geo-location data, is what really sold me.\n\nIn the end, the best part about having so many photo storage systems available (short of the time needed to invest in uploading a large library) is I can easily switch between services should my needs change or a service not live up to its promise. We\u2019re lucky to have so many viable options for safekeeping of the precious and sometimes not-so-precious memories we capture on a daily basis.",

        "text": "The mystique of Miles Davis was rooted in the sinister magnetism of his character as much as it was in the nocturnal genius of his music. His nickname was \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019, and in the \u201850s he was a hypnotic reptile of cool, with sunken cheeks and a killer stare that said, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u201d By the late \u201870s and \u201880s, with his tangle of long hair, regal-pimp wardrobe, and iconic rasp (the result of raising his voice too soon after a throat operation), he\u2019d become a deeply transgressive figure, infamous for his drug abuse and violence against women, with a dissolute rock star\u2019s mystery and danger. He seemed like some magnificent creature that had crawled out of a swamp \u2013 the ultimate midnight badass.\n\nMiles Ahead, a free-form biopic directed by its star, Don Cheadle, is a passionate jumble of a movie, a heady plunge into Miles Davis\u2019 persona that doesn\u2019t always bother to make sense of what he did or why he did it. At the center of the film is Cheadle, who slithers deep inside the croaky Davis charisma. Eddie Murphy on Saturday Night Live once memorably compared Davis to a Gremlin, but Cheadle, with lethally pursed lips and iceberg eyes, gets beyond the comic kitsch and recreates the fabled Davis mannerisms in all their ferocity: the stare that turns every encounter into a showdown, the rasp as quietly threatening as Don Corleone\u2019s. Damned if he doesn\u2019t make the man as fascinating as he really was.\n\nThe film opens in the late \u201870s, when Davis, holed up in his townhouse on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, has become a scraggly hermit who has spent the last five years in seclusion without performing or issuing any new recordings. He has now made one, though: a secret session at Columbia Records that has yielded a tape the company wants, and which winds up being stolen from Davis during a party at his home. His attempts to get it back \u2013 a wild downtown car chase, showdowns at gunpoint \u2013 are the frame for this raucous, frazzled section of the movie, which at many points had me siding with Columbia. The company owns the tape, which Davis treats as a rare artefact of his timeless genius. But is that his jazz purity speaking, or it just his crazed, drug-fueled ego? Watching Miles Ahead, we can scarcely separate the two.\n\nThe movie keeps leaping back to the \u201860s, when Davis, having made the 1959 cool-jazz epiphany Kind of Blue (now the best-selling recording in the history of jazz), had become a superstar. What he chooses to do with his freedom and clout is to lord it over everyone in his midst \u2013 and that includes the love of his life, Frances Taylor, played by Emayatzy Corinealdi as an elegant baby doll out of a Mad Men daydream. Taylor is a gifted dancer who Davis marries and then wants to possess. He forces her to stop dancing and rubs his womanising right in her face. And when she protests, he beats her up. Why?\n\nIn contrast to a great biopic like Get on Up, which rooted James Brown\u2019s inexcusable behavior in his complex reaction to racism and his own childhood abandonment, Miles Ahead lacks any true psychology. It basically says: Davis was a raging tyrant \u2013 deal with it! The spectacle of his bad behavior can be horribly transfixing, as bad behavior in biopics so often is, yet the movie needed to give us a richer sense \u2013 some sense \u2013 of the source of his demons.\n\nDavis\u2019 ultimate act of heartbroken fury is to withhold his talent from the world\n\nIt\u2019s the late-\u201870s Miles, for all the slapdash staging of this section of the movie, who we can relate to the most, because there\u2019s a vulnerability that keeps peeking through his tattered facade. He hooks up with a disheveled reporter (Ewan McGregor) who wants to do his comeback story for Rolling Stone, and while this feels like the creakiest device imaginable, Cheadle and McGregor actually develop a compelling chemistry. As the reporter helps Davis score some drugs from a dorm-room dealer, then heads back to Miles\u2019 place for a late-night confessional coke binge, we begin to see that Miles Ahead is really a comedy of depression. The Davis we see has made a mess of his life, and he\u2019s suffering for it, but his ultimate act of heartbroken fury is to withhold his talent from the world \u2013 to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve me.\u201d Can he get over himself?\n\nIn the end, he does, though I wish we\u2019d seen with greater precision how it happened. The closing credits feature Cheadle\u2019s Miles in concert during the early \u201880s, wearing a leather jacket with an insignia that says #SocialMusic. \u201cSocial music\u201d is the term that Miles thinks should be used instead of jazz (\u201ca made-up word,\u201d he says derisively), but all I could think was: nothing was marked with a hashtag in the \u201880s! Surely Cheadle knows this, but the idea seems to be that as a filmmaker, he can be as loose and improvisatory as he wants to be. He may even think that he\u2019s working in the spirit of jazz. But biographical dramas, unlike jazz, need to be grounded in reality. And Cheadle\u2019s performance, while it makes Miles Ahead worth seeing, should have been grounded in a more focused and tough-minded movie.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

        "text": "As Donald Trump\u2019s position at the front of the Republican presidential race has become more and more unshakeable, the media\u2019s attitude towards him has changed gradually from a position of somewhat gleeful ridicule to concern that this man actually has a shot at becoming president of the United States\u2014and that the media itself may have helped put him there.\n\nThe latest example of this theme (one that I explored in a recent post here at Fortune) can be seen in a recent piece by New York Times columnist Nick Kristof, entitled \u201cMy Shared Shame: The Media Helped Make Trump.\u201d In it, the NYT writer says that he and the media are complicit in Trump\u2019s rise, in part because many mainstream outlets gave him so much free coverage during the race, even when he didn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nI polled a number of journalists and scholars, and there was a broad (though not universal) view that we in the media screwed up. Our first big failing was that television in particular handed Trump the microphone without adequately fact-checking him or rigorously examining his background, in a craven symbiosis that boosted audiences for both.\n\nAnn Curry, the former Today show anchor, tells Kristof that \u201cthe media has needed Trump like a crack addict needs a hit,\u201d because he is a ratings gold mine. This view was corroborated recently by CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves, who told a media conference that Trump has been a boon for the TV industry. \u201cThis is going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It\u2019s a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Data Sheet, Fortune\u2018s technology newsletter.\n\nAccording to one recent estimate, Trump has been the beneficiary of close to $2 billion in free media coverage since his campaign began. TV networks have spent more time showing an empty podium or a Trump headshot during his phone interviews than they have on most of the rest of the Republican field. CNN\u2019s ratings have climbed by 170% since the race began.\n\nKristof goes on to say that the media also made a number of other crucial tactical mistakes when it comes to Trump, and the first was to see him as a carnival clown. \u201cThe media made a mistake by covering Trump\u2019s candidacy at the start as some sort of joke or media prank,\u201d Harvard political scientist Danielle S. Allen tells the NYT columnist. The Huffington Post famously tried to cover Trump\u2019s campaign only in its entertainment section, although it eventually had to drop that idea.\n\nAt least part of the reason why Trump was seen as a joke\u2014even after it was obvious that he had a broad level of support\u2014is that most mainstream media outlets underestimated his appeal with U.S. voters. \u201cWe failed to take Trump seriously because of a third media failing: We were largely oblivious to the pain among working-class Americans and thus didn\u2019t appreciate how much his message resonated,\u201d Kristof argues, and it\u2019s hard to disagree.\n\nCNN media analyst Brian Stelter, host of the show Reliable Sources, spent most of his broadcast on Sunday talking about how the media missed the boat on Trump, and how this was at least in part because of a certain snobbery on the part of mainstream media analysts and journalists.\n\nThe bogus \"media created Trump\" meme is just another way elites are not taking Trump seriously.\n\n\u2014 Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) March 27, 2016\n\nOne of the central questions raised by all of this media second-guessing and hairshirt-wearing is this: Could the media really have altered the overall trend of Trump\u2019s rise to prominence and his possible nomination as Republican candidate? If TV shows hadn\u2019t given him so much coverage, or had challenged his erroneous statements more directly, or pointed out his obvious flaws as a president, would that have changed anything?\n\nWe\u2019ll never know the answer to that, because we can\u2019t un-bake the Trump cake. But not everyone is convinced that different media coverage would have resulted in a different outcome. For one thing, even when Trump\u2019s misstatements and racist commentary are singled out or highlighted as a problem, his support never seems to waver. If anything, it grows.\n\nTrump media coverage debate, solved: He is impervious to media criticism, so doesn't matter.\n\n\u2014 Peter Kafka (@pkafka) March 27, 2016\n\nIn a very real sense, regardless of what kind of coverage he and his policies are given by the mainstream press, Trump wins, at least in the eyes of his supporters. If he gets fawning coverage, then it\u2019s obvious how great a candidate he is. If he gets critical coverage, then it\u2019s obvious that he was right about the untrustworthy liberal media\u2014something he routinely criticizes at his rallies\u2014and he still wins.\n\nWatch: \u201cWe want to make media for the way the world is today.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also more than a touch of hubris in the idea that the media has somehow \u201cmade\u201d Donald Trump what he is, or convinced millions of people to support him. The mainstream press might like to think that it has that kind of influence and power over people, the way it theoretically used to, but that\u2019s probably not the case in today\u2019s decentralized media environment.\n\nIn many ways, Trump is a post-media candidate. His Twitter stream, his behavior at presidential debates, his use of radio and TV to push his views through the press who cover those events (which they have to do as professional journalists, as Jeff Zucker of CNN has pointed out in his defense of the network\u2019s Trump coverage) are all carefully calculated.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Trump\u2019s status as a media entity in his own right has been cemented by a captive media industry, desperate for revenue\u2014and not just TV, but plenty of online outlets as well. Is the media alone to blame for his appeal? No. But the early failure to take him seriously let Trump set his own agenda, and the wall-to-wall coverage since then has reinforced the impression that he is unstoppable.\n\nThe mainstream press helped to create this political bed, and now they are being forced to lie in it, and are complaining about how uncomfortable it is.",

        "text": "Valeant\u2019s fourth quarter conference call on March 15 will long be remembered as the kind of public event that did more damage than it mitigated. CEO Michael Pearson had to announce the company missed analysts\u2019 profit targets\u2014Valeant added an extra stumble with a $600 million earnings typo in its press release\u2014and the fact that those results were unaudited. But Pearson made the situation worse with a lack of specificity about the company\u2019s ability to improve its numbers, and the announcement that its annual report, with audited numbers, would not be released any time soon, possibly triggering a breach of its bond agreements. Following the call, Valeant\u2019s already-ailing stock price collapsed, dropping by 51% before trading up 3%, to about $35, on the morning of March 16.\n\nPearson also managed to slag his company\u2019s new partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance, accusing it of not adequately communicating the terms of its partnership with Valeant, under which Walgreens will sell some of the drugs formerly distributed by the now-defunct Philidor. Said Pearson on the conference call: \u201cI think Walgreens did not do a very good job explaining [how the program worked] and then there were aspects of the Walgreens programs that people didn\u2019t like. So I think we\u2019ve done a better job explaining.\u201d\n\nWhat Pearson neglected to mention was that Walgreens, led by global deal-master Stefano Pessina, basically saved Valeant\u2019s bacon by picking up the distribution of many drugs that, without Philidor, would have no outlet. And Pessina made it clear back in January, in an interview with me, that Valeant\u2019s drug prices would sell for lower prices than before\u2013and that he was quite pleased with the terms. Says Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting: \u201cIt shows Pessina and his team negotiating a better deal.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Valeant seems to have rethought its earlier comment. When asked to elaborate on its criticism, Laurie Little, Valeant\u2019s SVP and head of investor relations, sent Fortune the following statement: \u201cAs we said on the call yesterday, our branded access program with Walgreens is off to a terrific start. While there was an initial reaction to the program from some payers, we and Walgreens have been working to explain the features of the program to our channel partners and to address any concerns they may have had. Walgreens is an outstanding partner, and we look forward to continuing our mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d\n\nIn response to this statement, Walgreens has decided to take the high road, it appears. Says a spokesperson: \u201cWe agree the program is off to a good start. We also were pleased that Valeant addressed some initial concerns from some payers regarding their program and it has been positively received.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s a lesson in there: when you\u2019re down, maybe don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.",

There are no public records of how much money or angst Coppola and Franco have, but neither one of them is directionless.\n\nOver the past decade or so, Franco, 36, has jumped all over the place as an actor, from serious roles in the \u201cSpider-Man\u201d trilogy and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d for which he was Oscar nominated, to outright goofiness in \u201cPineapple Express\u201d and \u201cThis Is the End.\u201d He\u2019s directed almost two dozen shorts and features (\u201cBukowski\u201d and \u201cThe Sound and the Fury\u201d are due for release this year), he\u2019s an accomplished painter, is working on a PhD in English at Yale, and in 2010, just after completing an MFA at Columbia, had \u201cPalo Alto\u201d published.\n\nCoppola, 27, the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola, niece of Sofia Coppola, and cousin of extended Coppola family members Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman, earned a degree in photography at Bard College. But after getting her feet wet directing a few offbeat videos, she\u2019s now joined the ranks of the Coppola filmmaking dynasty by adapting and directing her first feature.\n\nFranco and Coppola shared a joint phone conversation from New York to discuss \u201cPalo Alto.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote the book when I was still at Columbia,\u201d said Franco. \u201cIt took me almost five years, and when it was finished, I started thinking about it as a movie. But I didn\u2019t want to adapt it myself. I was adapting other people\u2019s work, and I really like the kinds of things that come out of collaborations, and how material could go into new areas when different voices were brought it.\u201d\n\nFranco was introduced to Coppola around that time, saw some of her photos and videos, and believed she might be the right person to turn his book into a film.\n\n\u201cI thought she had the right spirit and the right sensibility,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just went with my instinct, called her up, and asked her if she wanted to adapt my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, first there was an e-mail,\u201d she said, \u201cand it was, \u2018Hey, nice to meet you; let\u2019s do a project together.\u2019 He presented a few different ideas, but \u2018Palo Alto\u2019 sounded the most interesting because even though I had just finished college, I already had enough separation to kind of look at it nostalgically, at least for the teenage years. When I read the book I fell in love with it; I hadn\u2019t seen anything that depicted teenagers in such an accurate way.\u201d\n\nBut she admits that before jumping onboard the project, there were a few butterflies, or at least some concern about dealing with being the newest Coppola in town.\n\nAsked if it\u2019s fun or a challenge to be a first-time filmmaker with that name, she said, \u201cI guess it\u2019s a little bit of both. There\u2019s definitely more pressure, from an outside perspective. But within my family it\u2019s fun.

I told her she didn\u2019t have to use all of them, just to pick the ones she wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames took me through the adaptation process, step by step,\u201d said Coppola. \u201cI picked the stories that I connected with the most, and then did separate screenplays.\u201d\n\nNow it was Franco\u2019s turn to interrupt her.\n\n\u201cGia\u2019s the one who really unified the stories and wove the different strands together,\u201d he said.\n\nFranco grew up in Palo Alto, and freely admits that there\u2019s more than a hint of autobiography in both the book and the film.\n\n\u201cYeah, Teddy, the character played by Jack Kilmer, is probably closest to me as far as what he\u2019s dealing with and his involvement in art classes and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Nat Wolff\u2019s character, Fred . . . there\u2019s nobody in my past that he\u2019s really based on, so I think I realized that he was sort of another side of myself, the darker side of myself.

        "text": "Art, commerce and the internet may seem to have little in common but Hewlett-Packard is challenging expectations with a multimedia initiative spanning virtual and traditional media to woo the so-called \"iMac generation\". The computer giant has turned arts patron by opening a gallery in London's East End and online, and it's using the latest new media tools to spread the word.\n\nAs part of an initiative bluntly titled Hype, HP is inviting anyone to submit original, computer-generated art to be shown at a renovated brewery-turned-art gallery in Brick Lane. The idea is that artists turn up with an digital picture or short film on disc which will then be printed and hung or projected on to the gallery's walls. The catch? While \"art\" can be on any theme - so long as it's legal - to qualify for display every piece must somehow feature the letters H and P (and in that order). Once the walls are full - and for those not able to pop down to Brick Lane - work is also exhibited in a virtual art gallery online.\n\nAptly, Hype has been created by HP's advertising agency, Publicis, but don't call this advertising, says Mark Ellis, HP's business manager, who has overseen the project. Hype is a \"platform for the designers of tomorrow\", he explains, \"ensuring their work is acknowledged by their peers across the artistic and commercial worlds\".\n\nThe hype around Hype began nine months ago when a viral marketing campaign infiltrated more than 120 design-related internet sites, communities, weblogs and discussion forums.\n\nInformation packs and promotional materials were then distributed via a tie-up with the National Union of Students and at various art colleges. Underground events were also staged, such as an \"underground film night\" in a central London car park at which a series of specially commissioned short films were screened. A number of these films were commissioned by Publicis to encapsulate the Hype theme; others were selected from work already contributed by aspiring filmmakers in response to the awareness campaign. More advertising was then created to run in style and fashion magazines; Publicis worked with young, unknown artists who came up with the content.\n\nThe hypegallery.com website has played a central role in establishing the Hype brand, however. Initially, its role was to lead visitors through a virtual journey via sounds, images and film to explain the idea and explain to potential contributors how to get involved. The site was also designed, however, to enable contributors to submit work to Hype from anywhere in the world. Then, last month, hypegallery.com was transformed into a virtual art gallery as it began to showcase contributors' art.\n\nHP's strategy is intriguing. For a start, it represents what Publicis claims is \"significant expenditure\" by a global advertiser, on a campaign which includes no TV ads. What began with online viral advertising has led to HP establishing a database of target consumers whom it hopes to exploit. And it marks what is claimed to be the first UK use of \"hypertags\" - which enable posters to send information to the mobile phones of passers-by.\n\n\"HP wanted to position itself more at the forefront for the next generation of artists, filmmakers and photographers - a very sophisticated generation which is also highly cynical about advertising,\" says Chris Aldous, creative director at Publicis. \"So conventional advertising would not have worked; it just wouldn't have said anything different, interesting or relevant for these people.\"\n\nSimply sponsoring something wouldn't have been good enough, either. \"They needed to engage with their target audience and knew they could do so by encouraging a form of transaction: what young artists want most is exposure,\" he adds.\n\n\"The idea was that HP could provide that platform, and that it would do so in a far more effective way than your ordinary student show - by detailing the artist and their email contact details alongside every piece of art. This meant the website had to be as important as the physical gallery space, and it provided a way for them to set up their own online creative community.\"\n\nThe incentive for artists to participate is to have their work exhibited, to have their details publicised and then have both presented to leading figures in Britain's creative industries at an end of show bash when the Brick Lane space closes on February 19. Their work will live on, however, in the virtual gallery which, Publicis hopes, will become an enduring resource for creative agencies, publishers and commissioning editors.\n\nTo appeal to such a discerning audience, all forms of communication used by HP and Publicis had to be true to the Hype ethos, says Jon Williams, interactive creative director of Publicis' interactive division, Publicis Dialog. Which is why the agency was keen to incorporate hypertag technology. This involves an infra-red transmitter being embedded in posters. The poster requests passers-by to point their mobile phone at it and turn on the infra-red on their handset. The poster's transmitter then implants a calendar entry into the mobile phone's memory to remind the user to visit the gallery in Brick Lane.\n\nIn the campaign's initial stages Publicis worked with viral advertising specialist Cake to build awareness of Hype on the internet - a potentially high risk strategy. \"You can't just drop into a newsgroup and start butting in talking about your brand,\" Williams says. \"You have to get to know the community first, then pick your moment. You have to be engaging, and you have to offer something in return.\" The slow build of the Hype campaign over a number of months shows \"how online values can have a fundamental impact on multimedia advertising campaigns\", he claims.\n\nThe effectiveness of all this, however, is less easily demonstrated. The website has received just under 2.5m hits since it went live early last month and more than 1,200 pieces of original artwork have been submitted; 900 pieces of art are displayed via the website. Meanwhile the Brick Lane gallery, with hanging space for 380 pieces, is full and earlier submissions are being moved to the online gallery to make way for new ones. But it's too early to gauge how commercially valuable HP's new-found friends among Britain's young artists will be.\n\nDespite this, HP is considering extending Hype to Berlin, Barcelona and Paris.",

The well-known actress, upping her relevance in the entrepreneurial arena, revealed this morning that she has hired Lisa Gersh, the former CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia MSO , to be the new CEO of Goop.\n\nGersh, a savvy media-industry executive with well over a decade of startup experience, left Stewart\u2019s company early last year, after just six months at the helm, over disagreements with the veteran lifestyle guru about how to expand her business. At Goop, she\u2019ll apply her strategic thinking about marrying content and commerce toward helping Paltrow compete with Stewart and build her own global lifestyle brand.\n\nGersh, who is attending the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit with Paltrow in Laguna Niguel, California, this week, says she was drawn to what she sees as a triple play: the ability to marry digital content, commerce and advertising. \u201cI love businesses with three revenue streams,\u201d she says. (Watch Paltrow live on stage at the Summit, talking about Goop and Gersh at 7 p.m. EST Tuesday on Fortune.com.)\n\nGoop has been focused on content\u2013from wardrobe to wellness to travel tips, curated by Paltrow and her dozen employees\u2013and has so far generated little revenue. Gersh says that she and Paltrow intend to start bringing in advertising in the first quarter of 2015; they also plan to sell Goop-branded goods as well as other products developed in partnership with established designers. This past summer, Goop collaborated with Diane von Furstenberg on several pieces, including two dresses and a jumpsuit that were sold exclusively on Goop.com.\n\nGersh says Goop has opportunities to grow in many areas, including beauty and home as well as apparel. \u201cGoop crosses a bunch of different categories,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re deciding where to go first.\u201d\n\nAppropriately for a lifestyle partnership-in-the-making, Paltrow offered Gersh the Goop CEO job over a home-cooked dinner in early June. \u201cGwyneth invited me over to her house in LA for dinner, which she pulled off effortlessly,\u201d says Gersh. Over \u201can amazing chicken stir-fry\u201d and salmon with hoisin sauce, the two women brainstormed what Goop\u2019s future might look like with Gersh at the helm. (At one point, they were \u201cappropriately interrupted by a call for homework help\u201d from Paltrow\u2019s two grade school-aged children, Gersh recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s real life.\u201d)\n\nPaltrow started Goop in 2008 in London, where she lived with her husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. The couple split (or more famously, \u201cconsciously uncoupled\u201d) last March; three months later Paltrow moved Goop to Los Angeles and realized she needed to hire a U.S.-based CEO. Paltrow and Gersh met, actually, through another lifestyle entrepreneur, fitness guru Tracy Anderson, last year. Following her exit from Martha Stewart, Gersh was helping Anderson find a CEO for her business; she and Paltrow, who is a friend of Anderson and an aficionado of her intense exercise regimens, bonded over being \u201ctwo entrepreneurial working moms,\u201d Gersh says.\n\nWhile their lifestyles now may seem to be in sync, Paltrow and Gersh started out completely different. Paltrow, 42, was raised in Manhattan by her renowned actor parents, Blythe Danner and the late Bruce Paltrow, and attended the tony Spence school. Gersh, 55, grew up in the Bronx, where her dad owned a fabric and needlepoint store and struggled to make ends meet. Gersh went to public school and put herself through college\u2014SUNY Binghamton\u2014and law school at Rutgers.\n\nA challenging childhood\u2014working since she was 12 years old\u2014instilled in Gersh a fierce ambition to succeed. She co-founded Oxygen Media with Geraldine Laybourne in 1998 and served as president and COO there until NBC Universal bought the company in 2007. She stayed on at NBCU as president of strategic initiatives for three years until Martha came calling.\n\nGersh\u2019s drive isn\u2019t limited to her business career. In September, she won the Liberty National golf club championship near her home in New Jersey. (She has a 10.2 handicap.) And like Paltrow, she\u2019s a Tracy Anderson fanatic\u2014she does the exercise regimen four days a week. Which makes you wonder, could Goop have big ambitions in the exercise business? That would be a good bet.",

Spain raised its 2013 GDP estimate by \u20ac26.2 billion (about $33.6 billion) to \u20ac1.05 trillion, a 2.5% boost.\n\nWhat\u2019s contributing to this good news? Illegal activities. Spaniards apparently consume \u20ac5.4 billion in illegal drugs and spend \u20ac3.8 billion on prostitutes, accounting for 0.87% of GDP.\n\nThe Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE), Spain\u2019s national statistics bureau, did not add illegal activities just for fun, however. As part of new EU regulations, member countries have to include the measurements. There are obvious motives for doing this. On a cynical level, using illegal activities to boost GDP could help some countries stay under deficit-to-GDP ratios mandated by the EU.\n\nOn a scientific level, measuring illegal activity allows for apples-to-apples comparisons between countries where drug use and prostitution are legal (and already measured) and others where they are not.\n\n\u201cIf you want to compare EU countries, it makes sense to harmonize the way you measure the size of the economies,\u201d says Diane Coyle, an economics professor at the University of Manchester in the U.K. and the author of GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History.\n\nAccording to the new measurements, the GDP share of illegal activities was 1% in Italy, 0.7% in U.K., and 0.4% and 0.2% in Portugal and Germany respectively.\n\nBut how accurate can these figures possibly be? The mere fact that the activities are illegal, or at least not legally registered, makes measuring them difficult to say the least.\n\nAndrew Oswald, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick, says that because of measurement difficulties, estimates of the illegal economy are likely off by at least 20-25%. \u201cPeople breaking the law don\u2019t often send in forms to the government.\u201d\n\nSo how do national statistics agencies estimate the market value of illegal activities? To put it simply, they extrapolate from what little data they have.\n\nTake Spain, where prostitution is something of a \u201csemi-legal\u201d activity. On the edges of most Spanish cities, one can find alterne clubs frequented by prostitutes and their customers. The clubs sell drinks and rent rooms, economic activities that can be measured, but the prostitutes are not registered and they don\u2019t report the income they earn in those rented rooms.\n\nSo in late 2013, statisticians from the INE contacted ANELA, a Valencia-based trade association for alterne clubs. The statisticians asked the association to estimate the average price for a visit to a prostitute; the number of services given per day; and the average rent collected per prostitute/day by alterne clubs for the years 2002, 2007, and 2012.\n\nAfter realizing that the questions weren\u2019t a joke, ANELA Marketing Director Jos\u00e9 Roca says for the three years he answered \u20ac50/\u20ac70/\u20ac40 per service to the first question, 6/8/4 times/day to the second. To the third, he answered a flat \u20ac50.\n\nBut those numbers were estimates at best, he says, and any GDP figures developed based on them would be inaccurate. \u201cIt\u2019s an approximation,\u201d he says of the INE\u2019s figures. \u201cYou can\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives at Hetaira, a Madrid nonprofit that works to protect the rights of sex workers, were similarly dubious when INE asked them for help estimating the number of prostitutes working in Spain.\n\n\u201cWe have only numbers of people who we help [about 1,000 per year]. It\u2019s very difficult to know how many people are involved because there is no registry,\u201d says Mari Carmen Fern\u00e1ndez, a social worker at Hetaira. \u201cWhat seemed surprising to us is that they use these numbers for the GDP, but they are not recognizing the rights of people who work in the industry.\u201d\n\nThe accuracy of GDP estimates for illegal economic activity will improve over time, and even more so if and when those activities are made legal and taxed. But for some economists, that may be missing the point.\n\nAlong with Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, the University of Warwick\u2019s Andrew Oswald is part of a school of economic thinkers who believe that GDP is an outdated measurement and that countries should instead measure the psychological wellbeing, or happiness, of their citizens.\n\n\u201cGDP served its purpose well. But modern life is different. The problem is not a lack of food,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the physical wants across Western Europe are essentially satisfied, so mental wellbeing is the criteria.\u201d\n\nHow prostitution and drugs contribute to that measurement is another question entirely.",

        "text": "\u201cI have a perfect wife, a daughter whom I love, a beautiful home, success at work,\u201d says Julien, the woe-begone adulterer in Mathieu Amalric\u2019s adaptation of Georges Simenon\u2019s 1964 novel, \u201cThe Blue Room.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has been paying attention to the battering that supposedly happy marriages have been taking on the screen lately will recognize that this is a formula for disaster. Amalric, who also plays Julien with a gnomish gloom, gussies up this seeming retread of \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and \u201cThe Postman Always Rings Twice\u201d with stylish visuals, a somber pace, a melodramatic soundtrack, and a narrative obliqueness that suggests depths that may or may not exist. Though engrossing and aesthetically admirable, at times the humorless artiness verges on absurdity. It\u2019s hard to take a film too seriously when plum jam and Bach\u2019s \u201cChaconne\u201d vie for equal cinematic significance.\n\nThe title refers to the rented room in which Julien and Esther (St\u00e9phanie Cl\u00e9au, who co-wrote the screenplay with Amalric) take time off from their spouses for languorous, graphic, and sumptuously photographed sex. It can also get a little rough, as Esther bites a chunk off Julien\u2019s lip at one point. Perhaps he should see this as a warning that the wages of sin are more than just the cost of a room in a no-tell hotel. For now, though, the only problem is explaining the wound to his wife, Delphine (L\u00e9a Drucker); but she\u2019s pallid and docile and doesn\u2019t ask questions. Only his spunky daughter asks why, and he offers the typical bumped-into-a-post excuse.\n\nThe questions get a lot tougher after Julien is incarcerated and interrogated for an undisclosed crime. The details emerge gradually over the film\u2019s slow-moving hour and a quarter, with Amalric inserting flashbacks as Julien undergoes grilling by a magistrate who doesn\u2019t mind violating some of the basic rules of judicial procedure, at least as seen on American TV shows. Maybe courts operate differently in France, or the defense lawyers are lousier. Be that as it may, the mystery is pieced together not so much as a who-done-what but as an existential dialectic on ennui.\n\nLess obscure is Amalric\u2019s obsession with the color in the title \u2014 it is more a film bleu than a film noir.

        "text": "Meghan Trainor\u2019s \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d was a breath of fresh air, as long as you didn\u2019t think too hard about it. Dropped into a competitive Top 40 battleground trying its best to figure out how to incorporate dubstep and EDM, a body-positive call to arms wrapped up in girl-group duds with a hip-hop sheen stood out if only by sheer chutzpah alone. That Trainor\u2019s attitudes were as judgmental and dismissive as the ones that she was embraced for as an antidote to (albeit aimed in a novel direction) was immaterial. On pop radio, hooks can forgive just about anything, and \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d had them.\n\nFor better or for worse, \u201cTitle,\u201d Trainor\u2019s full-length debut, is more of the same. (In more ways than one, as it includes all four songs previously released as Trainor\u2019s preceding EP, also called \u201cTitle.\u201d) The Massachusetts-raised Nashville transplant doesn\u2019t always know quite what she\u2019s trying to say or how to say it, but she figures that she can sell it with little more than a smirk and a giddy bounce. In \u201cWalkashame,\u201d she expresses embarrassment at stumbling home the morning after, and then gets righteously indignant at the suggestion that she might have something to be embarrassed about. The sexual politics in \u201cDear Future Husband\u201d are a sitcom nightmare, demanding apologies after they fight even when she admits she\u2019s wrong, and dangling sex as an incentive.\n\nTrouble is, it\u2019s all just so infernally catchy. Of course, in the case of \u201cDear Future Husband,\u201d it\u2019s because she\u2019s simply stripped the lyrics from \u201cRunaround Sue\u201d \u2014 which admittedly had their own sexist streak \u2014 and pilfered the song\u2019s romping backbone seemingly whole, right down to the backing vocals and honking sax. But that\u2019s Trainor\u2019s gift and curse: She\u2019s a plunderer first and foremost. Built on not much more than a simple, percussive rhythm, \u201cBang Dem Sticks\u201d is more or less a rewrite of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d with a horn line that directly echoes Sheeran\u2019s vocal hook. She even steals from herself with \u201cLips Are Movin,\u201d which follows the formula of \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d to a tee, straight-up referencing her earlier hit at one point.\n\n\u201c3am,\u201d meanwhile, finds Trainor aping Katy Perry, in that it finds her aping Sara Bareilles. But instead of delivering a self-esteem anthem like \u201cRoar\u201d (or a someone else\u2019s esteem anthem like \u201cBrave\u201d), Trainor\u2019s song is quieter and more vulnerable, racked with self-doubt that can\u2019t just be sung away with a good pep talk in the mirror. When she steps away from pastiche, she struggles; John Legend comes through loud and clear on boilerplate ballad \u201cLike I\u2019m Gonna Lose You,\u201d while she could be anybody at all. At this stage in her young career, Trainor has sass and infectiousness, but it\u2019s all secondhand. And it\u2019s not the same as personality.

        "text": "For this latest iteration of \u201cExposure,\u201d the Photographic Resource Center at Boston University\u2019s annual juried exhibition, 194 photographers submitted work. Guest curator Kristen Gresh, of the Museum of Fine Arts, selected 13. Thirty-six of their photographs are on display. The show runs through July 26.\n\nMost are in color. A lot are big. Beyond that, the pictures are \u2014 happily \u2014 all over the map: from Boston and Somerville to Lebanon and Libya. Subjects include handsomely displayed handguns, quadrupeds of a certain age, Baltimore row houses, and expired photographic paper.\n\nOne of the pleasures of \u201cExposure\u201d is seeing connections emerge and multiply. Some connections are obvious. Keiko Hiromi\u2019s pair of vibrant photographs of Liberians share a continent with Kyle Meyer\u2019s pair of photographs from Swaziland. Come to think of it, they share the same continent (if little else) with Matthew Arnold\u2019s two large images from the Libyan desert of still-standing pillboxes and barbed wire from World War II. They recall Richard Misrach\u2019s desert photographs, only with an additional sense, sad and sere, of history\u2019s weight. Arnold calls his series \u201cTopography is Fate.\u201d These pictures suggest a further, grimmer title: \u201cWar is Enduring.\u201d\n\nMeyer\u2019s portraits of gay men in Swaziland are highly distinctive. He weaves wax print fabric into the digital print, making the resulting image almost abstract. More important, doing so conceals the identity of the sitter, since homosexuality is illegal in Swaziland. The intersection of danger and pattern recurs in the three examples here from Yorgos Efthymiadis\u2019s series \u201cDomesticated.\u201d Efthymiadis photographs guns against a background of carpet or brocade. It\u2019s easy to overlook the weapon until you see it \u2014 and then that becomes impossible.\n\nFor reasons thematic rather than formal, Meyer\u2019s pictures obviously relate to Zoe Perry-Wood\u2019s three portraits of attendees at the Boston Alliance of Gay & Lesbian Youth Prom. Their candid, forthright gaze is worlds away from the hidden faces of the men in Swaziland.\n\nThe issue of presentation informs Efthymiadis, Meyer, and Perry-Wood\u2019s work. So, too, with Susan Barnett\u2019s half-dozen pictures of T-shirt wearers seen from behind (what we wear is who we are?), and Rhea Karam\u2019s pair of pictures of wall murals and signs in the Middle East. In \u201cRed Cars,\u201d the title refers to what we see in the foreground. Behind the vehicles are a set of recurring images of political leaders and behind those images a flag and intriguing architectural space. The play of picture planes is arresting, even a bit unsettling, an effect abetted by the jagged line between shadow and light visible on a blank wall.\n\nTo be sure, the interplay of light and shadow underlies all photography. It\u2019s front and center in Dean Kessmann\u2019s \u201cTest Strips.\u201d These effectively abstract images are photograms, rendering incremental progressions from black to white or the reverse. If Morris Louis had abandoned his Stripe paintings for photography, the results might have looked like this.\n\nThe nature of photography, in this case its materiality, also draws David Wolf. He gets striking results from using expired photographic paper for his prints. Far from festive is the glum tree shown in the 15 small gridded images of \u201cBlue Christmas No. 1.\u201d\n\nUpended expectations and a sense of place define Ben Marcin\u2019s photographs of Baltimore row houses and Debi Cornwall\u2019s of leisure-time spaces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Marcin\u2019s boarded-up buildings sitting alone on a bleak lot have a proud, stalwart verticality that Wolf\u2019s forlorn tree could learn a lot from. As for Cornwall\u2019s four photographs from Gitmo, they are no less contradictory. In \u201cSmoke Break, Camp America,\u201d we see three Marines looking toward a sun-splashed Caribbean. The open water is a grim joke on the confinement \u2014 geopolitical, penal, moral \u2014 situated behind the photographer.\n\nThe most charming connection is arranged. Edie Bresler\u2019s trio of photographs of stores that sell lottery tickets are overflowing slices of everyday American life. Just how overflowing is apparent in \u201cAmar (Somerville, Massachusetts).\u201d This is one busy image, abounding in shapes and colors and logos. Yet what draws the eye is the surpassing sweetness of the gaze Amar directs at the camera. His lovable look matches up with the facing photograph across the gallery, of Bogart, a Santa Cruz sheep, photographed by Isa Leshko. Few connections are better than this: two pairs of friendly, fond eyes meeting across a room. The fact that the eyes are two-dimensional and belong to different species hardly matters.\n\n19th Annual PRC Juried Exhibition\n\n832 Commonwealth Ave., through July 26, 617-975-0600, www.bu.edu/prc",

        "text": "Warren Buffett likes to say that you only find out who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out. With earnings season looming, investors also should be careful with companies that appear fully clothed.\n\nThe first quarter was another tough one. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate earnings for S&P 500 companies fell by 7.5% from a year earlier. It is the kind of environment in which the shares of companies that are able to keep notching good results are richly rewarded.\n\nThe trouble is those rewards can also tempt companies to overstep the bounds for fear of swift punishment.\n\nFor a recent project, Patricia Dechow, an accounting professor at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, and three co-authors screened for nonfinancial firms that were subject to enforcement actions for misstating earnings at some point between 1994 and 2010. They then looked at how their earnings compared with analyst estimates during the misstatement period.\n\nTheir finding: 53% of misstating firms topped estimates for at least four consecutive quarters versus 43% for other firms. That is significant.\n\nFor an example of a company that, until recently, was racking up impressive earnings stats, investors need look no further than Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. VRX 1.76 % In the five years that ended in last year\u2019s third quarter, it topped analysts\u2019 median estimates 18 times and met them twice. The streak ended last month when Valeant finally released unaudited fourth-quarter results that fell short of estimates.\n\nNow, doubts are swirling over Valeant\u2019s past results. It has said that it wrongly booked $58 million in revenue in 2014, that it is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that it is unsure when it will file audited 2015 financials. Its stock is nearly 90% below its peak in August.\n\nWhile the book isn\u2019t yet closed on what happened at Valeant, investors should consider if estimate-beating results weren\u2019t actually a warning sign.\n\nAs they ponder that, investors should consider a broader question: What leads a company to game earnings? One theory is greed: Management wants to push the stock higher. Another theory says it is fear: Management is worried about seeing the stock tank.\n\nIt looks like fear plays the greater role. The researchers found that forward price/earnings multiples for companies with strings of earnings beats that fell afoul of the SEC were elevated before the period when they misstated earnings. During the misstatement period, valuations tended to stay rich, but not get any richer.\n\nSo the probable explanation is that companies generally got rewarded with P/E ratios on a run of good results, but weren\u2019t able to keep delivering. For managers who had been enjoying the fruits of a high valuation, this was hard to take.\n\nAn especially big worry: Shares of companies with a history of positive earnings surprises tend to get severely punished after misses. So that raises the stakes for these companies.\n\nAnd those are particularly high today when overall U.S. profits have been flagging after a long period of growth\u2014the tide is going out. Before rewarding a company that seemingly has avoided the earnings slowdown, investors need to be sure it isn\u2019t just wearing the emperor\u2019s new swimming suit.",

        "text": "I generally despise first-person car reviews. Particularly when the vehicle in question is expensive, or fast, or both, these stories can quickly devolve into oily billets-doux of the writer\u2019s preternatural giftedness behind the wheel. Or, worse, they become obnoxiously self-deprecating confessionals of their doubtful worthiness in the face of such blinding automotive majesty. So it is with no small amount of consternation that, after stewing over the Aston Martin DB11 for weeks after driving the car, I have decided to approach my take on it from the shameless first-person perspective.\n\nThe DB11 costs \u00a3154,900 in the UK ($211,995 in the US) and there is nothing sensible about spending that much on a car, and very little point in making sensible comparisons with other such moments of conspicuous consumption \u2014 fuel efficiency and cargo capacity and such. For a buyer with the means and the motivation, there is nothing I could possibly write that will dampen enthusiasm for the DB11, short of revealing that it was assembled by gruel-fed orphans in a Dickensian workhouse. And even that, for some, would merely add to its Anglo-mystique.\n\nCandidly, I find it difficult to contain my open admiration for the car, which is poor motoring journalism, at best. I am inordinately fond of it, all of it, and that makes presenting a balanced, consumer-serving review really tough. This is not a vehicle that inspires cross-shopping or Top Trumps-style stats-mashing, except by fantasy-garage types who either can\u2019t afford the car or aren\u2019t old enough to drive it. With deference to James Bond, who for 50-odd years has employed Aston Martins as work vehicles, these are not cars designed to serve any real purpose beyond pleasure. \u201cFor the love of beautiful\u201d is a phrase evoked more than once by Aston\u2019s head of design, Marek Reichman, during my time with the DB11 and the Gaydon entourage (in Tuscany, if you must know). It\u2019s a phrase that guided the creation of the car \u2014 all of it, not just the exposed bits. And it shows.\n\nI pause now to ask: When did Aston Martins become beautiful? The first DB model, the DB2 of 1950, was lovely, but lovely in a tweedy-jaunty sort of way, rather than a sexy-wow sort of way. Older Aston Martins merit a good many adjectives \u2014 words like \u201cpure\u201d (1963 DB5), \u201cmasculine\u201d (1972 AMV8) \u201cstartling\u201d (1974 Lagonda), and even \u201cpreposterous\u201d (2011 Cygnet). But beautiful? Harder to justify. The singular 1960 DB4GT Bertone \u201cJet\u201d was beautiful, no doubt, but it took an Italian design house and a young designer named Giorgetto Giugiaro to make it so.\n\nWe aspire to make the most beautiful cars in the world.\n\nThe DB11 is beautiful \u2014 straight-up, sexy-wow beautiful. To these first-person eyes it is the most beautiful production car on the planet right now, surpassing in overall comeliness even the candy-sweet Aston Martin Vanquish, which honourably concludes its four-year stint as The Most Beautiful Car on the Planet According to Me. And this is not mere happenstance. Aston Martin has a plan.\n\nSaid the company\u2019s chief executive, Andy Palmer: \u201cWe aspire to make the most beautiful cars in the world.\u201d Full stop. They put it in the press release, third paragraph. \u201cWe aspire to make the most beautiful cars in the world.\u201d He did not say the fastest cars in the world, or the most futuristic cars in the world, or, heaven forbid, the most fuel-efficient cars in the world. He said the most beautiful. And that\u2019s what he is doing. For the love of beautiful.\n\nMuch has been made of the differences between the old DB9 and the new DB11. (The DB10, for the uninitiated, was a bespoke concept car created in 2014 as a work vehicle for a certain British secret agent). The structure of the DB11 is 15% stiffer than the DB9\u2019s, for instance, and its engine weighs 10 pounds less. Its wheelbase is 65 millimetres longer and fuel-consumption is down by 20%. It\u2019s all academic, really. This is an entirely new car, created with an entirely new mindset. \u201cEvery millimetre of the DB11 has been re-imagined from the ground-up,\u201d said Reichman. A DB9 on hand during the DB11 launch event looked like an orthopaedic loafer next to a Nike Air Max trainer. And the DB9 is a very handsome car. The DB11 is just that much more sexy-wow.\n\nUp front, the clamshell bonnet is a sculptural masterwork \u2014 claimed to be the largest single piece of pressed aluminium ever affixed to a car. There are no unsightly shut lines on the upper plane of the bonnet, only fine creases and two pairs of slender, functional vents. Behind the front wheels, the bonnet\u2019s edges meet side strakes that relieve air pressure within the wheel wells to keep the tyres planted at speed.\n\nMoving rearward, the arc of body work that extends from the A- to C-pillars is no mere stamping. Notes Aston: \u201cThis incredibly labour-intensive component, which is first extruded, then stretch-bent, then pressed, then laser cut, then polished and finally anodised to achieve the complex shape and flawless finish its design demands.\u201d And this leads the eye to another bit of high-tech frippery. The roof strakes form the edges of intakes at the C-pillars, which channel air through internal ducts and up through slots on the top edge of the boot lid.\n\nThis feature has a trademarked name, of course, AeroBlade, and it serves as a \u2018virtual spoiler\u2019, creating a wall of high-pressure air that obstructs airflow over the top of the car, reducing lift and allowing the rear wheels to go about their business more effectively. At higher speeds, a small non-virtual spoiler extends upward in front of the slots, allowing wall of air to flair a little higher. Aston Martin insists the AeroBlade works, but it\u2019s a little like the GPS-guided transmission in the Rolls-Royce Wraith. You can\u2019t feel it working, but you can\u2019t feel it not working, either. No matter: Like so much of the DB11, it will provide owners with some first-rate cocktail conversation.\n\nSpeed will be another talking point, of course, and the DB11 is very fast \u2014 much more so than the DB9 it replaces. The engine is new: a 5.2-litre V12 with two turbochargers that produces 600 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. Aston claims the car will bolt from zero to 62mph in 3.9 seconds and press on to a top speed of 200mph. The engine is paired with an eight-speed automatic from German transmission-maker ZF Friedrichshafen. It has cool-to-the-touch metal shifter paddles behind the steering wheel for those who crave control, but really, I reckon the transmission is better at the task of gear-selecting than you. Certainly better than me.\n\nFully kitted, the cabin makes a powerful impression: Swathed in yards and yards of pinked and perforated hide, it\u2019s like sitting in a big Ghillie Brogue. The DB11\u2019s infotainment package is an eon beyond that of its predecessor, thanks to a technology transfusion from Mercedes-Benz (whose parent, Daimler, owns 5% of Aston Martin). The DB9\u2019s Emotion Control Unit, or ECU \u2014 a hefty glass \u201ckey\u201d that plugged into a slot on the centre console \u2014 has been consigned to history, replaced by a somewhat less fanciful start/stop button. My heart goes out to Aston dealers, whose profitability likely hinged on selling replacements for lost ECUs at \u00a3900 apiece.\n\nThe DB11 leads Aston\u2019s \u201cSecond Century\u201d plan, which, says Palmer, calls for the introduction of seven new models over seven years, including a replacement for the Vantage sports car and a proper supercar successor to the Vanquish. There will be a production version of the DBX electric off-roader concept from 2015, as well, though it will have a more traditional SUV profile and a more traditional powerplant. And, of course, there will be the mad AM-RB 001 hypercar, a labour of love for Reichman and the Red Bull Racing F1 team\u2019s chief technical officer, Adrian Newey.\n\nThese are heady times for a company that in the early 1980s was struggling to sell three cars per week. And yet, Aston Martin is hardly a cash cow: In June, the 103-year-old company reported a 2015 loss of close to \u00a3128m, its fifth straight year of unprofitability. But the DB11 manages to belie its maker\u2019s tough times. The deftness of its design and the soundness of its execution makes Andy Palmer\u2019s big plans for the future seem much easier to believe. If the former Coolest Brand in Britain can the maintain the momentum \u2014 across seven cars in seven years \u2014 we foresee happy days ahead in Gaydon.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this or anything else you have seen on BBC Autos, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "text": "A state health care watchdog agency on Tuesday warned that medical costs in Massachusetts are likely to rise if Boston Children\u2019s Hospital moves ahead with a controversial $1 billion expansion plan.\n\nThe Health Policy Commission cannot block the project, but its views will be considered by the state Department of Public Health, which has the final say. The commission\u2019s warning comes on top of opposition from competing hospitals and activist groups and may complicate the chances of swift approval for facilities that Children\u2019s says are urgently needed.\n\nThe commission found that adding beds and outpatient facilities at Children\u2019s would be likely to draw patients from other Massachusetts health care providers, increasing spending by an estimated $8.5 million to $18.1 million a year for patients on commercial health insurance. That\u2019s because Children\u2019s has among the highest hospital prices in the state, the commission said.\n\nThe commission routinely studies hospital mergers, but this is the first time it has raised concerns about a hospital\u2019s campus expansion project. Children\u2019s strongly objected to the commission\u2019s comments.\n\nCommission chairman Stuart Altman said a bigger Children\u2019s could eventually threaten to put other pediatric hospitals out of business. Children\u2019s competes with MassGeneral Hospital for Children, Tufts Medical Center\u2019s Floating Hospital for Children, and others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the business of picking winners and losers,\u201d Altman said of the commission. \u201cI believe in markets . . . but we can\u2019t rule out the implication that that would have on cost.\u201d\n\nThe commission voted to send its objections in a seven-page letter to the Department of Public Health. The Children\u2019s project is the biggest capital expense ever to come before public health officials. The department has been reviewing the plans for months, and a decision is expected in October.\n\nChildren\u2019s, which has 404 beds, is the dominant pediatric hospital in Massachusetts and one of the largest in the country, with 46 percent of the statewide market for pediatric patients who have commercial insurance. It wants to construct an 11-story building and add 71 beds to its Longwood Medical Area campus and build an eight-story outpatient center in Brookline.\n\nThe expansion has the potential to boost Children\u2019s share of the pediatric market.\n\nThe new facility at Children\u2019s would eliminate the Prouty Garden (above).\n\nIn disputing the commission\u2019s analysis, hospital officials said they are taking aggressive steps to control costs. They note that a recent consultant\u2019s report \u2014 required by public health officials \u2014 confirmed the expansion project would be consistent with the state\u2019s goals for containing health care costs.\n\n\u201cThe data used by HPC is flawed, misleading, and speculative,\u201d Children\u2019s spokesman Rob Graham said in a statement. \u201cEven if HPC\u2019s worst-case scenario plays out, the cost impact would equal a 0.033% increase in costs to Massachusetts consumers per HPC math.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s says it needs the new beds to accommodate a growing and increasingly complex patient population.\n\nThe recent analysis from Navigant Consulting, which analyzed data provided by Children\u2019s, said the project would not increase health spending in Massachusetts because all the patient growth is expected to come from other states and countries.\n\nBut Altman questioned those projections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable, but very unlikely\u201d that Children\u2019s would be able to fill new beds without taking a greater share of local patients, he said.\n\nThe commission is charged with studying and commenting on the health care market but does not have regulatory powers. Its analyses have had an impact in the past, however. After the panel raised cost concerns about Partners HealthCare\u2019s bid to acquire three community hospitals, a state judge last year rejected an agreement that would have allowed those deals, citing the commission\u2019s studies in her decision.\n\nInitially, commissioners were not unified on what to say about the Children\u2019s project. They had planned to declare a \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the project would lead to increased medical spending, but after much discussion Tuesday morning \u2014 in public and behind closed doors \u2014 they agreed to soften the language to suggest a \u201clikelihood\u201d of increased spending.\n\nThe project already faces strong opposition from people who are upset that the new hospital building would replace the Prouty Garden, a healing garden cherished by many patients, families, and hospital staff. A group of Prouty Garden supporters is suing the hospital. Leaders of MassGeneral and Tufts also have objected to the project.\n\nOpponents of the Children\u2019s project have been lobbying the commission to get involved in the debate, but Altman said that dispute had \u201cvery little\u201d impact on the commission\u2019s decision to comment.\n\nSharon Torgerson, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, which includes the Department of Public Health, said the department had not received or reviewed the commission\u2019s letter as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cTheir comments, along with others, including the Independent Cost Analysis conducted by Navigant, will become part of the official record,\u201d she said in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cEvaluation of reasonableness and costs are one of the nine factors that guide the . . . process, and has been part of our review over the past several months.\u201d",

Last season appeared to be rock bottom, as the Giants\u2019 quarterback tossed a league-high 27 interceptions, including five in a loss to Seattle.\n\nAnd for all of the Giants\u2019 problems heading into Sunday\u2019s loss to the visiting San Francisco 49ers\u2014season-ending injuries to wideout Victor Cruz and cornerback Prince Amukamara, as well as the league\u2019s lowest-rated defense\u2014Manning was the biggest positive, tossing 17 touchdown passes against just six interceptions.\n\nOn Sunday, when his second career five-pick performance resulted in a 16-10 loss, he was practically the Giants\u2019 only problem. \u201cI\u2019ve got to make better decisions, better throws,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThey\u2019re all on me; it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s fault. I\u2019ve got to protect the ball and can\u2019t afford to turn it over, especially a couple times in field-goal range.\u201d\n\nIn his defense, Manning\u2019s offensive line didn\u2019t play well, particularly after right tackle Justin Pugh went down with quadriceps injury in the first half. And statistically, Manning has had worse games; back in 2004, for one, he registered a 0.0 quarterback rating in a 37-14 loss to Baltimore.\n\nBut until Sunday, when he completed 22 of 45 passes for 280 yards and a 36.6 rating, Manning had never been so toxic.\n\nWhen tight end Larry Donnell\u2019s leaping 30-yard reception put the Giants on San Francisco\u2019s 35-yard line, Manning responded with an interception. When Josh Brown\u2019s onside kick surprised the 49ers and resulted in a Giants\u2019 first down near midfield, Manning responded with an interception. And when Odell Beckham Jr. defied gravity by hauling in a flying 37-yard sideline catch in the fourth quarter, Manning responded with his fifth and costliest pick of the day.\n\nThe potentially game-winning pass to Preston Parker was deflected before falling into the hands of 49ers linebacker Chris Borland. But that fact should not absolve Manning, who tossed three consecutive incompletions from the 4-yard line prior to the turnover.\n\nManning\u2019s first pick, in the second quarter, was a poor read. He was trying squeeze a pass into Beckham before 49ers linebacker Chris Borland jumped the route. On the next drive, Manning saw a looming defender behind receiver Rueben Randle, but let go of the football anyway. \u201cI tried to pull it back and couldn\u2019t pull it back enough and it kind of slipped out and went to the linebacker,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the interceptions. Manning neglected open receivers on several plays, and overthrew others in big spots. He even put running back Rashad Jennings at risk with a check-down pass at the end of the third quarter. Fortunately for the defenseless Jennings, who was playing for the first time since spraining his knee in Week 5, the pass fell incomplete.\n\nThe 49ers deserve some credit for the way they pressured Manning, but his meek response shouldn\u2019t have been a total surprise. Entering Sunday, Manning had completed just 35.6% of his passes when under pressure, ranking him below every qualifying quarterback besides former Jets starter Geno Smith, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously the accuracy issue,\u201d Tom Coughlin said afterward. \u201cHe had great pressure and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to argue with that one.\u201d",

The F-35 program is a critical sales generator for the company, accounting for 20 percent of last year's revenue of $46.1 billion.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email that the company was committed to providing the capability and affordability to meet national security needs.\n\nWhile the F-35 program has been dogged by problems and costs have escalated to an estimated $379 billion, it is significantly newer than the F-18, which does not have the same stealth capabilities.\n\n\"They're two completely different aircraft from different generations,\" said Phillip Carter, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. \"It's like comparing an old jeep to a Humvee.\"\n\nDan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit that investigates government contractors, said the F-35's stealth capabilities drove the cost up, but its usefulness had not yet been demonstrated. He said canceling the program, however, would be \"disruptive.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump touted his negotiating skills as a businessman, and he appears to be using similar tactics as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20. It was not clear how his blunt style would translate to Pentagon procurement or international diplomacy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters there that he had guaranteed costs would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the presidential plane, another project Trump calls too expensive.\n\nLockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson did not speak to reporters but said in a statement that the meeting was \"productive.\" Trump told reporters he wanted to cut the F-35 program's costs.\n\nFor more on Donald Trump's tweets, watch this video:\n\nIf he scrapped the F-35, such a move by a new administration would have some precedent. Then-President Jimmy Carter canceled the B-1 bomber program in June 1977, although it was resurrected by his White House successor, Ronald Reagan.\n\nTrump's jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a hurdle for all U.S. defense contractors in the next administration, Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at financial services firm Cowen & Co, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\n\"We have no idea how this plays out but believe 'Twitter risk' for defense companies could be a significant issue over the next four years,\" Schweizer wrote. \"This is Lockheed Martin's time in the barrel.\"",

Photograph: Rex Features\n\nThe extraordinary works Henri Matisse made during the last period of his life \u2013 the large-scale cut-outs on coloured paper, including his famous Blue Nudes \u2013 are to be exhibited at Tate Modern next spring.\n\nIt will be the most comprehensive exhibition of these late works ever held, with 120 on show, including his Large Composition with Masks from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Memory of Oceania from the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Tate's own The Snail. These works were displayed together by the artist in his studio, and will be seen together again for the first time during the exhibition.\n\nThe artist began to make cut-outs in 1943, according to the curator Nicholas Cullinan, after an operation in his early 70s that left him in ill health and the feeling that he was living on borrowed time. At first the impulse was pure expedience: the works could be made much more quickly than an oil painting. At the same time, \"he began to realise the potential in the method, and stopped painting, choosing to focus on the cut-outs,\" said Cullinan. \"He talked about how liberated he felt; how he had been given a second life.\"\n\nWith assistants colouring the paper to precise specifications and then helping to position the works, Matisse would \"make cut-outs with a rapid gesture with the scissors, incredibly quickly,\" said Cullinan. He was also \"fastidious and meticulous\", redoing and altering the work until it was exactly right.\n\nHe became so entrenched in this way of making art that \"his work rate accelerated rather than diminished \u2013 he would work around the clock and assistants in their 20s remembered being really put through their paces by him. He was still working in 1954, two days before he died.\"\n\nThey were extraordinarily forward-looking works. \"They are more like installations or environments than paintings; and they seem very contemporary now. Part of the point of the show is to reconsider them in this light,\" said Cullinan. \"They were a way of collapsing line and colour; at the same time they were a kind of sculpture \u2013 carving into pure colour.\"\n\nTate Modern's 2014 exhibition lineup will also include shows devoted to two recently departed major figures, Richard Hamilton, the father of British pop art, and the German master Sigmar Polke. There will also be an exhibition devoted to a hugely important figure from the early 20th century, the Russian constructivist Kasimir Malevich.\n\nAt Tate Britain, there will be the first big survey of British folk art, an exhibition devoted to Turner's late period, and an exhibition examining the cultural contribution of the critic and scholar Kenneth Clark. The sculptor Phyllida Barlow, known for her works in inexpensive and low grade materials, has been asked to make new work for the Tate Britain Commission, which invites an artist to develop a new work in response to the Tate collection.\n\nAt Tate Liverpool a show devoted to Mondrian, marking 70 years since his death, will include a reconstruction of his Paris studio.",

He is also known for the extraordinary prices his works realise at auction: his Architect's Home in the Ravine was sold for \u00a37.7m at Christie's auction house this year.\n\nThe exhibition, called No Foreign Lands, will show 120 works made over the past dozen years, including a handful of freshly completed paintings that have never been shown in public before. He continues to draw on his life in Trinidad, where he has lived with his family since 2002, and which, he said, \"continually poses possibilities for painting, in a different way from London or New York. In Trinidad you might see something just on the walk to the studio. It's hard to explain; it's just that kind of place.\"\n\nWhen Doig came to prominence in the 1990s, his figurative painting was somewhat out of kilter with the neo-conceptualism of the Young British Artists (YBA). He became known for pictures suggested by the landscapes of Canada, but with surface patinas and patterning that hinted that he was at least as interested in the formal language of painting as in representing the world he saw.\n\nAccording to Keith Hartley, the curator of the exhibition, \"he is trying to get some kind of balance between something he's seen in reality and can't get out of his mind, and being pulled in a formal direction\".\n\nDoig's work has always defied easy categorisation. \"You can't place him in any fashion or school,\" Hartley said. \"He's not a YBA, he's a free spirit.\"\n\nUnlike the ideas-based works of many of his peers, Doig's paintings are, rather, situated in the world of purely visual thinking. Doig himself said he enjoyed his slightly off-centre world, in dialogue as much with the painters of the past, such as Matisse, Bonnard or Degas, as with his own painter peers.\n\n\"I never minded being a bit on the outside; I liked that painting was marginalised, a bit of a niche activity. I'm not saying it's clandestine, but other people who make paintings: that's who your real audience is,\" he said.\n\nHis work has the \"kind of authority that can't be striven for, but only arrived at like an unexpected gift\", according to the Guardian art critic Adrian Searle.\n\nNo Foreign Lands: Peter Doig is at the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, from 3 August to 3 November.",

Is nobody doing any ambitious social thinking that is not a veil for callous cuts?\n\nStep forward, the Serpentine gallery.

It weaves the memories of people who grew up in east London and have lived on the estate since it opened into a silvery thread of meaning illuminated by dramatisations of their experiences filmed in the aged, but dignified, Woodberry Down buildings and public spaces. The estate, begun in 1946 and completed in 1963, was like a \"palace\" to those who remembered the East End slums, remembers one participant. But the film is also a palace of memory. Contemporary art often seems obsessed with youth: here it listens to the stories the old have to tell.\n\nIt evokes all our stories. Britain in 1945, out of the ruins of war, built the welfare state that clever rich kids are now so casually pulling apart. Estates like Woodberry Down embody an ideal of decent housing for all that was born out of the miseries of the 1930s and terror of the 1940s. A Palace for Us gently and acutely bears witness to this history that is now being dismantled.\n\nHunter's film is not a rant, but a moving homage to lives and memories that today are obliterated by harsh and violent caricatures of the white working class.

The usually slender Gibson had lost even more weight, causing fans to taunt her skeletal appearance online. \"Some were just plain mean and ignorant,\" she says.\n\nThe response inspired Gibson to come clean about a health challenge she has been facing.\n\n\"Last year, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease,\" she writes on her\n\n\"It is an elusive disease that disguises itself as many other things, and creates a lot of pain and discomfort.\"\n\n\"The first symptoms came in the form of food sensitivities,\" she continues. \"I found I could not touch sugar, starch, caffeine, certain oils, etc. without having a severe reaction that felt like electricity running through my body.\"\n\nNext came the nerve pain and muscle fatigue. She wondered if she had mono. According to Gibson, her doctors tested her for \"everything under the sun\" \u2013 except for Lyme disease.\n\nShe continued to worsen. \"I kept eating a ton of protein and fat to try to keep weight on \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 egg yolks, red meat, you name it. But the weight kept falling off and I had a gaunt and sinewy look.\"\n\nShe felt numbness and tingling in her hands and feet, which she says was \"very disconcerting for a pianist and dancer, to say the least.\" The tingling was followed by night sweats, fever, nerve tremors, nightmares and migraines.\n\nHer loved ones were concerned about her weight loss. \"At times, my boyfriend would insist I eat some pasta and butter, even though I did not feel great doing it,\" she says. \" 'You need to gain weight,' he would say. My spine was frail and unprotected.\"\n\nAlarmed by her gaunt appearance, Gibson says she sought Botox to smooth out the deep lines in her forehead. \"Both the trauma of the needles and the toxin itself wreaked havoc on my physical and mental state. I will never put this or any other toxin into my body for vanity reasons again.\"\n\n\"Five days after the treatment, I was texting my boyfriend and he noticed I was mixing up my words. I had trouble with directions and driving. I was terrified.\"\n\nGibson says she finally found a \"Lyme-literate doctor\" who started treating her for the disease. \"I remember sitting in his office, despondent,\" she says. \" 'I am in here somewhere,' I said through tears. By this point, my cognitive thinking had been affected \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 my sense of direction, sleep, moods, stamina, muscles and joints.

As her body has responded to the treatment, Gibson says she's getting back to normal.\n\n\"I actually feel like me again,\" she says. \"We all face challenges and I am learning much from the ones I am facing. No disease in the body can keep the spirit from soaring, the love from pouring, and nothing can stop the music!\"",

        "text": "It was one of the bloodiest days in World War II history that most people have never heard of.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the D-Day invasion, Allied forces conducted a training exercise off the southern coast of England to simulate the landing of large forces on enemy soil. German torpedo boats got wind of the exercise and sank two troop vessels, killing more than 700 soldiers and sailors.\n\nNow an underwater robot from the Massachusetts company whose autonomous submarines have surveyed the wreck of the Titanic and searched for Amelia Earhart\u2019s plane has captured vivid images of the remains of the lost vessels.\n\nIn March, a Remus 100 submarine made by Hydroid Inc. of Pocasset used sonar to find and capture images of the landing craft lost during Exercise Tiger, a simulation of the Allied invasion of Normandy that would take place about a month later. Hydroid carried out the survey at its own expense, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the sinking.\n\nUnderwater robots are in wide use around the world for deep-water surveying, naval surveillance, and oceanographic research. A similar robot made by Bluefin Robotics Inc. of Quincy is being used to search the southern Indian Ocean for traces of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That sub, Bluefin-21, can dive to 15,000 feet, far deeper than the Remus 100 used in the search for the World War II wrecks.\n\nBut a larger model from Hydroid, the Remus 6000, can dive to 20,000 feet. In 2011, three of those were used to find the remains of Air France 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.\n\nThe US National Archives/Exercise Tiger Trust\n\nAllied forces practiced landings on the south coast of England.\n\nThe quest to photograph the two WWII troop carriers was sparked by Graham Lester, a British citizen and a Hydroid vice president. During a vacation last summer, he encountered a seaside memorial in Torcross, England, to those who died in Exercise Tiger.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s scratching his head and going, how come nobody knows about this?\u201d said Hydroid\u2019s Kathy Forrester.\n\nIndeed, Exercise Tiger remained a secret for weeks after the sinking, because the Allied command did not want to give away vital intelligence about its invasion plans.\n\nThe two sunken ships were among a group of eight carrying about 4,000 American support troops, who were to follow up the first wave of the invasion. On April 28, 1944, they had sailed about 30 miles off the southern coast of England, and were to make their practice landing in an area called Slapton Sands, because it resembles one of the Normandy invasion areas called Utah Beach.\n\nBut the German navy picked up radio traffic from the American ships, and ordered in nine torpedo boats. During the ensuing battle, three of the eight landing craft were hit by torpedoes. While one made it back to England, two sank.\n\nIncredibly, the carnage continued as the remaining landing craft reached the beach. British artillery had been ordered to shell the landing zone, to make the training more realistic. But they were supposed to cease fire once the American landing began. They didn\u2019t, and over 200 more Americans died from friendly fire.\n\nIn all, Exercise Tiger took the lives of nearly 1,000 men; the actual landing at Utah Beach resulted in fewer than 200 dead.\n\nAfter visiting the Exercise Tiger memorial, Lester came up with the idea to create images of the lost landing craft. He got the backing of his superiors at Hydroid, which is owned by Kongsberg Maritime of Norway, and the company donated its time and equipment for the search.\n\nBritain\u2019s Royal Navy also offered to help, and conducted a separate survey of the area.\n\nTracking down the lost ships was relatively easy, as the general area of the sinkings was well known. The wrecks lie in about 150 feet of water, within the Remus 100\u2019s relatively shallow diving range of about 300 feet.\n\nThe robot carries high-resolution sonars on either side of its hull, and can sweep the ocean bottom in a back-and-forth, lawn-mower-like pattern to find sunken objects.\n\nMike Mulrooney, a Hydroid senior field service technician, said that once the general location of the ships was pinned down, the Remus 100 could pass fairly close to the wrecks. Hydroid also increased the speed at which its sonar \u201cpinged\u201d the target with sound waves, resulting in sharp, detailed images of the ships.\n\n\u201cThe faster we can ping, the more data points are made across the body of the wreck,\u201d said Mulrooney.\n\nThe images produced by the Hydroid team will be donated to the UK National Archives and to local organizations that maintain memorials to Exercise Tiger. A Hydroid spokeswoman said there are no plans for further exploration of the site.\n\nUnder US and international law, the wreckage of warships sunk in battle remain the property of the nations for which they fought, and are to be treated as grave sites. Such wrecks may not be salvaged without the permission of the nation that owns them.",

Since peaking at US$190 in 2011, iron ore prices have slid more than 70 per cent to about US$50 a ton. This is denting tax revenues, forcing smaller mining companies to close and lay off thousands of employees.\n\n\"Western Australia was the big beneficiary of the China boom,\" says Chris Richardson, economist at Deloitte Access Economics. \"But it is suffering now as the mine construction phase ends and commodity prices fall amid a surge in iron ore supply and faltering demand.\"\n\nRead MoreCiti analysts call the 'end of the Iron Age'\n\nIn 2013 the state lost its triple-A credit rating. On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's warned it may face a further downgrade because of its budget problems.\n\nWestern Australia says that if iron ore prices stay at US$50 per ton it would wipe out A$4 billion (US$3 billion) in projected royalty revenues in 2015-16 \u2014 12 per cent of the state budget.\n\nUnemployment in the state, although still modest at 5.8 per cent, has risen from 3.8 per cent when iron ore prices peaked. House prices have started to fall in the state capital Perth, while they continue to grow in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nMr Barnett wants other states to give Western Australia a greater share of revenues from a nationwide goods and services tax. But so far Canberra and other states have rejected his pleas. On Friday, state premiers will discuss the dispute.\n\nWeak Chinese data are fueling concerns that Western Australia's problems could spread across a country that has avoided recession for two decades by riding China's commodities boom.\n\nMore from The Financial Times:\n\nBernanke chooses hedge fund for first post-Fed job Bund yields hit low as Greek debt plunges Christine Lagarde dashes Greek hopes on loan respite\n\nIron ore is Australia's biggest export, worth A$74 billion in 2013-14, and the plunge in prices is beginning to hurt the federal budget. In December, Canberra revised its budget deficit forecast to A$40 billion, or 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014-15, up from a forecast of A$29.8 billion made in May, citing the impact of a fall in iron ore prices to US$60 per ton.\n\nSince then, prices have continued to fall further and this week Joe Hockey, Australia's treasurer, warned they could fall as low as US$35, costing the exchequer a further A$6.35 billion a year in lost revenues.\n\n\"If iron ore prices stay at about US$45 and export volumes remain at current levels, then Australia should be OK,\" says Warren Hogan, ANZ chief economist. \"But it is a finely balanced situation and if we see the iron ore price drop lower and Chinese demand fall it could spell trouble.\"\n\nThe Liberal-National coalition's second budget next month will be a critical moment. Last year Mr Hockey flagged deep cuts to spending in an attempt to return the budget to surplus. Many of these reforms remain blocked in the Senate. Similar tough medicine this year could undermine confidence at a time when the Reserve Bank of Australia is trying to encourage business investment to diversify the country's resource-dependent economy.\n\n\"There is a need to get businesses to invest and take advantage of opportunities as China transitions to becoming a consumer-led economy,\" says Mr Hogan. \"Agriculture, tourism and education are key sectors.\"\n\nA weakening Australian dollar and a loosening of visa rules are boosting inbound tourism. In the year to the end of September, 789,000 Chinese tourists visited Australia, up 10 per cent on a year earlier. Chinese tourists are now second in number only to New Zealanders \u2014 and they spend the most at A$5.4 billion a year.\n\nWhether these alternative industries can cushion Australia from the collapse in commodity prices remains to be seen.\n\n\"China won't be throwing money at Australia any more,\" says Deloitte's Mr Richardson. \"And there is a real question mark over whether the country is prepared to undertake the reforms needed to transition its economy.\"",
        "generated": "The drop in iron ore prices is negatively impacting Western Australia's economy, with potential losses of A$4 billion in projected royalty revenues and a possible downgrade in the state's credit rating, and there are concerns that the effects could spread across the country.",

Turnbull was also one of the first artists to embrace American abstract expressionism, creating lasting relationships with Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.\n\nHe exhibited extensively over the last 60 years, while the Chatsworth House Trust is to present a major exhibition of his work next year.\n\nThe director of the Tate, Nicholas Serota, said: \"William Turnbull was an exceptional artist, unusually gifted both as a painter and a sculptor. Initially, his distinctive sculpture developed in response to his stay as a young man in postwar Paris, where he met Giacometti, Brancusi and Helion among many others.\"\n\n\"It matured through his admiration for the simple forms of ancient and eastern cultures and his abiding search for the essence in any object. In this he came close to the purity of Barnett Newman, or to his own contemporaries such as Ellsworth Kelly. However, his sculpture and painting always had a humanist sensibility that identified it as profoundly European.\"\n\nTurnbull, who died on Thursday, was the subject last year of a documentary called Beyond Time: William Turnbull, which was released by one of his sons, Alex. Narrated by the actor Jude Law, it re-evaluated the legacy of an often secretive artist who never quite became a household name.\n\nAs well as Alex, Turnbull is also survived by another son, Johnny.

        "text": "There are not many living artists whose every new work you would always want to see, but Tacita Dean is high on that list. At 45, she is the great poet of art film. Over the years, she has turned her deep and elegiac vision to some of the grandest of dramas \u2013 storms, shipwrecks, total solar eclipse \u2013 and some of the smallest, from the passage of diurnal light through a restaurant to the faint breeze that transforms a lake from still landscape to moving picture. Not for nothing has she been variously compared to Terence Davies, Walt Whitman and Edward Hopper.\n\nLately, though, Dean has turned more to the art of the portrait. It suits her origins as a painter. And she has found a way of transforming the single, condensed image that a painter might make over many sittings and long scrutiny by spooling time through a sequence of nearly motionless images.\n\nHer studies of the Italian sculptor Mario Merz and the poet (and translator of WG Sebald) Michael Hamburger are classics of empathetically patient observation. In each, she finds elements of the man in oblique or ephemeral details. The overgrown house, the volatile wind and the sudden arrival of a rainbow, in Hamburger's case, brought this complex man into clearer view.\n\nNow Dean has made an immensely beautiful portrait of one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, the American choreographer Merce Cunningham. It is a perfect collaboration between two kinds of creator. But so strong is the affinity between them that one soon begins to see that they are intent upon the same thing: man's brief walk (or dance) in the sun.\n\nCraneway Event was filmed on 16mm in late 2008, as Cunningham rehearses his dancers in the disused Ford assembly plant on the east shore of San Francisco Bay. Craneway refers to the purpose of this grand canyon of a building, with its full-length windows and vast doors opening on to the quay outside. Event is Cunningham's term for a 100-minute anthology of pieces from the company's repertoire. And this is what Dean appears to give you at first: almost two hours of the master at work, the dancers practising against a backdrop of passing ships and the distant hilltops of Marin County.\n\nBut everything runs against expectation. The film opens with a pelican on the quay steadfastly waiting for the best moment to lift into flight. Inside, technicians are laboriously peeling gaffer tape from the floor. The dancers are pacing round the hall, a parade of earthbound figures apparently whiling away time. Cunningham's quiet arrival, a black-clad figure in a wheelchair, scarcely alters the picture.\n\nAnyone familiar with Dean's work will know that the rehearsal itself is not likely to be the main event. Rather, she notices the totality of the scene: the grids of the windows like hundreds of picture frames on the landscape beyond, the cavernous space, the liquid sheen of the floor with its ever-changing reflections. Her cameras drink in the sunshine. Occasionally, a dancer slides into shot, or a ship glides past, but it gradually becomes apparent that these are Cunningham's preoccupations, too, precisely what inspire the wonderful abstractions of his choreography.\n\nThe dancers move like creatures and objects as much as people. One may be executing a slow circle with his toe, bent arms rotating like propellers, head delicately craned like a bird. Another raises an elegant arm, describing the sail of a yacht. Four together take on the rhythms of an assembly line smoothly alternating with a square dance. A pas de deux becomes an aerial gantry.\n\nAll of this occurs without music. The only sounds are of creak, footfall and soft-shoe shuffle, occasionally broken by Cunningham's mellifluous voice, suggesting a slightly different orientation in space. He appears to view the dance like a painter, holding his pen like a brush, yet he is also within it. The movements all seem to flow through and from him.\n\nDean shows him at a distance, framed by his dancers, or watchfully close, the tendrils of his hair illuminated like a Rembrandt etching. Approaching 90, he still looks forever young and graceful, presiding over the scene like a pensive angel. In one shot, the handles of his chair at shoulder height appear ever so briefly like wings.\n\nA pigeon arrives, appearing to swim in the reflective floor. A man in a stetson ambles along the boardwalk. A great ship passes with such magnificent grace that one can hardly help but think of Cunningham himself, wheeling slowly out of the frame. He died during the editing process; the film becomes both portrait and homage.\n\nCunningham watches and guides with transcendent concentration; so does Dean, whose camera positions are never as anticipated. Both orchestrate movement in mysterious ways. And like Cunningham, Dean is fascinated by the structure of motion and time; her film is, in a sense, open-ended.\n\nThe long day closes, another begins. Light passes through the celluloid as shiftingly as the sun through the high windows. And eventually the viewer, having nearly rebelled at the slowness of both artists' pace, becomes entranced \u2013 calm and poised as the figures on screen, mesmerised by their movements through glowing space.\n\nDean's work is screened too infrequently in this country. Tate Britain owns many of her best films, including Disappearance at Sea and Michael Hamburger, but they are not on permanent display. Occasionally, you catch a work in a mixed show, but it is almost 10 years since her last major exhibition and 12 since she was shortlisted for the Turner prize.\n\nI have no idea why she has never won the prize, since she is one of the most intelligent, profound and inventive artists of her generation. This film (and her enthralling study of nuns in a Cork convent, grace incarnate, shown at the Edinburgh festival last August) could have put her on this year's very strong list. Still, as Cunningham says in his serenely encouraging way, there is always time again tomorrow.",

Last month, Dr. David Torchiana, chief executive of Partners, and Alan Macdonald, CEO of Hallmark, met with the state\u2019s Health Policy Commission, which reviews proposed mergers and their impact on health care costs.\n\nColeen Elstermeyer, the commission\u2019s chief of staff, said Partners executives requested the meeting but did not give any indication about whether they would move ahead with the Hallmark acquisition. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure that out,\u201d Torchiana said in a brief interview Thursday.\n\nA Hallmark spokesman declined to comment.\n\nLast year, the Health Policy Commission voiced concern that Partners\u2019 acquisition of Hallmark would add to Partners\u2019 market power, increase health care spending as much as $23 million a year, and lead to higher premiums for employers and consumers. The commission declined to comment on how it would respond if Partners pursued the deal again.\n\nBut there is little reason to believe the commission would respond differently if Partners and Hallmark presented the same deal, Torchiana acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019d guess we\u2019d have to come up with something that would be significantly different, in all probability,\u201d he said.\n\nPartners, whose network includes 10 hospitals and 6,000 doctors, and Hallmark, which owns Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital in Melrose, have been in talks for at least three years. Their proposal to merge followed Partners\u2019 earlier and more controversial agreement to acquire South Shore Hospital, which already dominated the market south of Boston.\n\nThe two mergers became part of a settlement negotiated by former attorney general Martha Coakley, which allowed the deals to go through in exchange for other concessions, such as price caps. But the settlement was opposed by consumer advocates, antitrust experts, a coalition of Partners competitors, and eventually Coakley\u2019s successor, Attorney General Maura Healey, who took office in January.\n\nThe same month, a judge rejected the settlement, finding that the acquisitions by Partners, one of the state\u2019s most expensive providers, would increase health care costs for consumers. In February, Partners abandoned the South Shore merger, while putting the acquisition of Hallmark on hold.\n\nHealey\u2019s office would not comment on how she would respond if Partners moved ahead with the Hallmark acquisition.\n\nDavid Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington who opposed Partners\u2019 expansion plans, said market power in a Hallmark acquisition would be less of an issue than it was in the proposed South Shore Hospital deal. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201call you have to do is look at the Health Policy Commission\u2019s report and you see there still are concerns there.\u201d\n\nLeaders of Hallmark, which lost $5.8 million on operations last year, have argued that they would not be able to upgrade aging hospital buildings, technology systems, or medical services without the cash and support a new parent company like Partners would provide. Executives of both health systems have said a merger, by putting many different medical services under one organization, would allow for more coordinated care for residents of the North Shore.\n\nThe Hallmark deal was part of a broader plan at Partners to consolidate and reorganize its network in the North Shore. As part of that plan, Partners has moved to close its community hospital in Lynn and expand services at its hospital in Salem, which jointly make up North Shore Medical Center.\n\nAt Hallmark, Partners planned to convert Lawrence Memorial Hospital from an acute-care facility with 134 beds to a smaller short-stay hospital with 20 to 40 beds, while renovating the 234-bed Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.\n\n\u201cPartners had a vision of a combined health care system north of Boston,\u201d said Ruselle W. Robinson, a health care lawyer at Posternak Blankstein & Lund LLP in Boston. \u201cThey have to figure out if that still makes sense. They may want it to look different now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Robinson noted, Hallmark appears to be just waiting. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really done anything. It appears they haven\u2019t looked for another suitor,\u201d he said.\n\nHallmark doctors are part of Partners\u2019 physicians network and many local officials and residents see a takeover by Partners, which generated $11 billion in revenues last year, as the best way to save two struggling community hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe life of our local hospital is much stronger with a merger,\u201d Medford Mayor Michael J. McGlynn said, \u201cand if you have the opportunity to merge with the king, then you should do it.\u201d",

        "text": "House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo vowed Wednesday to put new limits on contracts that restrict employees from working for competitors, breathing new life into a long-running reform campaign that has divided the Massachusetts high-tech sector.\n\nIn a speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, DeLeo said noncompete agreements should be limited to one year. He said the contracts should not apply to lower-wage workers, such as sandwich-shop employees.\n\nWorkers also should be clearly informed that a noncompete agreement is required before taking a job, DeLeo said.\n\n\u201cOur goal will be to protect businesses here and improve Massachusetts\u2019 reputation as the premier incubator for talent,\u201d DeLeo said.\n\nHis support for compromise legislation on noncompete agreements was welcomed by major employers, including EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, which has been a longtime supporter and enforcer of noncompete contracts.\n\nThe state House speaker made the promise for the first time during a speech Wednesday morning at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBut the details of DeLeo\u2019s proposal irked some in the state\u2019s startup sector, who said having any restrictions that prevent workers from taking new jobs makes Massachusetts less competitive with a state like California, where noncompete agreements are largely banned.\n\nThe timing of the bill\u2019s release was unclear, although state lawmakers have only until the end of July before formal sessions end for the year. A spokesman for Senate President Stanley Rosenberg said he isn\u2019t going to comment until he sees the specifics of DeLeo\u2019s proposal, but noted that Rosenberg supported noncompete reforms in 2014.\n\nNoncompete agreements give companies the ability to sue a former employee who takes a similar position in the same industry. Supporters of the agreements say they are an effective way of preventing workers from leaving with valuable trade secrets.\n\nOpponents argue that such agreements stifle innovation by handcuffing people to their jobs, preventing bright employees from launching their own startups or joining fast-growing rivals.\n\nNoncompete agreements typically range from one to two years in Massachusetts, although some are longer, said Christopher H. Lindstrom, a lawyer at Nutter McClennen & Fish. Judges can decide to amend a noncompete agreement, but two-year agreements aren\u2019t usually seen as overly burdensome, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that limiting it to 12 months would have a significant impact on a lot of employers out there,\u201d Lindstrom said.\n\nVenture investors and technology entrepreneurs have made noncompete reform a central part of their public policy lobbying during the past few years. Those efforts gained traction on Beacon Hill in 2014, when the Senate approved a bill that would have made it tougher to enforce noncompete contracts that last longer than six months and prohibited their use for hourly workers.\n\nOne story that particularly resonated with lawmakers came from a college student from Wellesley who told them she had lost her summer job at a camp when management realized she had a noncompete agreement in effect with a nearby camp.\n\nDeLeo and other House leaders declined to go along with the Senate at the time.\n\n\u201cHaving him support reform really feels like progress,\u201d said Jody Rose, executive director of the New England Venture Capital Association.\n\nEMC\u2019s support is also significant. The company has previously opposed efforts to change noncompete laws, but EMC\u2019s general counsel, Paul Dacier, said Wednesday that DeLeo\u2019s proposal \u201cprotects legitimate business interests while ensuring continued growth of our state\u2019s innovation economy.\u201d\n\nDeLeo and his staff worked closely with business leaders, including the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, during the past year to fashion a compromise bill. The involvement of the partnership, which consists of some of the most powerful CEOs in the state, started about a year ago, president Daniel O\u2019Connell said. \u201cThe group felt they could provide some constructive input about a compromise on the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nEMC\u2019s chief executive, Joe Tucci, is among the partnership\u2019s members, but O\u2019Connell declined to disclose the specific stance of any individual members. He said his group reached a consensus on the issue, and that the consensus is reflected in the reforms suggested by DeLeo on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe speaker did not address all of our recommendations, but we felt he hit all the important points,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cTwelve months seemed like a reasonable compromise to protect the intellectual property of employers and also allow employees to plot their own career paths.\u201d\n\nAssociated Industries of Massachusetts, another business group, had been one of the most vocal supporters of noncompetes. But spokesman Chris Geehern said DeLeo\u2019s proposal appears to be a reasonable compromise. He said DeLeo consulted with AIM several times before Wednesday\u2019s speech.\n\nDemocratic Representative Lori Ehrlich of Marblehead has aggressively pursued bills to eliminate or restrict noncompetes for years. She said she would prefer a ban on them, but sees DeLeo\u2019s approach as a big step forward in the debate.\n\nSome notable members of the state\u2019s tech sector, however, panned DeLeo\u2019s plan as too limited.\n\nTravel-tech veteran Paul English noted that he had to wait 18 months to start his newest company, Lola, to avoid a lawsuit under his noncompete agreement with a previous employer, Priceline Group. Restricting noncompete agreements to one year, he said, would still seriously limit entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cI frankly think it\u2019s just so weak that it almost has no impact,\u201d English said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019d be kind of like the new mayor of Flint, Mich., saying \u2018Let\u2019s just clean up half the water. We\u2019re still going to make kids sick, but they\u2019ll be a little bit less sick.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd Bijan Sabet, an investor with the Boston venture firm Spark Capital, said, \u201cWhy do employees in our state have less rights than employees in California?\u201d\n\nJeff Bussgang, a general partner at another Boston venture firm, Flybridge Capital Partners, sees DeLeo\u2019s stance as a positive development, but acknowledged that progress has been slow, especially for startups that are used to the fast pace of the innovation sector.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on noncompete reform for like five years,\u201d Bussgang said. \u201cAs an entrepreneur, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. You\u2019re like, \u2018Problem? Solve the problem. What could be simpler?\u2019 \u201d",

Visitors might also pay more attention to the portable toilets that sometimes line the semi-hidden graveyard's perimeter.\n\nDepending on the angle, the graveyard can be clearly seen. But most people don\u2019t know about it \u2014 or choose to ignore it. Descendants of the Sheldon family prefer to keep it that way.\n\n\u201cWe came over here one time, probably 20 years ago, and all the stones were all tipped over and letters chipped off it \u2014 vandalism,\u201d Gary Sheldon said while raking freshly cut blades of grass from his ancestors\u2019 tombstones.\n\nThis prompted the Bills to build around the cemetery and plant foliage as a buffer between tailgaters and the somber graveyard. \u201cEver since, [the Bills] tightened security over here nobody comes back. Because you could drive back here at any time. There was no security. But I appreciate that there is security now.\u201d\n\nIt's hardly the first time that infrastructure or construction projects have brushed up against the resting places for the dead: They can sometimes be found in car parks of malls, and mass burials have proven to be roadblocks for rail expansions in the UK.\n\nA less common spot, however? In the shadows of a stadium belonging to a team that's part of the most profitable, popular sporting league in the United States.\n\nA resting place surrounded by Portaloos\n\nSo how did more than 20 people end up buried in a highly trafficked car park? The answer dates back nearly two centuries, long before the Buffalo Bills team was established in 1960.\n\nIt started in 1832 when Joseph Sheldon, a surveyor for the Holland Land Company, asked his neighbour Solomon Curtis if he might have permission to bury his infant son John, who died just weeks after birth, in the clearing of an apple orchard a short walk from a local creek.\n\nCurtis permitted the burial, eventually deeding the small parcel of land to Joseph Sheldon with one stipulation, according to a 1986 article in the Orchard Park Bee, a local newspaper: Joseph must reserve a plot of land for Curtis to be buried when the time came. (It\u2019s unclear, however, if Curtis was ever actually interred in the land as he had requested.)\n\nBut through the years, the cemetery grew: Joseph Sheldon died, was buried beside his infant son John, and was followed by his wife Tryphena, their children, plus members of the extended family, neighbours and descendants. The last cemetery plot was dug after 1920, shortly before the Curtis family sold the surrounding land to the DuPont Company, the American chemicals conglomerate.\n\nThe descendants of those buried in the sporting arena's car park still live in the area to this day.\n\nDean Hartloff, a direct descendant of Joseph and Tryphena, and Gary Hartloff\u2019s distant cousin, explained that the cemetery went unnoticed for decades. Grass, dirt and brush obscured stones, inscriptions faded flat with time, and some stones disappeared altogether.\n\nOwnership of the land around the cemetery changed hands a few times. It was eventually sold to Erie County to build the Bills stadium.\n\nIn the US, the NFL is a cultural phenomenon: in 2015, the top 12 television shows of the fall season were NFL games, according to a USA Today report. Last season, the NFL's revenues reached $13 billion (\u00a310.4 billion).\n\nAccording family lore, Ralph Wilson, owner of the Bills at the time of the sale to Erie County, planned to position the football field\u2019s 50-yard line right where the cemetery was located \u2014 until the Sheldon descendents got wind of the tentative plan to exhume the graves.\n\n\u201cWhen the county decided to put the football stadium out there, they had to get the approval of the living relatives of those in the cemetery,\u201d Dean Hartloff said. \u201cI had a couple hard-headed great-aunts\u201d \u2014 one of whom was his aunt Hermine Hartloff, the mother of Gary Hartloff, the cemetery\u2019s sole groundskeeper today \u2014 \u201cwho refused to sign off, who wouldn\u2019t let them move the cemetery.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Ralph Wilson didn\u2019t wait, he just built around it,\u201d Dean Hartloff said of the team\u2019s previous owner.\n\nThe stadium design was flipped as to not disturb the graves. Unfortunately for the Bills, the stadium\u2019s open end had to face east-west rather than north-south, allowing a sort of lopsided crosswind to enter the stadium that is often blamed for kickers\u2019 and quarterbacks\u2019 in-game blunders.\n\nThe curse of the Bills\n\nIt\u2019s true: The physical presence of the cemetery has inadvertently hindered the Bills performance on the field.\n\nBut some believe that it\u2019s greater, stranger forces than uncooperative winds that\u2019s punished the team \u2014 which notoriously lost four consecutive Super Bowl championship games in the early 1990s.\n\nAccording to a marker at the entrance of the Sheldon Family Cemetery, \u201can early Erie Indian village was also located on the site of the stadium.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn 2012, writer Aaron Lowinger researched the area where the stadium is located, and found that a community of Wenro Indians once occupied the land. Western New York, to be clear, was once populated by various Native American tribes. The 1797 Treaty of Big Tree was largely responsible for forcing many of the native tribes in and around Buffalo from their homes and into reservations, so it\u2019s generally safe to assume that all of Buffalo and its surrounding suburbs once belonged to Native Americans.\n\nIn his research, Lowinger found a 1920 \u201catlas of aboriginal localities\u201d that specifically identifies the land on which the stadium is built as an Indian burial ground. \u201cA large cemetery was destroyed by contractors and many clay vessels were broken and thrown in excavation,\u201d the atlas entry reads.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t just pave over. They dug into it. If this were happening today, maybe there\u2019d be more respect to whatever\u2019s there,\u201d Lowinger said. \u201c[It was] just a postcolonial mess up there. The Native American village that\u2019s historically and anthropologically significant \u2014 it was dug up.\u201d\n\nSo not only was the stadium almost responsible for disturbing the Sheldon cemetery \u2014 but documentation indicates that stadium was built on a Native American graveyard.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fool with sacred grounds,\u201d Gary Hartloff said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ever explore whether there was Indian burial grounds there.\u201d\n\nMany die-hard Bills fans don\u2019t even know the graveyard exists, since it\u2019s partly hidden in the very car park where they drink and party before each home game.\n\nNot even current team owner Terry Pegula had heard of it \u2014 until a few weeks ago.\n\nWhen approached outside the stadium (a football\u2019s throw from the cemetery) before a Bills match against the New England Patriots on 30 October, Pegula said he was unaware the cemetery even existed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that,\u201d he said in response to a request for comment. \u201cSo I can\u2019t help you.\u201d\n\nSo, why has the cemetery endured so long? Why hasn\u2019t it been bulldozed to make room for more parking spaces, or a hot dog stand?\n\nIt\u2019s because the Bills don\u2019t own the cemetery. Problem is, no one knows who actually does\u2026 not even the Hartloffs.\n\nBefore moving from western New York to the Baltimore area in 2000, Dean Hartloff made frequent visits to the cemetery to clean it up, just as his parents, aunts and uncles before him had done. But with Dean Hartloff now living hundreds of miles away, and with his parents, aunts and uncles deceased, his cousin Gary Hartloff is the sole Sheldon descendent to take responsibility for maintaining the family cemetery grounds.\n\nThe trouble for both Gary and Dean Hartloff is they\u2019re not sure who will step up to tend to their ancestors\u2019 graves.\n\nYounger members of the family tree have expressed interest in pitching in, but none have kept their word, Gary Hartloff explained while cleaning grass cuttings from headstones in the cemetery.\n\n\u201cWhen I take a dirt bath it\u2019ll probably all go away, you know what I mean?\u201d he added, rake still in hand.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Gary Hartloff says he doesn\u2019t know who owns the cemetery. He assumed the town of Orchard Park owned it. Orchard Park doesn\u2019t own it, though. And neither does Erie County, which owns the stadium and its parking lots.\n\n\u201cErie County owns the entire facility. We leased the stadium structure to New York state, which then subleases it to the Bills. The parking lots are owned by the county and leased by the Bills,\u201d says Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. But the Sheldon Family Cemetery is \u201cthe only parcel in that entire complex, of the hundreds of acres, that is not owned by Erie County.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a mystery who owns it,\u201d Poloncarz admitted. But based on the records he does have, he knows for certain that the family has access to the cemetery in perpetuity, and he suspects a family member does have the deed in his or her possession.\n\nFinding a cemetery in a seemingly unlikely place isn\u2019t as uncommon as it may seem. In the US alone, there are multiple documented burial grounds in car parks and roadways, such as the Burr family cemetery in a Long Island Home Depot parking lot and the final resting place of Mary Ellis outside of a New Jersey cineplex. Then there are the undocumented burial grounds that are discovered during construction.\n\nThe reality is that cemeteries are everywhere, below our feet \u2013 and tyres. We just don\u2019t know it.\n\nThe Bills have been pressured by NFL executives in recent years to move the stadium to a new location, which would leave the cemetery in limbo beside a vacant football field, surrounded by a vast expanse of parking spaces.\n\nPoloncarz isn\u2019t worried, though. The Bills are just entering the fourth season of a 10-year lease.\n\nAs for the supposed Bills curse, he\u2019s not buying it.\n\n\u201cI feel confident for the near future that the Bills will be playing in Orchard Park with the Sheldon family watching over them for some time,\u201d Poloncarz said. \u201cIn the long run we will win the Super Bowl, and I don\u2019t think the stadium location will have much of an effect on it.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this or anything else you have seen on BBC Autos, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

The Sheldon Family Cemetery is surrounded by trees and a fence, and is only accessible through a narrow path between the parking lot and the stadium. Despite its location, the cemetery has remained relatively unknown to football fans and stadium staff, with some even believing it to be a secret or concealed. The cemetery contains over 20 graves, including that of Joseph Sheldon, who died in 1832, and his wife Tryphena. The last burial took place in 1920, and the cemetery has been maintained by the Hartloff family, who still live in the area. The stadium was built around the cemetery in the 1970s, and the family was able to preserve the graveyard due to a stipulation in the deed that prohibited the cemetery from being disturbed. The cemetery's existence has been a source of fascination and mystery for some, with some believing it to be cursed, while others view it as a piece of history that should be preserved.",

She succeeds John P. Bilbrey, who in October had announced his intention to retire from the candy maker in 2017. The maker of the namesake chocolate, Reese's, and Twizzlers said that compensation arrangements for both Buck and Bilbrey\u2014who will continue as non-executive chairman of the board\u2014hasn't yet been determined.\n\nSince joining Hershey in 2005, Buck has steered a few notable strategies including the acquisitions of Krave beef jerky and healthy chocolate brand barkThins. She also spearheaded the company's growing core confection portfolio. Buck, who is 55, was picked to serve as CEO after Hershey said it reviewed both internal and external candidates as it mulled the succession.\n\nLike many of the nation's largest food and beverage manufacturers, Hershey has faced some sales challenges as it confronts changing consumer preferences that include a move away from big established brands in favor of upstart rivals\u2014a trend that has led to some deal-making like the acquisitions Hershey has been involved in. Still, sales growth remains a challenge for most. Hershey's sales slipped in 2015 to $7.39 billion from $7.42 billion the prior year. Hershey is predicting a slim increase of just around 1% for 2016.\n\nHershey even found itself the takeover target of snacking giant Mondelez (mdlz), a deal that died earlier this year after Mondelez said it realized that there was no path forward toward an agreement. The potential $23 billion hostile takeover effort was stonewalled by the Milton Hershey Trust, which controls 80% of shareholder votes at Hershey. Buck will now be responsible for leading Hershey into the future as a stand-alone company.\n\nThe appointment of Buck is notable for a few reasons. With Hershey's $7.4 billion in annual revenue, she will become one of just 25 women to run a Fortune 500 company. Hershey ranked #362 on the most recent list. Her appointment also adds another women to the growing list of female executives that steer Big Food companies. Other notable executives on that list include PepsiCo's (pep) Indra Nooyi, Campbell Soup's (cpb) Denise Morrison, and Mondelez's Irene Rosenfeld\u2014all who rank on Fortune's Most Powerful Women list.\n\nThe changing of the guard at Hershey is also the third notable change at the top of a major food and beverage brand this month.

        "text": "t first glance, it may seem a long shot in an era of orange alerts and stepped-up border patrols. But quietly and carefully, elected officials, labor unions and community groups are starting to push the notion of allowing legal immigrants who are not United States citizens to vote in New York City elections.\n\nSupporters say it is not an outlandish proposition. They point out that even without citizenship, legal immigrants pay taxes, send their children to public schools and serve in the military. Noncitizens in many states were allowed to vote in local, state and even Congressional elections as recently as the 1920's. Until New York City moved to abolish its school boards two years ago, all residents had the right to vote for and serve on them. And although a proposal to open city elections to immigrants was raised 10 years ago without success, some people believe that the time may now be right.\n\nIn the last decade, five towns in Maryland have allowed noncitizens, even illegal immigrants, to vote in local elections. Campaigns for immigrant voting rights are under way in several cities, including Hartford; Cambridge, Mass.; and Washington, where Mayor Anthony Williams has said he supports giving legal immigrants the vote in District of Columbia elections.\n\nThose initiatives may be taken more seriously in a campaign season when politicians in both major parties are making overtures to immigrants, as President Bush has with his proposal to grant temporary legal status to millions now living here illegally.\n\nFor the moment, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has declined to express an opinion on the subject, and Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said this week that he was still studying the legal issues. Several union locals have quietly indicated their support, though only one has formally joined the coalition that is promoting the idea.\n\nAt a minimum, it is an intriguing prospect in a city with about a million legal immigrants of voting age who are not citizens \u0097 equivalent to more than a fifth of the total number of current voters. Granting those people, most of them Hispanic or Asian, the right to vote could change the electoral calculus in a number of arenas, from the races for mayor and the five borough presidents to ballot questions on city borrowing and building projects.\n\nThe new voters would be more likely to elect minority candidates, political analysts say, and could force politicians to become more responsive to issues like deportation policy and immigrant access to health care. If voting rights were extended to the state level \u0097 truly a long shot at this point \u0097 the effects would be even greater, forcing redistricting that could affect the balance of power in Congress. Although all residents are counted when district lines are redrawn, normally only eligible voters are included when the new districts are challenged in court under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"This would be seismic in its impact,\" said Roberto Ramirez, a political consultant and lawyer who has served as a state assemblyman and chairman of the Bronx Democratic Party. \"Both parties would have to develop a different mindset to address policy issues for those residents who have historically not been part of the political process.\"\n\nNationally, there are more than 10 million legal immigrants who are not citizens, according to estimates based on census figures. Some are waiting to become citizens, a process that often takes as long as 10 years with the current backlog of applications. Others are not eligible for citizenship because they are here on temporary visas, or have simply not applied.\n\nIn New York City, the latest proposals are still being drafted by two council members, Bill Perkins and John C. Liu. Supporters all agree that whatever measure surfaces, it should extend the vote to legal immigrants who are eligible to become citizens. Some would prefer a broader law to include anyone who pays taxes, regardless of immigration status.\n\nThere will certainly be opponents. Critics say that giving newcomers the right to vote would undermine the very idea of citizenship.",

        "text": "It began as an attempt to restore one blurry image that had been hidden for a century behind a large built-in wardrobe on William Morris's bedroom wall.\n\nMonths later, the painstaking removal of layers of paint and wallpaper revealed that an entire wall at the artist and craftsman's first married home was painted by his young friends who would become world famous pre-Raphaelite artists.\n\nThe near life size figures on the wall at the Red House, now buried in south east London suburbia at Bexleyheath, are now believed to represent the joint work of Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, his wife Elizabeth Siddal, Ford Madox Brown, as well as Morris.\n\n\"In the morning we had one and a half murky figures, in the evening we had an entire wall covered in a pre-Raphaelite painting of international importance,\" James Breslin, property manager at the Red House, said.\n\n\"We had no idea what the figures, or the newly revealed inscriptions, represented, but at the Red House it pretty much has to be Chaucer, Arthurian myth or the Bible \u2013 all fairly daunting works to start reading line by line,\" Breslin added.\n\nThe property managers decided to tweet an appeal for people to help identify the text, and, Breslin said, that within an hour a tweet came back saying \"Try Genesis 30:6\", which reads \"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son\".\n\nThe figures are from the Bible, including Rachel, Noah holding a model ark, Adam and Eve, and Jacob with his ladder \u2013 the latter possibly by Morris himself \u2013 painted as if on a tapestry furled across the wall.\n\nHowever the imagery is more complex, because scholars believe it also relates to another cherished pre-Raphaelite Arthurian legend, Sir Degrevaunt who married his mortal enemy's daughter. But then neither family thought much of Morris's choice of Janey Burden, the beautiful daughter of an Oxford stable man.\n\nThe mural is also a significant discovery for the National Trust. Ten years ago the National Trust bought the redbrick house studded with romantic details including turrets, stained glass, window seats, a miniature minstrels' gallery and a well, and opened it to the public for the first time.\n\nWhen built, the property was commissioned by Morris in 1860 from the young left wing architect Philip Webb, as a home for his new wife Burden and anticipated large family, it stood among Kent apple orchards. After Morris's day, it passed through a string of private hands and lost almost all the beautiful furnishings designed for it.\n\nNevertheless it has produced a string of surprises, including traces of wall and ceiling paintings in almost every room. \"Basically every white surface in the house is suspect \u2013 there will be colour underneath it,\" Breslin said. \"Why have three clashing patterns when you can have six, seems to have been their motto.\"\n\nIn the drawing room, intended by Morris to be \"the most beautiful room in the world\", panelling was removed to reveal paintings by Burne Jones and probably Rossetti, and some by Morris including roses on a blue background which may be his first attempt at a repeat flower pattern.\n\nSuch patterns, manufactured by his company, would by the end of the century cover half the middle class walls and sofas of England. In one painting a dog curled up under a chair has turned out to be a wombat, and therefore almost certainly Rossetti's work: he was bizarrely obsessed with the animals, and once owned one as a pet \u2013 it died after reputedly eating a box of cigars.\n\nIn the bedroom the discovery almost doubled the cost of the conservation work, to \u00a3110,000. Fragments showing up on the ceiling and the other walls \u2013 partly covered by a particularly horrible 1960s version of Morris's classic willow boughs design, whose owner could never have guessed they were burying a genuine piece by the master \u2013 suggest there is much more work to come.\n\nBreslin points out that Morris at Red House was far from \"the tub thumping grey bearded socialist\" of later years. They were all young, and it was a party house, devoted to games of hide and seek, music, silly practical jokes and food fights in the drawing room.\n\nGeorgie Burne Jones recalled that they once stitched the back of Morris's waistcoat so the buttons wouldn't do up, causing him to agonise over growing fat.\n\nThe idyll under the apple trees barely lasted five years. Burne Jones' month old son died of scarlet fever which almost killed his mother, and Lizzie Siddall died of an overdose. Morris, exhausted by the long commute into London, the lovely house half mortgaged to his mother, sold up. His Guenevere, Janey, went on to have an affair with his best friend Rossetti which almost broke his heart.\n\n\"So much of the work was never finished because they were young and they thought they had all the time in the world,\" Breslin said. \"As it turned out, they hadn't.\"",

        "text": "'Theatrical and mystifying' \u2026 one of the scenes of finality at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris. Photograph: Andr\u00e9 Morin\n\nWith thunder in the air, rain falls through the skylight smashed by a falling meteor that has bored its way through the concrete floor, leaving a gaping hole and a cavern below. I peer in and see strip lights blinking in the dark.\n\nThis is just one of the theatrical and mystifying moments in Hiroshi Sugimoto's exhibition Aujourd'hui, le monde est mort (Lost Human Genetic Archive) at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris. Part of a riveting cycle of shows that fill the building, Sugimoto's is both entertaining and a mournful experience. If the meteor doesn't get you, there are plenty more morbid, memorable moments in the clearings and corridors of his end-times phantasmagoria, installed amid a warren of rusted walls of corrugated metal sheeting.\n\n\"The world died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know \u2026\" Sugimoto writes, on the many handwritten notes that double as captions as we make our way round. Echoing the beginning of Albert Camus's 1942 novel The Stranger, which begins with almost the same words (\"Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday \u2026\"), the phrase keeps recurring, leitmotif and chorus. Swapping \"mother\" with \"world\" implies a final, universal end of fertility and the breaking of the primal bond. It's also fun.\n\nImagining the end of the world is a great creative conceit and has its own perverse fertility. The end is always with us \u2013 end of the novel, death of the author, death of painting, no more bees (in one section of the show, the beekeeper has hung up his clobber and the hive is empty). No more people, end of the world. The end.\n\n\"Imagining the worst conceivable tomorrows gives me tremendous pleasure at the artistic level,\" says Sugimoto. \"The darkness of the future lights up my present.\"\n\nHe is best known for his bleak, empty and sometimes beautiful black-and-white photographs, and his remarks make me peer into his images more intently, looking for signs and tremors. This is an unexpected show from an artist associated with images of horizons, iceflows, collections of Buddhas and empty cinemas whose screens are filled with glowing blank voids (for these, Sugimoto left the shutter open for the duration of the projected film, recording only a luminous, numinous blank).\n\nOnly a small number of Sugimoto's own photographs are included here. Instead, he presents us with scenes of apocalyptic, whimpering, cataclysmic and drawn-out finality. A 13th-century carved sculpture of Kaminari-sama, the Shinto god of thunder, stands atop a stone staircase, rescued from a ruined house and leering maniacally. On the wall opposite, ancient fossils sit in cabinets. Sugimoto sees these little cabinets as incubators. Maybe they're waiting for a flash of galvanising lightning to bring them back to life.\n\nSugimoto provides his own, using a hidden Faraday cage to create indoor lightning, and displaying camera-less photographs whose images are produced using electromagnetic charges. (He is only following Fox Talbot, the pioneer of early photography who used the same technique.) Artificial weather and lifelike artifice are part of Sugimoto's theme.\n\nHis captions are as fanciful as they are informative, and not always easy to read. A guidebook would have been more helpful. Near a collection of Barbie dolls, one note claims: \"I wanted to be a Barbie when I grew up.\" Cosmetic surgery made this possible. \"Genes went haywire and made seedless melons out of everyone,\" the caption notes.\n\nAll this leads, we later discover, to the creation of a race of hermaphrodites. Futuristic gender trouble is a favourite sci-fi ploy. Beneath a 1750s engraving of hermaphroditic genitalia, by the French anatomist and artist Jacques Fabien Gautier d'Agoty, Sugimoto places a lifesize supine figure in a gorgeous, 16th-century geometric Noh play costume, with an equally old, androgynous Kassiki mask for a face. The figure's head sits under a glass dome. It is a wonderful and erotic thing, with arms outstretched like an immobilised angel. Beneath the clothes, the figure is bound like an Egyptian mummy.\n\nIf it weren't for the quality of the exhibits in Sugimoto's wunderkammer, most of which come from his own collection, all this could be tiresome, teetering into kitsch. Instead it is a treasure trove of the marvellous, frightful and bizarre. It is also an extremely dense exhibition, full of odd things you don't notice first time round. Real space-programme vessels for astronauts' pee and poo, an enormous stone phallus on a gurney, odd confabulations that refer to the works of Marcel Duchamp and Warhol. One display includes a greenish-brown lead-glass sphere, which was made as a window to inspect the reactions in making a \"Nagasaki-type\" atomic bomb in America's Manhattan Project. The timing device of a second world war Japanese torpedo, a map of Iwojima and a macabre US military \"Jap Hunting License ('Open Season \u2013 No Limit')\" occupy the same display, while round the corner another strange gas-masked figure lies rigid on a stretcher.\n\nAll this does not prepare one for Sugimoto's remaking of Duchamp's \u00c9tant donn\u00e9s, the work Duchamp made in secret over the last 20 years of his life. The elements of Duchamp's work have been replaced \u2013 with a hyper-real sex doll, made by a Japanese company, on a couch, a gas lamp on the stool beside her, and a photographic backdrop of a rainforest by Sugimoto. The accompanying sound of a waterfall is reproduced by computer-generated white noise. It feels so alive, so real, so fake, so dead. Like life but not life, it has little of the mystery and none of the voyeurism of Duchamp's original.\n\nBut I swear the thunder was real on my visit, even though it felt laid on. So, too, was the rain through the skylight. In the distance, at the end of a corridor, hangs one of Sugimoto's seascapes. Black sea, grey sky; it is an image of an unpeopled, indifferent world. It warms the heart.\n\n\u2022 Aujourd'hui le monde est mort (Lost Human Genetic Archive) is at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 7 September.",

        "text": "In a new study published in JAMA Surgery, researchers say that 70% of women with breast cancer in one breast who decide to remove the other breast do so unnecessarily. In fact, only 10% of women diagnosed with breast cancer should consider such prophylactic mastectomy, say experts.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t kept rates of mastectomies from climbing. In the 1990s, about 1% of women diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast opted to have the other one removed; that percentage has jumped to 20% in recent years.\n\nMORE: Angelina Jolie\u2019s Double Mastectomy: It\u2019s Not the Only Option\n\nThis increase is despite the fact that studies don\u2019t show that removing an unaffected breast can lower a woman\u2019s risk of recurrence or increase her chances of surviving the disease. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that there are other reasons\u2014perfectly understandable and deeply human ones\u2014that may be guiding women\u2019s choices. We spoke with leading experts and identified these four.\n\n1. A fear of doing nothing\n\n\u201cFear is absolutely driving the decision,\u201d says Dr. Isabelle Bedrosian of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cI definitely understand that fear; we often hear, \u2018I don\u2019t want to deal with this ever again.\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s reasonable, especially for women who go through the rigors of chemotherapy, and who are worried about surviving their disease so they can be there for their children and their families.\n\nThat fear, however, can overshadow reason. Bedrosian was not involved in the current study, but published a trial in 2010 in which she and her colleagues found that only a small and specific group of women diagnosed with breast cancer\u2014those under age 50, with early stage disease that was negative for estrogen receptors\u2014may benefit from having both breasts removed. These women enjoyed a nearly 5% improved chance of survival five years after diagnosis than those who did not have the unaffected breast removed. But as the current study found, this represented less than 10% of women with breast cancer.\n\nStudies also show that the chances of breast cancer recurring in the opposite breast are very, very small. In fact, breast cancer patients are more likely to develop recurrent tumors in other parts of the body\u2014the liver, lungs, or the brain\u2014than they are their other breast. Still, says Hawley, \u201cThere are probably other things caught up in the variable of worry, from not wanting to think about [cancer] anymore, to not wanting to regret anything in the future if something did happen.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: MRI: A New Tool to Detect Recurrent Breast Cancer\n\n2. Early detection means too much information\n\nTechnology may also play a role in driving up rates of just-in-case surgery. More women are getting an MRI of the breast, both as a way to screen for breast cancer and to give doctors a better picture of the tumors. These images are refined enough to pick up the tiniest of lesions, including those that may not need treatment. But it\u2019s hard for women to do nothing at all after learning they have a growth in their breast, even if they might be benign and not require treatment. In such moments, it\u2019s likely that every instinct tells women to do something. \u201cThe feeling is to do everything possible, and doing everything possible means more surgery,\u201d says Hawley.\n\n3. The pink ribbon brigade\n\nBreast cancer advocacy is a model of how to mobilize and educate the public about a disease. Rates of screening have gone up while death rates have come down (although it is still the leading cancer killer among U.S. women). The awareness about the disease and the push for better treatments, however, have magnified the obligation and responsibility behind every choice, from screening to diagnosis and treatment. And that\u2019s especially true about the decision surrounding prophylactic surgery. \u201cThere is a hyper awareness surrounding prophylactic mastectomy, and many women are choosing it without a clear understanding of why,\u201d says Bedrosian.\n\nCoverage of celebrities\u2019 decisions to proactively remove their breasts may also heighten the urgency of taking aggressive action for many women. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone publicly who has said they were diagnosed with breast cancer recently and chose to have lumpectomy with radiation,\u201d says Hawley. (Good Morning American anchor Amy Robach, who does not carry the BRCA breast cancer genes which put women at higher risk of recurrence, still decided to have a double mastectomy.) \u201cThere is a feeling that doing everything you can is a way to take control. And just doing a lumpectomy and radiation may not be taking as much control as choosing a double mastectomy.\u201d\n\nMORE: Study: Double Mastectomy May Not Improve Survival\n\n4. Not enough accurate information about options\n\nBedrosian admits that part of the reason women are choosing to proactively remove their breasts, even when they may not need to, has to do with the fact that doctors don\u2019t have the best tools for helping patients make this decision. For the 10% of women at high risk of having recurrent breast cancer, the decision isn\u2019t as challenging. But for the remaining 90%, many of whom may not have a genetic risk but have distant relatives with the disease, the decision becomes harder. \u201cCommunication is important to make sure that patients are informed about the medical facts,\u201d says Bedrosian. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make sure that our patients are making informed choices and not simply fear-driven choices.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a very personal\u2014and complicated\u2014decision, in which each of these factors, and many others, may take on varying degrees of importance.",

        "text": "Among the new models that BMW will introduce in 2013, two stand out. The first, a sports coupe named the 4 Series, is instantly recognizable as a BMW. A bit lower and wider than the 3 Series coupe it replaces, it will be built at BMW\u2019s Spartanburg, S.C., manufacturing complex and sell for prices starting at about $45,000.\n\nThe second vehicle, an all-electric city car called the i3, is unlike anything BMW \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter \u2014 has ever made. Its weight-saving carbon-fiber body is wrapped in layers of electronic services and smartphone apps designed to make life simpler and save time for the owner. Searching for a parking space? The i3 will help you find one at your destination \u2014 as well as arrange to rent out your space at home while you are gone. Need a charge for the lithium-ion batteries? Another feature locates the nearest charging station and arranges for an emergency boost if you can\u2019t find it. Should you be planning a trip out of town, BMW will help you swap your electric car for a gasoline-powered one with a longer range.\n\nEngineering cars that make driving pleasure a top priority has made BMW the bestselling luxury brand in the world. Its cars are renowned for innovative design, high-performing engines, and exceptional handling. The i3 has none of those things. It is designed for utility and fuel economy, and when it goes on sale this fall, it will be expensive \u2014 about $40,000 \u2014 and probably appeal to a small number of people. So why is the Munich automaker risking its reputation by venturing into unproven new technologies where sales will be tiny and profits a challenge?\n\nThe answer goes to the heart of BMW\u2019s long-running success. It wants to be seen as a manufacturer of cars that serve a real purpose. In pursuit of that goal, it has made this detour. While BMW believes that the luxury-car market will remain robust, it also thinks buyers are becoming more interested in two qualities that it has largely ignored: sustainability and interconnectedness. In its new mission statement it aspires to become the \u201cworld\u2019s leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility.\u201d In other words, BMW wants to make cars that are plugged-in and eco-conscious.\n\nWhat the initiative means for BMW is uncertain. Six months after the i3\u2019s introduction, it will launch the second car in its i Series, a $125,000 grand touring car with a plug-in hybrid drivetrain. Other electric models are expected to follow. In all, they will require an investment of several billion euros, with little prospect of a quick payoff \u2014 a tremendous risk for a company that, in its entirety, is smaller than GM\u2019s Chevrolet division. Rumors have appeared in the automotive press that BMW has canceled or postponed some models because of weak electric-vehicle sales, or is adding gasoline-assisted versions as a hedge against buyer resistance. But BMW\u2019s top executives appear committed. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind,\u201d chairman and chief executive Norbert Reithofer told Fortune, \u201cthat sustainable thinking and action is an essential condition for long-term growth, higher profitability, and the development of new customer segments and pioneering technologies.\u201d\n\nBMW embarks on its new direction from a rock-solid financial base. BMW Group\u2019s brands \u2014 BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce \u2014 all set sales records in 2012. Sales of BMW cars alone rose 12%, to 1.54 million, besting Mercedes-Benz and Audi for the title of the world\u2019s most popular premium brand. In the U.S., 281,460 BMWs were sold, leaving Cadillac, Buick, and Acura in the dust. BMW\u2019s market capitalization has surged to 45 billion euros, twice the value of Mercedes. The stock is up 30% in the past six months and hit an all-time high in January.\n\nAt BMW the car has always been the star. The company\u2019s heart and soul is the Forschungs- und Innovationszentrum, the research and innovation center known as the FIZ. A short drive from corporate headquarters in Munich, the FIZ is home to some 8,900 engineers and others who bring together the three essential functions of the car business \u2014 product development, procurement, and marketing.\n\nIn 2007, though, BMW was faced with problems that could not be solved at the FIZ and that threatened BMW\u2019s survival as an independent company. Rising commodity prices and the expensive euro were driving up the costs of manufacturing at the same time that automakers were investing large sums to meet EU regulations for CO2 emissions. Traffic congestion in cities and an aging customer base were depressing demand for high-performance cars. Chairman and chief executive Helmut Panke had sold off the money-losing Rover Group and led BMW\u2019s expansion in North America and China, but the supervisory board declined to extend his contract when he reached the mandatory retirement age. In his place it installed a dark-horse candidate, a manufacturing specialist named Norbert Reithofer. Reithofer, then 50, had spent most of his career in production, making his reputation by halving the time required to ramp up production of a new 3 Series car.\n\nReithofer set out to understand the threats to the company and the factors that were braking its profitability. He identified some 200 economic, technological, and social trends likely to shape BMW\u2019s future. \u201cIt became obvious that our competitive position was at stake,\u201d Reithofer explained at the time. \u201cWe realized that we couldn\u2019t carry on as we had before.\u201d\n\nThe project was controversial. \u201cMany people didn\u2019t understand back then why the company needed to make changes after being successful for so many years,\u201d he told Fortune recently. \u201cBut things are different now. The results have shown that we are on the right track.\u201d\n\nWith his study in hand, Reithofer set in motion what he called Strategy No. 1: BMW would become the leading provider of premium products and services for individual mobility by 2020. BMW watchers understood that it was a radical plan. Reithofer\u2019s focus on \u201cpremium\u201d was a clear refutation of BMW\u2019s foray into mid-price cars with the Rover acquisition. And his declaration that BMW would provide \u201cpremium services\u201d as well as \u201cpremium products\u201d signaled that BMW would be venturing beyond the FIZ. Reithofer also set ambitious financial targets. By 2012 he wanted BMW to sell 1.8 million vehicles, earn operating margins of 8% to 10%, and achieve a return on capital of 26%.\n\nThe next step was figuring out how to meet the targets. In the spring of 2008 he assembled some of the company\u2019s most innovative thinkers at a secret location in Munich and gave them instructions to redefine personal transportation for the 21st century. A team traveled around the world, visiting big cities, interviewing urban planners and architects, and talking to residents. After nine months the thinkers came up with a new direction. BMW would follow two different paths: one evolutionary, with efficient combustion engines and the technologies that surround them \u2014 its traditional car business, in other words \u2014 and the other revolutionary, with electric powertrains, recyclable materials, and software-driven mobility services.\n\nStrategy No. 1 gave birth to \u201cProject i\u201d \u2014 for intelligent, innovative, and international. In 2009, Project i unveiled its first experimental vehicle, the Mini E. It wasn\u2019t elegant \u2014 the back seat of a conventional Mini had been removed to make room for batteries \u2014 but the car taught BMW about owner usage and battery life. One Mini E set a record at the time by traveling 147.3 miles on a single charge. Next came the ActiveE, which began U.S. field tests with 700 cars in January 2012. Based on the BMW 1 Series, it was more sophisticated than the Mini E, with seating for four and a thermal management system for improved battery performance.\n\nFor the third phase of Project i, BMW unveiled the i3 at the Frankfurt Auto Show in 2011. Developing it sent BMW into uncharted territory. For the carbon-fiber body, it formed a joint venture with an American company, SGL Automotive Carbon Fibers, and built a $100 million manufacturing plant in Moses Lake, Wash., to take advantage of hydropower from the nearby Grand Coulee Dam \u2014 sustainable power for a sustainable car. Raw material for the carbon fiber is shipped from Japan to Moses Lake, then sent to component makers in Wackersdorf and Landshut, Germany, and then on to Leipzig for final assembly.\n\nBMW figures the lifetime global-warming impact of the electric i3 is a third less than that of a similar-size diesel hatchback because of the use of carbon fiber for the body, recycled aluminum in the chassis, and interior panels and seats made out of hemp fibers, recycled water bottles, and the like. The Leipzig plant, which was expanded two years ago to accommodate the i3, runs on 100% renewable energy. Although the i3\u2019s electric powertrain weighs about 440 pounds more than a similar combustion setup, the car is 550 pounds lighter, thanks to its aluminum chassis and carbon-fiber body. The car needs eight seconds to get to 62 mph \u2014 tortoise time for a BMW \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop Ludwig Willisch, president of BMW North America, from exclaiming after a drive, \u201cIt looks great, and it goes like hell. It is a true BMW.\u201d\n\nBut the real innovation can be found in the passenger compartment. BMW calls i3 the world\u2019s first fully networked electric vehicle. The driver will be able to summon a mobile charging truck if his battery runs out. He will have smartphone apps to find charging spots, and the ability to swap into a gas-powered car. Operation of the navigation system, as well as the transfer of information among the vehicle, the outside world, and the driver\u2019s smartphone, has been tailored for city driving.\n\nIf the i3 is all about practicality and convenience, the i8 grand tourer sits at the opposite end of the mobility spectrum, where glamour and performance rule. Early i8 concepts featured two large pivot doors for access to both the front and rear seats, and laser headlights that are 10 times brighter than standard ones yet somehow don\u2019t blind oncoming drivers. The combined gas and electric motors of its hybrid drivetrain are said to whisk the 3,250-pound car to 62 mph in 4.6 seconds on the way to a top speed of 155 mph. For those with a lighter foot, fuel economy is figured at 104 miles per gallon. Deliveries begin in the first half of 2014.\n\nBMW\u2019s search for services and features to wrap around its i cars has taken it thousands of miles from Munich. For years automakers have used satellite design studios in Southern California to get a window on new trends. BMW has one, of course, but it also uses a technology office in Mountain View, Calif., where 40 professionals seek out, evaluate, and develop high-tech ideas. BMW has a beachhead on the East Coast too; it created its own New York venture capital operation in New York City and funded it with $100 million to invest in mobility services. Among its holdings is London-based Parkatmyhouse, which connects home and business owners who want to rent their parking spaces with drivers looking for a spot. Another is a California company called ChargePoint, the largest network of independently owned charging stations, operating in 14 countries.\n\nThere\u2019s more. If you own a BMW in San Francisco, the company offers a service called ParkNow that lets drivers find and book a parking spot in advance at off-street locations, as well as get information on related services, such as finding a car wash and renting a bike. Want to drive a BMW but don\u2019t own one? BMW has established DriveNow, a car-sharing service, in Munich, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, and San Francisco. Find a car on its website and pay per use; you\u2019ll be billed by the minute.\n\nAll this focus on the future does not mean that BMW is ignoring the present. The company easily met its financial targets for 2012, and propelled by strong sales in China and the U.S., the company expects to hit its target of 2 million in car sales in 2016, four years earlier than planned. Growth is coming from expanded offerings of small and compact cars like the 1 Series, and from BMW\u2019s ability to exploit product niches in existing segments. At the Paris Auto Show last fall it presented a short, chubby hatchback with a hybrid powertrain that it called the Active Tourer. About the same length as the 1 Series, the Active Tourer will share a front-wheel-drive platform with the Mini, making it the first BMW to come to market without the rear-wheel drive that enthusiasts prefer.\n\nConsidering the inability of Nissan and others to profit from electric vehicles, BMW\u2019s ability to sell them at premium prices is hardly a given. Fortunately, Reithofer can afford to be patient. Since 47% of its stock is owned by Munich\u2019s Quandt family, BMW essentially operates like a private company. When asked how soon BMW could expect a payoff from its i investments, Reithofer said the project had already been paid for, and \u201cif everything goes according to plan, we will earn a reasonable margin per vehicle and make money on every car.\u201d Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t build vehicles that are not profitable.\u201d\n\nA BMW supplier was overheard one day complaining that the company\u2019s standards make it a very difficult customer. \u201cEvery time we get to perfect, they change perfect,\u201d he said. The same might be said of BMW\u2019s long-term strategy. Besides continually refining the ultimate driving machine, BMW has taken on the additional challenge of creating the ultimate sustainable and plugged-in urban vehicle for the 21st century. It is big challenge for a small company, but then that is what makes BMW BMW.\n\nThis story is from the March 18, 2013 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 This week, I have bounced between decked-out department stores, cozy cafes, and speeding taxis, swiping my credit cards all along the way, more than 20 times in total. Despite the iPhone in my pocket \u2014 an Internet-connected device that can communicate, geolocate, and yes, pay for goods across the globe with one tap of the finger \u2014 each time I dug into my overstuffed wallet in search of my preferred form of payment: a plastic card with a magnetized strip.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m a fan of flash sale websites, lazily ordering dinner using Seamless, and Uber-ing all over town. But I\u2019m also always armed with plastic, which is why I was so excited when I saw the introductory video for Coin, the startup behind a card-shaped device that consolidates my many credit cards into a single, swipeable replacement. I\u2019m not alone: Based on the updates I\u2019ve seen recently in my Facebook newsfeed, my twentysomething friends are enthusiastic for it, too.\n\nFor several years, we\u2019ve had technology available to us that allows us to pay for goods with our smartphones, no wallet necessary. So why are we so excited for a product that seems like a step back \u2014 a clever, digital twist on an experience that otherwise hails from the 1950s?\n\nMORE: Electronic payments are paying off for Mexico\n\nKanishk Parashar has been wondering the same thing. In 2010, his company SmartMarket created a way for people to buy items from stores using their phones. Merchants could initiate a transaction using the SmartMarket mobile application \u2014 on an iPad used as a point-of-sale device, for example \u2014 and customers could confirm the transaction using their nearby mobile phones. The whole thing worked using geofencing technology and did away with that most persistent of shopping technologies: plastic cards.\n\nPlenty of people downloaded Parashar\u2019s app, but few were actually using it. \u201cI thought that was the future. It was pure mobile, with no need for plastic,\u201d Parashar recalls. Despite its buzzy reception, SmartMarket faced a chicken-and-egg problem: Merchants didn\u2019t want to replace their existing cash registers, and consumers didn\u2019t see merchants openly using it. It failed.\n\nParashar\u2019s newest venture, Coin, attempts to push payment tech forward without taking such a great leap. Like SmartMarket, Coin aims to further digitize payments. Unlike SmartMarket, Coin keeps the swipe-able card experience that people are used to. \u201cIt occurred to me that it\u2019s such a mass market with so many consumers [that] the only way to make something happen is when a single company can adopt something new to interact with something old,\u201d Parashar says.\n\nMORE: Say hello to the first (and second) crowdsourced credit card\n\nSquare, the mobile payments company founded by Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey and engineer-turned-entrepreneur Jim McKelvey, approached the problem with a similar mentality. Though smartphone adoption was rapidly increasing at the time of the company\u2019s founding, the two chose to use the connected devices as enablers, rather than replacements, of plastic cards. With simple-to-use software and a square-shaped dongle that plugs into a mobile device\u2019s audio port, vendors could process debit and credit card transactions in places without outlets.\n\nIt was a hit. \u201cIt\u2019s important to meet people where they are and not push them too far out of their comfort zones,\u201d Square spokesman Aaron Zamost says.\n\nThe lesson here? When it comes to changing user experience, incremental beats radical every time. That\u2019s why Square last year introduced Wallet, a SmartMarket-like mobile app, and Cash, a PayPal-like service that allows people to send their friends money via e-mail. Both services have been done before by companies such as Google GOOG and PayPal; the difference here is that Square took the time to acclimate its customers to digital payments before further removing elements of familiarity in the transaction process.\n\nMORE: The new power player in online payments\n\nYou might think that Coin, Square, and others threaten the dominance of leading credit card companies such as Visa V , MasterCard MA , and American Express AXP ; all three have made lackluster attempts at digital wallet technology in recent years. But the reality is that the Squares and Coins of the world can only exist because of credit card companies. They remain the connective tissue between consumers and merchants through a network of financial institutions, says Jim McCarthy, Visa\u2019s global head of innovation and strategic partnerships. Which means Coin, Square, and others are doing the hard work to change consumers\u2019 expectations, after which the entire industry benefits.\n\nWhich is why those credit card companies are less concerned with buying behaviors than they are with security. Years after they became standard in Europe, \u201cchip and PIN\u201d cards are slowly being deployed to cardholders in the U.S. Since Coin only uses magnetic strips \u2014 the company says it\u2019s currently working on \u201cchip card\u201d capabilities \u2014 McCarthy remains wary of supporting it.\n\n\u201c[Coin] is a bridge technology that uses mobile that I don\u2019t think anybody would think is a step forward,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a headscratcher. We\u2019ve seen these models before, and we haven\u2019t seen this kind of demand.\u201d He added that the Isis mobile payment system \u2014 a joint venture between AT&T T , T-Mobile TMUS , Verizon Wireless VZ , and one of Visa\u2019s partners \u2014 and similar services like Square Wallet and Paydiant are preferable because they allow shoppers to present a picture or QR code at the point of sale, which acts as a token that links to a card on file. The problem, of course, is that people aren\u2019t widely using this technology. At least not yet.\n\nMORE: Who\u2019s who in mobile payments\n\nIn October, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express proposed a new global standard for mobile payments. McCarthy says Visa will make tokens available for commercial use in April 2014 and believes the release will greatly increase face-to-face mobile transactions. The central challenge remains, however: Consumers and vendors today are confused by the diversity of payment options. When you buy a holiday gift, will you swipe, tap, snap, or wave? And which app will you choose to use?\n\nMcCarthy is optimistic: 2014 will be mobile payment\u2019s year, he says. Other players are more cautious. Erik Vlugt, VP of Product for Verifone, doesn\u2019t think that people are ready for a dramatic change, despite the continued hype around mobile payments. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that shift in our business,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s realistic to accept that all merchants will make that shift [in the near future]. High-end retailers maybe, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nPlayers in the space aren\u2019t worried. Whether Square, Isis, Paydiant, or something else, the raft of new payment technologies is helping everyone involved attract new customers and tap undeveloped markets that haven\u2019t traditionally used debit and credit cards in the past but are now saturated with mobile devices. \u201cMobile is the key to use doubling us in parts of world where they don\u2019t have cards,\u201d McCarthy says.\n\nSo where does that leave this holiday shopper? Back to basics. It\u2019s pretty clear that I\u2019ll be wearing out my magnetic strips for gifts this year, as I have for any other. But fingers crossed that there\u2019s a Coin waiting under the tree for me.",

According to the documents, businesses will only be able to send ads to users who are already conversing with them via the chat service, presumably a way to ensure that they are indeed interested in that business and its offerings.\n\nMessenger now has more than 800 million monthly active users, Messenger chief Dave Marcus revealed in January.\n\nAs a way to help businesses open those channels of communication (and advertising), the leaked documents reveal that Facebook FB has build a web URL short code custom to each business. When a user clicks or taps on the link, it opens a Messenger chat with that specific business. It\u2019s like a phone number, but for Messenger chats. Though Facebook isn\u2019t commenting on the short code, it is live at the moment, and it appears some businesses are already experimenting with it.\n\nThe fact that Facebook is requiring businesses to already have a conversation going with a user in order to send them an ads signals that the company is more than aware of how easily it could enrage its users. Messenger is already a fairly intimate communication tool (at least for a lot of people), and allowing businesses to spam users could be very damaging. This also means it could likely charge a lot for these ads given the highly targeted and direct context.\n\nNone of this is of course all that surprising. Facebook began to lay the groundwork almost a year ago when it announced at its annual developer conference in San Francisco that it would allow businesses to communicate with people and customers through Messenger. Since then, it\u2019s added features like a button on business pages that lets users send a message via Messenger to that business in order to facilitate those user-business communications.\n\nMessenger is also experimenting with \u201cchat bots,\u201d software programs that interact with users inside the messaging app similar to human conversations, which could help uses with shopping and booking services. Assist, for example, is one such bot available on Messenger, which touts itself as helping users handle everything from sending a flower delivery, to booking a hotel, and ordering an Uber or Lyft ride.\n\nA Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the advertising plans. It\u2019s also not clear whether it has similar plans for messaging app Whatsapp, which Facebook acquired for roughly $19 billion in early 2014, though Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said in the past that it\u2019s not a monetization strategy he believes is best suited to Whatsapp.",

Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat are some common mistakes young entrepreneurs make?\u201d is written by Karl Martin, founder and CTO of Nymi.\n\nWhen founding a new business, you have to accept that you might drop the ball sometimes. It\u2019s not about perfection, but rather about setting priorities and disciplining yourself to keep them. Do well at the things that will move the business forward, and for everything else, just don\u2019t make any fatal mistakes.\n\nHowever, this leads to a more macro-level challenge. As an entrepreneur, you\u2019re defining your business from the ground up. What business paths should you explore, and which are not worth your time? This has been a core challenge for me from the beginning. While my team and I have broadly applicable technology, we have to accept that we can\u2019t do everything. Having limited resources is the common variable that binds all startups.\n\nThe biggest mistake that I see many young entrepreneurs make is not clearly defining which opportunities they will target. This can be framed as a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat experiment for startups. In the classic thought experiment, physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger supposed that a cat could be simultaneously alive and dead if its fate was dependent on the unobserved state of a quantum system. As entrepreneurs, our number one driver is always achieving success for our ventures and keeping them alive. But a company\u2019s fate is dependent on an unknown: Which of the multitude of opportunities is the winning path? The decision is usually made with very limited information, leading to a highly uncertain outcome.\n\nSee also: This is why so many startups end up in financial trouble\n\nThe natural psychological response to this dilemma that many inexperienced entrepreneurs have is to simply not make a definitive choice \u2014 to run multiple options at the same time. But believing the cat is still alive somewhere in the flurry of activities is a fallacy. With limited resources, you risk running out of capital before achieving important proof points to keep the business alive.\n\nThe answer to this conundrum feels unnatural, but it involves making decisions quickly and resolutely with limited information. What\u2019s often not obvious is that if you move fast, you have greater opportunity to recover from mistakes and try another option should the first choice not pan out (also known as the classic startup \u201cpivot\u201d).\n\nIn the case of Nymi, we had originally positioned our wearable authentication product, the Nymi Band, as a consumer device. We pushed early with a pre-order campaign and got lots of invaluable market feedback. Before we even fully launched the product, the data showed us that the interest in our product was too broad across consumer applications and would be very hard to execute effectively. We decided to pivot and focus on enterprise use cases that allowed us to create a user experience centered around truly burning problems in the market.\n\nMany aspects of being an entrepreneur feel psychologically unnatural. Going fast and hard down a path with high uncertainty goes against our natural tendencies to mitigate risk. But avoiding failure simply leads to a slow death as your resources dry up. By making fast decisions and failing early, you realize that your cat may actually have a few lives to give.\n\nRead all responses to the Entrepreneur Insider question: What are some common mistakes young entrepreneurs make?\n\nThis is where most startups go wrong by Stephen Lake, CEO of Thalmic Labs.\n\nDoing these 3 things will destroy your startup by Michael Gasiorek, editor-in-chief of Startup Grind.\n\nThe avoidable mistake every entrepreneur makes by Andrew Filev, founder and CEO of Wrike.",

When people invite me to lunch, assign me work or read my column at the doctor\u2019s office, I assume it\u2019s because they love me unconditionally. But during my junior year at Stanford, I was bedeviled by insecurity. My girlfriend dumped me. My parents broke up. And the night they called to tell me, a girl pity-made-out with me, during which I leaned over my loft bed to put Peter Gabriel\u2019s Passion in my five-CD changer, fell to the floor and sliced my foot open on the net of the arcade football-tossing game I had stuffed into my dorm room to try to make friends.\n\nSo in 1992, when my friend Martha Brockenbrough, the editor of our school paper, used the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to force the admissions office to show students the comments it had jotted on our applications, I, in my ego-weakened state, signed up, desperate to find out what people liked about me. Afterward I wrote a column about the horrors I read, and shortly thereafter Stanford began a policy of shredding all applications. But now that applications are filled out online, the school once again has all the records stored, digitally. So once again, Stanford students are using the law to gain access to the notes on their applications. If journalism is the first draft of history and history is doomed to repeat itself, then I am doomed to write the exact same column I wrote in my junior year of college.\n\nI called the current student who forced Stanford to do this, in order to stop him or her. He or she started a funny email-only campus newsletter in September called the Fountain Hopper, which, he or she said, requires total anonymity on his or her part. Not because he or she is worried about getting in trouble with the administration, but because he or she is nervous about a satirical newsletter being the top Google result for the rest of his or her life.\n\nTo persuade him or her to reconsider, I told him or her the story of my own torture. Back in 1992, I walked into the admissions office, most likely unshowered, eating pizza and holding a book I\u2019ve still never read. I was led to a room with 11 other misguided souls and given 30 minutes with a folder that I was told I was never meant to see. For people clever enough to select the smartest kids in the country, the admissions office knew very little about reverse psychology.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the word swim circled in red. I was told that swim was Stanford\u2019s term for the pile for applicants whom the admissions committee disagreed about, left in the middle of the water awaiting their fate. The comments included \u201cHe could drive you crazy.\u201d \u201cNot appropriate.\u201d \u201cHormonal overdrive.\u201d And \u201cNot especially funny.\u201d The most encouragement I got for my swim, which was apparently across the English Channel, were two smiley faces. This was before emoticons were popular, so they were hand-drawn and, therefore, if it\u2019s possible, even more patronizing.\n\nI asked to see what I had written in my essay to cause this reaction. In response to the admittedly creepy prompt \u201cIs there anything else we should know about you?\u201d I wrote a \u201cTop 10 Other Things You Should Know About Joel Stein,\u201d which included, \u201cBabes will be coming in and out of the room so often it\u2019ll seem like the bus depot across the street from Barbizon.\u201d Way worse, an essay I wrote included the line \u201cI was using humour as a crutch; trying to hide some of my insecurities behind a barrage of jokes instead of facing my fears.\u201d If they wouldn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d have to drown myself. It\u2019s bad enough to speak with a fake British accent. It\u2019s unacceptable to spell with one.\n\nMy story, however, didn\u2019t convince the young man or woman leading current students to their downfall. Frustrated at the folly of overeducated youth, I took solace in the fact that at least I am no longer 20 and desperately seeking strangers\u2019 approval. Besides, now that I\u2019ve had a successful writing career, I\u2019m sure Stanford is thrilled it accepted me. Pretty sure. But it would be even better to find out.\n\nSo I tracked down the former admissions dean, Jean Fetter, while she was in Paris with her husband Steven Chu, the former Secretary of Energy and Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist, who was there as a keynote speaker at the opening ceremony of UNESCO\u2019s International Year of Light and was the one I actually bothered since his email was easier to find. Dean Jean wrote me right back, confirming my assumption that she too has been thinking about this for 25 years. \u201cIf you read your file you know I admitted you with foresight: \u2018This young man will make us all laugh while dispensing wisdom,'\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo yes I\u2019d do it again, although I\u2019m thankful not to be responsible for selecting 5% of 42,000 applicants of 2014 and can\u2019t guarantee how you would fare in those circumstances.\u201d Seriously, you never want to find out what people really think of you.\n\nI hope Stanford will shred its digital files and let students return to having no idea what their strengths and weaknesses are. Otherwise, someone else is going to find out they\u2019re not funny and waste their career desperately, annoyingly, inappropriately trying to prove otherwise.",

It's celebrated as the month during which Muhammad received the initial revelations that would become the Quran.\n\nDuring Ramadan, followers of Islam \u2013 Muslims \u2013 do not eat or drink (not even water) from sunrise to sunset, and try to abstain from impure thoughts or behavior. Daily fasts are to be broken by sharing meals with family or friends and at the end of the month, a three-day festival called Eid al-Fitr marks Ramadan's conclusion.\n\nIslam is the world's second-largest religion, after Christianity, with over 1 billion followers. An approximate 7 million Muslims call the United States their home;\n\n.

Ramadan is required of all Muslims puberty-aged and older, though the sick, elderly and women who are pregnant or nursing are exempt.\n\nIf you're looking to display some decent Ramadan etiquette as a non-Muslim, greetings are as follows: The standard Ramadan greetings are \"Ramadan kareem\" (which means \"have a generous Ramadan\") or \"Ramadan mubarak\" (which means \"have a blessed Ramadan\"). You'll be following in\n\n: Then-First Lady Hilary Clinton hosted the first Eid al-Fitr dinner at the White House in 1996. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W.

        "text": "When March Madness starts this week, playing the office pool offers a chance to win a year\u2019s worth of bragging rights and extra attention from the company brass. Unfortunately, not everyone is a college basketball expert, and even those who are rarely apply their expertise with the cold logic of Star Trek\u2019s Mr. Spock.\n\nThat\u2019s because, when it comes to filling out a March Madness bracket, there are a lot of behavioral biases at play. We all suffer from illusions of control, overreliance on experts, and something called affect heuristic, which pushes us to underestimate the risks of choices we like (for example, by playing down the pitfalls of choosing Temple because you\u2019re from Philly).\n\nWhile it can\u2019t tell us whether to choose Kansas over North Carolina or if Gonzaga will make a run, behavioral economics\u2014which studies the effects of psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors on decisions and their consequences\u2014at least offers a process for analyzing how and why people make decisions (like, say, bracket picks) and suggests ways to avoid common mistakes.\n\nThese same behavioral biases come into play in entrepreneurship. That\u2019s why, when sport commentators make March Madness picks, they often use metaphors related to the business world. They talk about ups and downs in a team\u2019s stock, recent performance \u201cstreaks,\u201d and confidence in company (team) leadership.\n\nSo now let\u2019s take a moment to look at how understanding behavioral economics can be essential in helping entrepreneurs become better business leaders\u2014and March Madness pickers.\n\nOf course, we all fall short of the idealized, fully rational \u201cEcons\u201d who populate traditional economic textbooks. Indeed, most of our decisions are driven by logically questionable narratives and mental heuristics that are better suited to dealing with risks in the savannah than in the C-suite or college basketball bracket.\n\nThese predictable human foibles are especially hazardous for entrepreneurs operating in a world where eight out of 10 businesses fail within the first 18 months. Research shows that those placing bets often fall victim to a sense of overconfidence. In one experiment conducted at a racetrack, gamblers were asked how confident they were in their bets either immediately before or after placing their bets; those polled afterward were significantly more confident in their choice than those asked beforehand. No wonder entrepreneurs and March Madness players are so optimistic about their chances of succeeding.\n\nAnother impediment to our ability to clearly assess risks is the so-called egocentric bias: We tend to believe that our preferences and opinions are representative of the general population\u2014\u201cIf I like Duke, many others must too\u201d\u2014even when they aren\u2019t.\n\nCompounding the problem, poorly structured teams can amplify such cognitive biases into the kind of groupthink that bedevils corporate cultures. For example, studies conducted by legal scholar Cass Sunstein reveal that a risk-seeking individual deliberating on a business decision will be even more willing to engage in risky behavior after talking with like-minded people\u2014even when contradictory information is available.\n\nThe good news for entrepreneurs\u2014and bracket pickers\u2014is that data science and well-structured teams can help us \u201cthink slower\u201d and ameliorate such cognitive biases. Analyzing historical data can help us recognize narrative fallacies and overconfident forecasts; input from a diversity of opinions can help overcome egocentric biases. And smart teams with self-silencing leaders, devil\u2019s advocates, clever opinion-aggregation mechanisms, and members with good social perception tend to take risks that are smart and calculated rather than foolish and intuitive.\n\nIn their book Nudge, Sunstein and behavioral economist Richard Thaler introduced the idea of \u201cchoice architecture\u201d\u2014small changes in the way options are presented that can have disproportionate impacts on the choices we make. This idea is taking the public-policy world by storm (President Obama signed an executive order for a White House \u201cnudge unit\u201d last September), and the private sector is beginning to tap into the power of choice architecture as well.\n\nTrue, the idea of choice architecture, particularly when implemented by a government agency, can seem like a creepy form of social engineering. But choice architecture\u2019s actual point is to help consumers more easily get to the choice that best serves them. Think of it this way: The mark of a well-designed computer or electronic gadget is that it can be immediately used without an instruction manual; its design is people-centric. Similarly, why not design choice environments for financial products or food choices to nudge our short-term selves toward the smart choices that our long-term selves would prefer?\n\nThere is a wide-open space for socially minded entrepreneurs to innovate product and service designs that go with, rather than against, the grain of human psychology. For example, even after years of research into choice overload, retailers still commonly present customers with too many choices\u2014for instance, offering 20 flavors of jam instead of five\u2014 which often leads to disengagement. This is all the truer when firms offer customers large menus of financial products, which, unlike arrays of jam flavors, require expert guidance, especially considering the long-term stakes.\n\nIn these situations, a choice-architecture option is to offer customers smaller, more personalized menus. This type of collaborative filtering is commonly used to help us choose books and movies\u2014why not healthy foods and winning teams as well? Another choice-architecture mechanism is the smart default, which has a proven track record in complex areas such as personal finance and health. Perhaps your 401(k) deferral, when you initially signed up, suggested a default amount for automatic enrollment. Or in the NCAA tournament, a bracket could come pre-filled with higher seeds winning all games, forcing the pool player to actively choose underdogs.\n\nAnother major theme of behavioral economics is that even the most disciplined executive procrastinates and struggles with limited self-control.

Multiply that by 100 when your startup has any tangential relationship to cannabis.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that it took Edward Woodford, co-founder of Seed Commodities Exchange, a commodities trading platform for industrial hemp, to send 11,000 emails, travel 46,238 miles, and meet with 604 investors to raise Seed CX\u2019s first round of funding. At one point, Woodford sent so many messages on LinkedIn that the service temporarily banned him.\n\nIt\u2019s also little surprise that when Seed CX finally secured its $3.42 million convertible note, announced today, many of the company\u2019s 50 investors declined to make their names public. The ones that it did include were lead investor Charlie O\u2019Donnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures, Darren Herman, Tom Sosnoff, 500 Startups, iAngels, Struck Capital, Ron Geffner, David Adler, Christopher Lee, and Julien Codorniou.\n\nThe problem is not that Seed CX operates in a legal gray area \u2014 the platform only operates in areas where hemp farming is federally legal \u2014 or that its legal risk is any higher than a disruptive company like Uber or Airbnb. It\u2019s that most investment funds have a \u201cvice\u201d clause, which forbids them from touching anything that sounds like drugs.\n\nA number of venture investors liked Seed CX enough to invest their personal money. Seed CX\u2019s investor list is rounded out by commitments from several trading platforms, Woodford says.\n\nSeed CX\u2019s commodities trading platform is powered by GMEX Technologies, a London-based subsidiary of financial technology company GMEX Group. Seed CX is awaiting regulatory approval by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The startup hopes to be up and running with its first commodities: hemp seed, whole hemp plant and whole hemp plant extract, by the time the farming season starts in May.\n\nThe market for commodities, which dwarfs the stock market, allows traders to buy and sell anything from precious metals like gold to farm products like soybeans. As the U.S. government cuts subsidies for tobacco, many farmers in Kentucky have begun growing and processing hemp. Currently there are around 100 hemp farmers in the U.S. and 150 hemp processors. (Hemp farming and processing is federally legal under the Agricultural Act of 2014, but only in states with the proper infrastructure, which currently includes Kentucky and 26 others. Hemp itself is legal everywhere.) Woodford would not disclose how many farmers and traders had signed up to use Seed CX when it launches.\n\nIf it gets regulatory approval, Seed CX will be the first trading platform for hemp. Many commodities trading platforms start out specializing in one type of commodity to maximize liquidity, Woodford says. From there, Woodford says Seed CX will expand into other \u201cnascent, illiquid\u201d commodities.\n\nWoodford believes commodities traders will be eager to trade hemp because they like unique, idiosyncratic risks of a new market with a complicated legal framework. Also, many traders believe that the longer they are in a market before it becomes mainstream, the more edge they have. Likewise, for hemp farmers and processors, a commodities market allows them to lock in prices with derivatives contracts.\n\nEven though hemp is made from cannabis, Woodford is not eager to be associated with the marijuana industry. \u201cThe perception of cannabis \u2014 sometimes it widens peoples\u2019 eyes and sometimes it narrows them,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, it is a real turnoff.\u201d That\u2019s part of the excitement behind Seed CX, but Woodford is careful to note that hemp is different from marijuana.\n\nSeed CX\u2019s fundraising struggle speaks to the broader business world\u2019s mix of fear and excitement around cannabis legalization. Few startups in the category have been able to raise venture capital from traditional institutional investors.",

The town, located five miles from the active volcano, was a popular destination for Rome's distinguished citizens thanks to the sunny coastline nearby. When the volcano exploded in 79 AD, 2,000 people were killed by poisonous gases, ash and crushed rocks.\n\nThe tragedy should have served as a warning to future generations, but fertile grounds and the beauty of islands have caused cities to pop up in the shadows of volcanoes. Many of the world's coolest destinations are actually in danger of becoming the next Pompeii.\n\nWilliam Menke, professor of Earth and Environmental studies at Columbia, identifies four cities as candidates for being threatened by the 'Most Dangerous Volcano in the World.' Seattle, Tokyo, Mexico City and Naples. The massive populations of the cities and suburbs relatively close to the mountains put them a risk of huge losses of life.\n\nClick below to see popular travel destinations that are secretly threatened by volcanoes:\n\nCities and vacation spots threatened by volcanoes\n\nThe idyllic Greek island's picturesque white houses are actually perched on overlapping shield volcanoes. In fact, the group of islands was entirely formed by volcanic activity. The eruption of Santorini in Greece in 1,650 B.C. was perhaps one of the largest witnessed by humans. The most recent eruption occurred in 1950, and there has been ongoing seismic activity ever since.\n\nThe southern Italian city is precariously located between Mount Vesuvius, and a lesser-known threat, the Campi Fiegrei caldera. The latter is a supervolcano that has been called 'the most potentially hazardous on the planet.' Its last eruption was just in 1538. There has been activity in recent years like earthquakes and parts of the caldera rising. If it were to erupt, the Campi Fiegrei would kill millions. But for now, it is just a tourist attraction like Naples\u2019 famous pizza.\n\nMount Rainier last erupted in the 19th century and has been closely watched by scientists ever since. U.S. Geological Survey has described Mount Rainier as 'an active volcano that will erupt again.' It is located about 58 miles southeast of Seattle, which may seem far, but suburbs and tourism surrounding the mountain put many at risk.\n\nMount Fuji has erupted at least 16 times since 781 A.D., with the most recent occurring in 1707-1708. In 2011, an earthquake caused geographic disturbances in Japan.\n\nFlorent Brenguier, a researcher at the Institute of Earth Sciences put out an ominous warning, stating \"our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it's in a critical state.\"\n\nLast year, Mount Fuji climbers were urged to wear helmets in case of an unexpected eruption.\n\nDramatic footage from April 2016 showed ash two miles high spewing out of Popocat\u00e9petl volcano in Mexico. As many as five daily explosions occurred in the beginning of July 2016. About 25 million people live within 62 miles of the crater of the stratovolcano, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMauna Loa is one of five large volcanoes that forms the Hawaiian islands. The whopping 60 mile-long volcano makes up nearly half of the entire island. Since 1832, Mauna Loa has erupted 39 times. According to USGS estimates, the volcano has erupted an average of once every 6 years over the past three millennia.\n\nMont Pel\u00e9e looms over this stunning French island in the Caribbean. It is a haunting reminder of the eruption of 1902, which wiped out the former capital of St-Pierre, known at the time as the \u2018Paris of the West Indies.\u2019 There were only two known survivors out of 28,000 in the town.\n\nDespite its tragic past, the island has become a hotbed of tourism again thanks to its beautiful beaches and French connection.\n\nUntil recently, tourists and amateur mountaineers in Ecuador were drawn to Cotopaxi, a quiet, snow-capped volcano only 34 miles away from the capital city. But in 2015, seismologists recorded hundreds of earthquakes and the volcano began to release a plume of ash. After 75 years of inactivity, the volcano now poses a threat to the millions who live nearby.\n\nAnd Cotopaxi isn\u2019t the only volcano threatening locals and tourists. There are at least six that foreign governments, like the U.K., are warning potential visitors about.\n\nThe iconic Tanzania mountain is comprised of three volcanic cones: Shira, Kibo and Mawenzi. The last major eruption from Kibo occurred 360,000 years ago, but minor volcanic activity happened 200 years ago. Although there has not been any recent activity, Kibo is dormant, not extinct, which still poses a risk to one of world\u2019s favorite places to climb.\n\nMore from AOL.com: A dead volcano in Rome has come back to life Amanda Steele reveals the 'craziest experience' she's ever had Budget better: 11 travel expenses that are always worth the splurge",

        "text": "In the aftermath of the horrible Friday the 13th attacks in Paris, many members of Congress quickly took the opportunity to blast the Obama administration\u2019s failure to appropriately counter ISIS in Iraq, Syria and beyond. It is fair game to challenge the administration\u2019s strategy, but these critiques miss an important point: Congress has abdicated its fundamental duty to debate, vote on and shape the extent of the current war on ISIS. Our post-Paris discussion about what more the U.S. should do must include Congress taking responsibility for our involvement, rather than trying to duck accountability.\n\nThe founders of our country crafted a constitution with a revolutionary idea about war. James Madison knew that war had been fundamentally a matter for the executive\u2014king, sultan, emir, emperor, monarch\u2014throughout human history. He determined that our nation would take the decision to initiate war away from the executive and instead vest it in the people\u2019s elected legislative branch. Absent an imminent attack on America, its people, or its national security interests, when the President as Commander-in-Chief can always act unilaterally to defend the country, we are not supposed to be at war without a vote of Congress.\n\nPresident Obama launched an airstrike campaign against ISIS on Aug. 8, 2014. In nearly 16 months of war, four American civilian hostages and 10 service members have been killed. Nearly 3,600 of our troops are deployed in the anti-ISIS mission today. We\u2019ve spent $5 billion and flown over 6200 airstrikes. And the ISIS threat has mutated beyond Iraq and Syria\u2014with obvious presence now in Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan and other nations. The attacks in Paris, with hundreds of innocent people killed and injured, occurred within days of ISIS claiming credit for a suicide bombing in Lebanon and the downing of a Russian passenger airliner in Egypt. And this week brings renewed threats of attacks on other cities, including Washington. ISIS is not going away.\n\nBut Congress has been strangely silent about the war. We criticize the President, but won\u2019t vote to authorize, stop or refine what he is doing. Congressional silence sends a message. Our allies wonder whether we have the resolve to work with them to stop this threat. ISIS must take comfort in the seeming ambivalence of Congress. Most damning, our troops\u2014ordered to risk their lives thousands of miles from home\u2014wonder whether Congress even supports the dangerous missions they must carry out every day.\n\nWe introduced a bill in June to spark a debate and get Congress to declare that ISIS is a sufficient threat to warrant American military action. We wanted to show that there could be bipartisan agreement on this point. A recent letter of 35 House members\u2014Democrat and Republican alike\u2014to Speaker Paul Ryan urges that Congress work together to put our imprimatur on using American military force against ISIS.\n\nThere are important questions to resolve going forward, especially the role\u2014if any\u2014of U.S. ground forces. Questions about whether to \u201csunset\u201d an ISIS-specific AUMF and what to do about the 14-year-old statute which currently serves as the administration\u2019s legal underpinning for action against ISIS, remain. None of them have easy answers, but we were not elected to the U.S. Senate to take votes on what\u2019s easy and avoid votes on issues that are hard. It is our responsibility to weigh in on this grave matter of foreign policy.\n\nA Congressional debate, at long last, about this war on ISIS will educate the American public about the stakes involved. It will force the administration to give thought to, and lay out a clear strategy that encompasses military and non-military dimensions\u2014including diplomatic and humanitarian measures\u2014for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIS, and for U.S. involvement with other nations in this struggle. It should let our troops, our allies and our adversaries know of our unity and resolve. Finally, it will vindicate the Constitutional role of Congress in making the sober decision about when military force is necessary.",

        "text": "Eileen Gray is the mystery figure of 20th-century modern architecture. How did the Irish-Scots aristocrat from Enniscorthy, County Wexford, become an originator of Parisian art deco? Even stranger, how, without any training as an architect, did she reinvent herself as one of the superstars of quite a different style, the architect of modernist buildings of a reticence so powerful they take the breath away? The answer must lie in Gray's exceptional contrariness as a woman and as an artist. \"To create,\" she once said, \"one must first question everything.\"\n\nThere is a sense of metamorphosis in Gray's work. Her rooms are designed to be flexible, impermanent, responsive to the demands of the moment. Screens can be shifted to redefine the spaces. Little drawers pivot outwards to reveal their inner contents. A storage cupboard drops down to provide a writing surface. A mirror is suspended on a pole that swivels. All is movement, realignment, possibility.\n\nThe same is true of Gray's life. She was a springer of surprises. To start with, Gray, who took the lead in redefining architecture as a plausible profession for her sex, derives her surname not from her father but her mother, who in 1895 inherited the Scottish title Baroness Gray in her own right. Her father changed his name to Smith-Gray by royal licence and the four children were from then on known as Gray.\n\nThe unlikeliness continues with her choice of lacquer-making, an obscure oriental art that is technically hard to master, at a time when her contemporary craftswomen were concentrating on more conventional pursuits: bookbinding, weaving, embroidery, jewellery making. Nor was Gray ever involved in the arts and crafts guilds or supportive female groupings of the early 1900s. She always worked alone, and this fastidious apartness was the basis of her originality.\n\nShe studied at the Slade School of Design, but did not stay in England long. She had a wonderful ability to pack up and leave with no sentimental waverings. Gray had first gone to Paris in 1901, with two friends from the Slade, to take classes in drawing and returned to Paris permanently five years later, moving into the apartment in rue Bonaparte that she kept all her life. She was soon more Parisian than the Parisians, developing a style of decoration that came to be seen as quintessentially French.\n\nEileen Gray's work in Paris before the first world war is rarefied, exotic. She developed her skills in lacquer through meeting and learning from a young Japanese craftsman, Seizo Sugawara, who came from Jahoji, a village in northern Japan famous for its lacquer work. Gray filled her notebooks with colour recipes and methods of applying and layering the lacquer, seeing how she might draw on these ancient techniques to create a modern art form. Her screens and panels are abstract, with complex, swirling forms. The most marvellous of these, Le Destin (1914), is a four-fold screen in deep red lacquer on which a mysterious drama is enacted between two blue-grey naked youths and an old man wrapped in a misty silver shroud. Le Destin was acquired by the couturier Jacques Doucet, bibliophile and modern art collector, an early admirer of Gray's work.\n\nAfter the war her interiors still tended to the sumptuous, though never to the vulgar. Gray's art deco was never lush or louche. She had a deeply moral disapproval of the overdone, covering over the \"disgraceful mouldings\" in the apartment in the Rue de Lota she was commissioned to design for Madame Mathieu L\u00e9vy, who, as Suzanne Talbot, was one of the most fashionable modistes in Paris at the time. Gray had been excited by Bakst's designs for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, and the salon in the L\u00e9vy apartment is her own Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade, a finely judged ensemble of lacquered panels, matt gold cushions, a red lacquer serpent chair and one of her most beautiful designs, the Pirogue boat-bed, burnished like a barque for Cleopatra in lacquer and silver leaf. (The Pirogue was the show-stopper in the V&A museum's art deco exhibition of 2003.)\n\nVery little is known of Gray's emotional life. Characteristically, she burnt all letters and personal mementoes in old age. But it seems that from her early years in France, Gray was on the fringes of the raffish intellectual Paris-Lesbos scene. She had a long, close friendship with Gaby Bloch, companion-manager of the American Marie Louise Fuller, alias Lo\u00efe, of twirling dance celebrity. She was later to be seen swanning around with Damia, the green-eyed, gravel-voiced singer whose popular \"chansons dramatiques et tristes\" had made her the Edith Piaf of her day. Gray escorted Damia to restaurants and nightclubs, elegant in her Poiret evening coats and Lanvin hats. She knew Nathalie Barney, Romaine Brooks and Gertrude Stein. But she never quite joined up with the Caf\u00e9 Flore society of Americans in Paris. They were probably too raucous. The American photographer Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bonney recalled Gray's extreme inwardness: \"Of all the people I knew in the world, she gave the feeling of complete consecration.\"\n\nGray's rebirth as total modernist began in the mid-1920s. By now she had opened her own shop in Paris, in the fashionable Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9. The shop was called Gal\u00e9rie Jean D\u00e9sert, the name of an invented male proprietor and reference to Gray's then-recent desert travels in north Africa with the weaver Evelyn Wyld. A female furniture designer in Paris was a rarity, but a cognoscenti customer base of writers, politicians, artists and architects was gradually created. Jean D\u00e9sert sold the abstract geometric rugs designed by Gray and woven in Wyld's Rue Visconti workshops.\n\nHer evolution was now recognised by other European modernists. Gray had her first major public showing in the Salon des Artistes D\u00e9corateurs in 1923. Although the sombrely sophisticated Bedroom-Boudoir de Monte Carlo was described by one critic as suitable for Dr Caligari's daughter, Gray was heartened to receive an enthusiastic postcard from the Dutch modernist architect JP Oud, a founder of De Stijl. Her subsequent display at the Salon d'Automne was praised by her fellow exhibitors Le Corbusier and Robert Mallet-Stevens. In 1924 the Dutch avant-garde magazine Wendingen referred to her as being \"at the centre of the modern movement\". She was seen as a designer with new visions for the future, demonstrating that \"the formidable influence of technology has transformed our sensibilities\".\n\nGray was the model of the self-made architect: \"I started really by myself, sort of making plans of buildings.\" Her architecture evolved without the training or the tradition of the large office. She was never the woman in the shadow of the maestro, as Charlotte Perriand was with Le Corbusier or Lilly Reich with Mies van der Rohe. Her first house, named cryptically E-1027, was designed in collaboration with and indeed for her sometime lover, Jean Badovici, the Romanian architect and writer. But she did not allow him to get the upper hand. The plan was credited to \"Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici\". When the design was shown in a later exhibition as the work of Badovici with furnishings by Gray, on the assumption that women were by nature merely choosers of the curtains, she was understandably enraged.\n\nE-1027 was built on the cliffs at Roquebrune, a clear white L-shaped house of exquisite simplicity. The south of France was then a favoured place for modernists, with its wild coast scenery and connotations of escape. Gray had loved the Riviera since she first discovered St Tropez, then quite undeveloped, on her early travels before the first world war. E-1027 developed as a \"living organism\", like the flora and fauna burgeoning around it. The furnishings were integral to the architecture, in Gray's apparently casual seaside \"camping style\". Most of the furniture for which Gray is now so famous - the Bibendum chair, the Transat chair - was designed for the new house. The E-1027 circular glass table, adjustable in height by means of a sliding pole, was evolved for Eileen's sister, who liked breakfasting in bed.\n\nThough E-1027 was startlingly modern in its day, Gray was never a doctrinaire modernist. She stood apart from the dogmatic male dominated Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). What she achieved was different, and it was her own. Colin St John Wilson, architect of the British library and a Gray aficionado, has defined her \"unique gift for turning the practical into the poetic\", her intense \"perceptions of habitability\". Gray took the forms of modernism and invested them with a perfectionist tendresse. In the hall of E-1027, \"Entrez Lentement\" was spelled out with a kind of gentle jokiness. When she used industrial materials it was with the lightest touch. This makes all the crasser Le Corbusier's later desecration of E-1027 by painting nine large, lewdly coloured frescoes on the pristine walls, an act Gray called violation. Le Corbusier reputedly added insult to injury by painting in the nude.\n\nBetween 1932 and 1934 Gray built her own house, Tempe \u00e0 Pailla, nearby at Castellar. She and Jean Badovici had by now parted. Gray continued planning buildings but little materialised.\n\nIt was only in the 1970s that Gray was rediscovered. Retrospectives in London and New York revealed her as a designer of intrepid intelligence. She attracted younger fans, among them Bruce Chatwin, who tracked her down in Paris. He remarked on two gouache maps of Patagonia she had painted on the walls of her apartment. Gray, by then old, blind and fragile, said: \"Go there for me.\" When Chatwin returned, he wrote In Patagonia. Gray died in 1976 at the age of 98.\n\nCan we really consider her as one of the giants of modernism on the strength of just two buildings? Gray herself, who regarded her late fame with a charming cynicism, would have said: \"Mais c'est absurde.\" Yet her vision of the future - \"the future projects light, the past only shadows\" - was compelling. She humanised the architectural world. We need to see her as the precursor of such solo women architects as Eva Jiricna and Zaha Hadid. View Gray in broader terms as the builder of the home, literally the homemaker, and you have a potent image for the dawning feminism of the mid-20th century.\n\n\u00b7 An exhibition of Eileen Gray's work is at the Design Museum, London SE1, from September 17.

She designed two famous houses, E-1027 and Tempe \u00e0 Pailla, which showcased her unique style and approach to modernism. Gray's work was rediscovered in the 1970s, and she is now considered a giant of modernism, paving the way for solo women architects and feminist design.",

        "text": "Consumer Reports recommends following these seven spending rules to avoid breaking the bank this holiday season:\n\n1. Thou shalt manage receipts. You might need them for proof of purchase for warranties or to make a return. Have a designated place to unload paper receipts after a day of shopping, such as an envelope in a kitchen drawer. For online purchases, save receipts and confirmation e-mails in a computer folder. If you give gift receipts, tell recipients the value, so they get a fair exchange. If you give a gift card, provide the receipt. It will be needed to replace a lost or stolen card.\n\n2. Thou shalt use credit cards. Credit cards provide top fraud protection, and if your credit card is a rewards card, you get rebates and other goodies. Be strategic. Some cards offer extra points or cash back at different times. For instance, from October through December, the Chase Freedom card offers 5 percent back on up to $1,500 in purchases from Amazon.com, Zappos.com, and select department stores.\n\n3. Thou shalt keep track of rebates. Plan carefully if you\u2019re counting on rebates on anything you give as a gift. You\u2019ll probably need to submit the UPC symbol, which could be a problem if the recipient takes or destroys the packaging. If you apply for the rebate before you give the gift, you risk losing your right to return the item. Figure out what you need to do ahead of time.\n\nMake a list of rebate-eligible gifts and filing deadlines. For example, to obtain a $30 Visa prepaid card after purchasing a Kitchen Aid Diamond blender, you must buy the product by Dec. 31 and send the completed rebate form, UPC code, and a copy of the receipt by Jan. 31.\n\n4. Thou shalt not take on debt. Make a budget and stick to it. Don\u2019t be enticed by retailer special offers that provide no-interest financing for a year or more. There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be able to repay all you owe by the deadline. If you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to pay back the interest that has accrued during the \u201cinterest free\u201d period.\n\n5. Thou shalt not fall victim to the hype. Just because it\u2019s Black Friday or an item is 50 percent off doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a top deal. In a 2011 study, a price prediction website found that more than a quarter of TVs and cameras recommended by Consumer Reports were at least 5 percent cheaper after Black Friday weekend. Don\u2019t assume you get the best deals by buying at a particular time or event.\n\n6. Thou shalt not become a target. Avoid theft by withdrawing cash only from ATMs in public places or inside your bank. Avoid giving your e-mail address or phone number to walk-in stores unless you welcome incessant marketing. Check out as a guest when shopping online. If the online retailer asks you to check a box indicating you want them to retain your credit card info, don\u2019t do it. Investigate retailers you\u2019re unfamiliar with by searching the Web and looking for a Better Business Bureau reports. Read sites\u2019 privacy policies and terms of service.\n\n7. Thou shalt not give gift cards. Though federal gift card protections have improved, gift cards remain a hassle. Store cards can be used only at the issuing retailer and might be nonrefundable if they\u2019re lost or stolen, as with Red Lobster and Olive Garden gift cards. Bank cards usually have fees. Simon Mall Visa gift cards cost $5.95 to purchase and charge $2.95 monthly if a balance remains after 13 months. What\u2019s wrong with cash?",

Shares of HP, which plans to split into two companies later this year, took a beating in after-hours trading. Here are the key points of Tuesday\u2019s quarterly earnings report.\n\nWhat you need to know: HP\u2019s first-quarter revenue of $26.8 billion was down from the $28.2 billion the company posted during the same period last year. The tech giant\u2019s sales came up short of the $27.4 billion that analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters. HP\u2019s profits fell nearly 4% to $1.4 billion, or 75 cents per share.\n\nHP said it overcame problems from the strengthening U.S. dollar overseas in the most recent quarter, adding that its first-quarter revenue was down just 2% when exchange rate fluctuations were taken into consideration. But the company also offered a disappointing forecast for the current quarter, warning that currency changes could have \u201ca significant impact\u201d on those upcoming results.\n\nHP\u2019s shares HPQ fell nearly 7% in after-hours trading following the disappointing earnings report. The company\u2019s stock price is up just 2% since November, when HP reported a fourth-quarter sales decline after its first quarterly sales gain \u2014 during the third quarter \u2014 in roughly four years.\n\nThe big number: Sales for HP\u2019s business services unit fell 11% in the fourth quarter, to $4.9 billion, which contributed to the company\u2019s disappointing performance overall. Meanwhile, sales were flat for both the PC business and its Enterprise Group, which includes cloud computing.\n\nSales in HP\u2019s desktop PC business, which accounts for about 30% total revenue, declined 10% after showing some improvement in 2014. Sales of laptops improved 9% to make up the bulk of that business.\n\nOverall, the PC and printing businesses saw sales decline 1.8%, to $14.1 billion. HP said in September the PC and printing businesses would split off into one company while its corporate hardware and services businesses would go into another.\n\nWhat you might have missed: Many analysts hope that HP\u2019s earnings call with CEO Meg Whitman Tuesday evening will provide more details about the pending split \u2014 including how, exactly, the company plans to divvy up its cash and debt between the two new companies. HP did include $80 million in separation costs in its first-quarter earnings report, as well as another $146 million in restructuring charges.\n\nWhitman also said in a statement that her ongoing turnaround plan for HP, which she has said will be completed by 2016, \u201cremains on track.\u201d",

        "text": "Peter Doig Tate Britain, London SW1, until 27 April\n\nThe Peter Doig retrospective now filling several galleries at Tate Britain is easily the most enthralling show in town. Its achievement is to mystify even as it compels. Doig's paintings have always been singular - narcotic, yet intensely stimulating, beautiful yet way out on a limb - and they seem to grow more original and mesmerising by the year.\n\nA perpetual outsider, born in Scotland in 1959 but raised in Canada, then an expatriate in London and now Trinidad, Doig didn't show much until he was 30. But if he was a late starter, a few years older than the YBA generation with whom he studied, he survived the manic star-making of the Nineties by constantly deepening his art and the early paintings set the scene for the future. Frequently snowbound - ski-slopes, icy forests, deep drifts settling on the canvas or arriving like hale in twinkling spatters - they often included the lone figures that have come to symbolise his work.\n\nA boy on a frozen pond studies his reflection in the mauve-rippled surface, the paint - flecked, scribbled, stained, perilously thin - as unstable as the ice. A hooded figure in a mountain landscape turns his back to us, apparently sketching something we can't see but ominous as the dwarf in Don't Look Now. A man by the river's edge at twilight, the car headlights on behind him as if he might yet return to reality, is either mesmerised by the weird phosphorescence on the water or about to do away with himself.\n\nAt another bend in the river drifts the canoe Doig has painted over and again like some deathless Raft of Medusa. A very early craft, unmanned, appears on an inky expanse that holds the reflection of the Milky Way with the eerie brightness of a basalt mirror. Another, becalmed on a stretch of burning blue, carries a bearded man who could as easily be Charles Manson or the Ancient Mariner, time having stopped like this vessel without oars; the picture is called 100 Years Ago. And out in the beating heat of the West Indian bay, palm trees all around, five spectral figures float away into the future. Or is it the past? One of them looks strangely like the young Paul McCartney.\n\nEvery scene suggests an id\u00e9e fixe, some sight or experience perpetually trapped in the mind that can never be exorcised. Doig's gift is for making these memories seem not just his own, but the viewer's as well, as if we, too, could not forget these peculiar moments in films, novels or scenes skimmed from life with a camera that keep flashing back on the mind's eye.\n\nThe slow and distanced trance that characterises Doig's art comes in part from his use of the camera. Stills and snapshots and even album covers (the bearded man started out as a member of the Allman Brothers) form an aide-m\u00e9moire, a departure point.\n\nBut the memories - not necessarily his own in the first place, and chosen with exceptional instinct for the universal - are obscured, overlaid, blended, corroded, lost and found again, quite altered, in the paint. You can see that happening, both literally and metaphorically, as figures on a shoreline darken into shadows behind flurries of snow accumulating on the canvas like aerosol graffiti, or in a vast diptych showing hundreds of skiers on the slopes. The people are melting into the snow, itself deliquescing into a pink twilight as if the sky had overwhelmed the earth below.\n\nDoig holds back the oblivion, every time, with a strong depictive touch. A painting that looks on the verge of abstraction will be held together with precise description - the puckering of water, the piebald dappling of sunshine, a striation of reeds along a riverbank that looks like a drawing catching fire: just enough to keep the scene plausibly real, before releasing it into the dreamy wilds. And they are quite wild, his paintings, veering between enchantment and fear. Who is this man who turns to meet your gaze with a dying pelican in his hand? Where is this wall apparently studded with jewels at which two costumed figures stand sentry beneath a performance of the Northern Lights? How did the little girl in the white pyjamas climb so high in that midnight tree? Doig seeks to fix in your mind whatever haunted his from the wondrous strangeness of the visible world.\n\nBut he never lets you forget the strangeness of picturing itself - that a painting, unlike a photograph, is never really still and, in his case, quite the reverse. The whole surface of a Doig is a micro-life of incidents - focus pulls, jumps in scale, skittering-scattering brushmarks, encrusted impasto, veiled blurs and cross-fades, the leaching and streaking of paint, abrupt discontinuities between psychedelic colours and severe monochromes that seem to belong only to the world of painting.\n\nLately, it's been suggested, the paint is taking over altogether and it might seem so when you consider the apparently empty expanse of an enormous canvas like Untitled 2006. But look closer into the wash of paint, thin as watercolour, and you'll see a figure high up a palm tree, a bird soaring across the pulsating lilac light and, as your eyes adjust, the spectral trace of an interloper: a stranger in paradise.\n\nIf his art was always a bit trippy, reamed out with visions, it now approaches the hallucinatory: winged figures, hot shores, the canoe vanishing into the pale horizon. But Doig's style, by contrast, gets more disciplined by the year. His art is becoming grander and more formal with the decades, his latest paintings composed as distinctively as anything by Bonnard or Matisse.\n\nThere are no false notes, the great scale is perfectly judged to hold all the perceptual incidents and maintain the balance between narrative and image. For in the end, no matter how much they invite interpretation, propose a backstory or riddle with the viewer's sense of mystery, Doig's paintings are about mood and atmosphere above all else. His great gift is for altering our state of mind through the mind's eye, for getting out of this world by inventing another through painting.",
        "generated": "The Peter Doig retrospective at Tate Britain in London is a mesmerizing show that showcases the artist's unique style and ability to create paintings that are both beautiful and unsettling. Doig's work is characterized by a blend of realism and abstraction, with a focus on the mysterious and the unknown. His paintings often feature lone figures in landscapes, and the use of color and light creates a sense of atmosphere that is both captivating and unnerving. The exhibition includes a range of works from Doig's career, including early paintings that showcase his use of the camera as a source of inspiration, as well as more recent works that explore the hallucinatory and the surreal. Overall, the retrospective is a must-see for fans of Doig's work and for anyone interested in contemporary art.",

Likewise, the new Los Angeles city rule will not apply to the L.A.-area municipalities of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Burbank and Santa Monica.\n\nThere are also other exemptions to the new law, which will be phased in starting July 1, 2015, at hotels with more than 300 rooms, and on July 1, 2016, at hotels with at least 150 rooms. Hotel owners can argue for a one-year exemption if an audit shows it would cause bankruptcy or worker layoffs in excess of 20 percent or an overall hours reduction of 30 percent. The council also called for a study to determine whether historic hotels should also be exempt.\n\nEarlier versions of the ordinance would have applied to hotels with as few as 100 rooms, and then 125 rooms. The final version that came out of committee Monday put forth the phased-in 300-room and 150-room plan. \"It's diminished quite a bit,\" to the point that the raises may apply to maybe only 6,000 people, Amano said.\n\nRead MoreDo tips perpetuate unfair wages for workers?\n\nStill, supporters have argued that a $15.37-an-hour wage will make a big difference to those employees who get it. \"That's about the minimum you could be paid and not have to rely on public assistance\" in the city, Leigh Shelton, spokeswoman for the UNITE HERE hotel workers union in Los Angeles, told CNBC earlier this month.\n\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association, which represents hotel owners, chains, and suppliers, has pledged to fight wage hikes like these, which it has dubbed an \"extreme minimum wage.\"\n\nRead MoreThe real problem with raising the minimum wage\n\nThe hotel industry has said it's exploring its legal options over the new minimum wage, but Paul Sonn, the general counsel at the National Employment Law Project wage advocacy group, said they're not likely to win since the 2008 airport-area law was already upheld by the California Supreme Court.\n\nSome have argued that the hotels are fair game because they receive government subsidies and can pass along needed increase to non-locals. \"Hotels are both uniquely subsidized and uniquely taxed,\" states a report to the council from the Economic Roundtable. \"Cities have long recognized the need to stimulate tourism and have supported hotels in order to achieve that goal, for example, by building convention centers, which are often loss leaders, supporting marketing through convention and visitors bureaus and by directly subsidizing the construction of new hotels or the renovation of existing hotels. Many of Los Angeles's hotels have been built with such supports over the years.\"\n\nSince Wednesday's 12-3 vote in Los Angeles was not unanimous, the same council members will reconsider the matter Oct. 1, but the approval is likely to be just a formality since only a simple majority of eight is required for passage.",

        "text": "Forty years ago this week, the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach President Richard Nixon. Never comfortable with the media, Nixon made no attempt to hide his true feelings about reporters (especially Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post) or where he thought the blame belonged for his downfall: \"It's the responsibility of the media to look at the president with a microscope, but they go too far when they use a proctoscope.\"\n\nMany U.S. presidents have shared Nixon's exasperation with the press. Theodore Roosevelt coined the term \"muckraker\" during a speech in 1906. He compared investigative reporters to the narrow-minded figure in John Bunyan's 17th-century religious fable, \"The Pilgrim's Progress\": the \"man that could look no way but downwards, with a muckrake in his hand.\"\n\nThe idea of reform-minded journalism existed long before Roosevelt complained about its alleged excesses. The two fathers of modern journalism, Richard Steele and Joseph Addison, started the Spectator in 1711 with the explicit aim of informing, educating, entertaining and reforming British society. The 10th issue had \"Mr. Spectator\" declare: \"I shall endeavor to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit with Morality.\"\n\nThe British press started to flex its political muscles in the 1770s, when the gadfly John Wilkes fought the government for the right to publish parliamentary debates. Wilkes's campaign led to mass marches, riots and even a stint in prison for him. Nevertheless, he succeeded in establishing the freedom of the press to report on politics. Emboldened, the major London newspapers began to regard themselves as the \"fourth estate\"\u2014a power in their own right. The Times of London became known as \"the Thunderer\" after one of its editorials began: \"We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform.\"\n\nWhen the world's first war correspondent, William Howard Russell, came to the U.S. to report on the Civil War, his brand of nonpartisan, investigative journalism irritated many Americans. But in 1871, a mere 10 years later, the U.S. press was going after the corrupt and the vicious with unbridled confidence. Among their first targets were William \"Boss\" Tweed of Tammany Hall and the graft-taking congressmen in the Credit Mobilier railroad scandal.\n\nThe Progressive Era, from the 1890s to the 1920s, was a golden age for crusading journalism, including The Wall Street Journal's 1922 revelation of bribery and collusion among the Harding administration and California oil barons. The first undercover reporter seems to have been Elizabeth Jane Cochrane, writing under the pseudonym Nellie Bly.\n\nIn 1887, Bly feigned madness to have herself committed to the women's insane asylum on New York's Blackwell's Island. After 10 harrowing days in which Bly witnessed incredible scenes of torture, deprivation and psychological cruelty toward the inmates, some of whom weren't mentally ill at all, a lawyer from Bly's paper, the New York World, secured her release. Bly's subsequent report helped to bring sweeping changes to the asylum.\n\nFifteen years later, Ida Tarbell began her groundbreaking expos\u00e9 for McClure's magazine of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly. Tarbell's 1904 book, \"The History of the Standard Oil Company,\" helped result in the company being broken up under the 1911 Sherman Anti-Trust Act. A second Ida, the African-American journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, risked her life to bring the horror of Southern lynch mobs to the world's attention. She became a founding member of the NAACP in 1909.\n\nThe muckrakers haven't always received their due from history. But as Joseph Addison joked, being relegated to yesterday's news is an occupational hazard: \"We are always doing something for posterity, but I would fain see posterity do something for us.\"",

She has learned how to flee for shelter during air strikes and witnessed the tragic deaths that follow. But this summer, she shifted gears to tell a story a little closer to home\u2014in her own backyard in Windom, Minnesota, where she used to take summer jobs as a rock picker.\n\n\u201cIt was super fun and you got a great tan and you got to get dirty,\u201d she says. \u201cI would pack a lunch and hang out on a flatbed trailer connected to a 1950s John Deere tractor with my friends.

The region\u2014the remains of a prehistoric glacial zone\u2014still has rocky deposits in its soil. So, every year before corn harvest, the soil is tilled and everything below comes to the surface, including rocks, which can damage crops and equipment. Having planted their crops ahead of corn season in June, farmers need to get rid of these pesky disturbances.\n\nRock picking is a minimum wage-paying, high-energy job for kids who are out of school for the summer, Potter says. \u201cThey have nothing else to do, and their parents see it as a way to keep them busy.\u201d\n\nPotter\u2019s images capture the rolling cornfields of Murray County, Jackson County and Cottonwood County. They show the day-long process pickers go through. Some farmers are pickier than others about the size of the rocks that need to be removed \u2013 it varies from fist size to arm\u2019s length. Those too large to carry are flagged for others to get later. Many of the rocks are sold for landscaping.\n\nGrowing up in small town Windom, Minnesota, Potter says she was always restless. \u201cI always felt different, out of place,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to distance myself a bit.

And I\u2019m proud of where I came from.\u201d Her work is an attempt to make life in a small town in Minnesota a little more relatable. \u201cSome people tell me they thought farms didn\u2019t exist anymore, or they have a very provincial view of what farming is,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope people can see this is one slice of rural America that was important to me at a certain time and is still important to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAlex Potter is a photographer based in the Middle East.\n\nRachel Lowry is a writer and contributor for TIME LightBox.

But are they any better off?\n\nThis has been the central question as we\u2019ve been watching the complex and expensive health law unfurl. We knew the law was giving people coverage, but information about whether it\u2019s protecting people from debt or helping them become more healthy has been slower to emerge.\n\nA few recent studies suggest that people have become less likely to have medical debt or to postpone care because of cost. They are also more likely to have a regular doctor and to be getting preventive health services like vaccines and cancer screenings. A new study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers another way of looking at the issue. Low-income people in Arkansas and Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid insurance to everyone below a certain income threshold, appear to be healthier than their peers in Texas, which did not expand.\n\nThe study took advantage of what Dr. Benjamin Sommers, an author of the paper and an assistant professor of health policy and economics at Harvard, called \u201ca huge natural experiment.\u201d\n\nIn its 2012 ruling, the Supreme Court made the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion optional for states. The resulting variation in choices makes it much easier to compare what happened in different states and draw conclusions about what effects health insurance coverage might have for the finances and health of Americans.\n\nThe researchers gathered their results by conducting a large telephone survey of low-income residents of the three states. They asked the same questions three times: in 2013, before the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion; at the end of 2014, after it had been in place for a year; and at the end of last year. Then they compared what happened over time, using Texas as a kind of control group to see how much of a difference the Medicaid expansions in the other two states made.\n\nTheir survey found people in Arkansas and Kentucky were nearly 5 percent more likely than their peers in Texas to say they were in excellent health in 2015. And that difference was bigger than it had been the year before.\n\nNo two states are exactly the same, of course. There are many differences between Texas, Arkansas and Kentucky, besides their decisions on this part of the Affordable Care Act. The authors cautioned that their results can\u2019t prove that Medicaid expansion caused people to be healthier.\n\nThere are differences between Arkansas and Kentucky as well. Kentucky expanded Medicaid in a more conventional way, while Arkansas tried an innovative expansion, offering its low-income residents private insurance. But the study found only small differences between the two approaches.\n\nThat finding may be of interest to states that have not expanded yet but are considering it. Louisiana this summer became the 31st state to expand its program, using an approach more like Kentucky\u2019s. And Kentucky\u2019s governor has considered revamping the program there to make it more like Arkansas\u2019s.\n\nIt might sound simple to measure whether people are healthier than they used to be, but it\u2019s actually pretty tough. While tests can tell you whether someone has high cholesterol, say, or high blood pressure, a single test may not tell the whole story. It turns out, however, that if you ask people how healthy they are, they do a pretty good job of telling you. Extensive research shows that people who say they are in poor health really are much more likely to die soon than those who describe their health as good.\n\nThe survey also asked about other subjects. It found that people in the expansion states were more likely to have a doctor and to have a place to go for care. They said they were more likely to have their chronic disease treated, and that they were more likely to have received screening for high cholesterol or high blood sugar, markers for heart disease and diabetes.\n\nOn financial measures, the study was in line with some previous studies, finding that people in Kentucky and Arkansas were less likely to postpone care or avoid taking prescribed drugs because of the cost, and that they were less likely to be struggling with a medical bill.\n\nOn almost all measures in the survey, the size of the difference between Texas and the other states was bigger in 2015 than it was in 2014. That trend makes some sense: Once you get health insurance, it might take a while before you start getting health care, and even longer before you\u2019ll start getting healthier (optimistically assuming that you do). But the trend suggests that we may need to wait some time in evaluating the health law\u2019s effects before we really know how big they are.\n\nA famous experiment of low-income people in Oregon tracked one group that won a lottery to receive Medicaid coverage and another that remained uninsured. That study found that people who got insurance were much more likely than their uninsured peers to describe themselves as having good or excellent health. People who got health insurance in that experiment were also more financially secure. But the experiment did not show big changes in some key physical health measures in people they studied, like blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\nThe Oregon study followed those people only for two years. It\u2019s possible that, given more time, those people might have shown signs of better health. (Or not. That experiment ended, but the Medicaid expansion\u2019s natural experiment will continue for longer and may provide more clarity.)\n\nFor those of us trying to evaluate the law, the slowness of results is frustrating. Still, Tuesday\u2019s study is quick by the standards of academic research. Big government surveys are asking some of the same questions posed by the Harvard researchers, but we\u2019re still waiting for their data from last year. Amy Finkelstein, an economist at M.I.T. and an author on the Oregon work, described the three-state survey as \u201centrepreneurial,\u201d because it gives us an early glimpse at these important questions.\n\nIt will take more time, and more research, to be sure whether the Affordable Care Act really is making Americans healthier and more secure.\n\nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Last summer, he partnered with a Chicago-based start-up called Alltuition.com and accompanied the larger site\u2019s team to an \u201caccelerator\u2019\u2019 event called 500Startups in Palo Alto, California\u2019s white-hot center of technological innovation.\n\n\u201cI loved it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt was an infectious place to be.\u2019\u2019\n\nAt the end of the summer, Hamed could have stayed in Chicago and worked on his project. He decided to return to school. \u201cI had more to learn here,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOne factor that kept him at Harvard was its expanded commitment to entrepreneurship. This year, for example, Hamed is serving as a student coordinator at the Innovation Lab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a different environment from when Zuckerberg was here,\u2019\u2019 Hamed said. \u201cHe was working with his roommates in his dorm room; I\u2019ve been able to work with an innovation lab. I\u2019ve talked to venture capitalists; I\u2019ve looked at term sheets. I have office space and people to work with.\n\n\u201cIf Zuckerberg were here today, I bet he would have stayed a little longer,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEven the founder of Facebook might agree. Speaking at Stanford University last month, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIf I were starting now, I would have just stayed in Boston.\u2019\u2019\n\nZuckerberg did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWong, 21, could also be a strong candidate for Facebook. A physics and computer science major, Wong started EventPlease.com after he found it frustrating to publicize events across the campus.\n\nOne problem, he discovered, was that Facebook does not offer a comprehensive guide to all campus events, just the ones that your Facebook friends are recommending. So Wong created a centralized portal where students can post events such as concerts and interest group meetings. Ultimately, the events can be saved to users\u2019 Facebook accounts, further widening their exposure.\n\nWong said he \u201cisn\u2019t quite happy\u2019\u2019 with EventPlease yet, but he\u2019s already been contacted by two colleges that would like to implement it. \u201cSometimes I think that the idea might have potential,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy and community\u2019\u2019 around these kinds of projects at Harvard, Wong said.\n\nStudents don\u2019t have to study computers to follow the Zuckerberg path. Senior Seth Riddley, 25, literally woke up in the middle of the night with the idea for a website that encouraged students to have lunch with a randomly chosen fellow student as a way of getting out of a social rut.\n\nRiddley, who studies the history of science, figured out how to put the site on the Web. Then a favorable mention in the Harvard Crimson sparked hundreds of lunch requests. Versions of the site are now running at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWorking on the project, Riddley said, \u201cthrust me inadvertently into the entrepreneurial community. Now I\u2019m really interested in it.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter graduation, Riddley is hoping to work with a nonprofit organization that serves people with mental illness, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not techie,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut now that I\u2019m learning how to start something and gain support for a project and pitch an idea, I\u2019m going to approach it with that start-up spirit.\u2019\u2019\n\nTwo students who won\u2019t be attending the Zuckerberg event are Axel Hansen and Jonah Varon, both 20, who are taking a year off to work on a project they developed during their freshman and sophomore years at Harvard: Newsle.com.\n\nNewsle is a social media site that allows users to track actual news events involving people you know, the kind of events that make it into newspapers, blogs, and newsletters, rather than wait for news to be posted by friends, as on Facebook.\n\n\u201cOne big change that came after Zuckerberg is that now it\u2019s OK to start your own company as an undergraduate,\u2019\u2019 Hansen said.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of encouragement,\u2019\u2019 Varon added.\n\nLast year, when they were sophomores, the partners won a $10,000 innovation grant from Harvard. After exams, they moved to San Francisco.\n\nThey\u2019re still there. As the summer came to a close, they decided to take the academic year off to work on their project.\n\nDavid L Ryan / Globe Staff Photo\n\nZachary Hamed shows his ticket for the Q&A with Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cAt some point we made the transition from a student project to a start-up,\u2019\u2019 Varon said in a phone interview. \u201cSince then, we haven\u2019t been thinking a whole lot about school.\u2019\u2019\n\nBoth said that if they were still at Harvard, they would have tried to attend the Zuckerberg event, but that he would not have had much of a chance to woo them.\n\nIn fact, they are looking to hire a programmer themselves - a big step for a potential next Facebook.\n\nBut it\u2019s tough to hire in San Francisco, where there is so much competition for tech talent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because they say hire from your network,\u2019\u2019 Hansen said. \u201cAnd most of the people in our network are still in school.\u2019\u2019",

It\u2019s sold-out, but still a million details for catering, security, parking, VIP seating. I set up my office for a few hours in my car on the gas line.\u201d\n\nBy 4:30 p.m. Califano, 60, said he knew which guys on line had prostate problems because they started scrambling for places to relieve themselves. \u201cThe Gulf station has a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and people sipped coffees.

So guys started looking for bushes, trees, big trucks to hide behind.\u201d\n\nBy 6:30, temperatures plunged and car heaters whirred. \u201cThat burns precious gas,\u201d said Califano. \u201cBut everybody figures the magic Gulf truck will soon be here.\u201d\n\nBy 8 p.m. still no gas truck. \u201cBut a Shell truck makes a delivery across the street where there\u2019s another line, which gives me hope,\u201d Califano said.\n\nPeople turned off their engines, got out of their cars and formed cliques. The Town Car livery drivers talked shop. The truckers compared notes. \u201cNeighborhood guys like me yakked about the old days in 1978 when Bensonhurst was all Italian and the owner of every station was a third cousin who filled your tank. Now gas stations are minisupermarkets with 800 area-code numbers they answer on another continent and nobody knows from nobody no more.\u201d\n\nThe gas line became an eight-block long small town that took on a life of its own. \u201cI\u2019m in six hours when I see a guy storm to the passenger window of the car two cars in front of me,\u201d Califano said. \u201cHe reaches in, smacking the woman passenger, trying to drag her out the window. I\u2019m ready to grab him, but he\u2019s screaming at the driver to mind his business, that she\u2019s his wife! The driver spins the wheel and burns rubber outta there with the wife half-hanging outta the window and her husband chasing after the car down Bath Ave. I gain one car length in six hours.\u201d\n\nJust after 9 p.m. the first profiteers arrive, selling empty gas cans. \u201cI ask, \u2018How much,\u2019 \u201d Califano said. \u201cGuy says, \u2018$35.\u2019 I ask if he Simonizes my car for that, too. But people bought \u2019em right up. Now other guys come selling gas in 5-gallon Poland Spring water-cooler bottles for $60 \u2014 $12 a gallon \u2014 off the back of a truck with cardboard Jersey plates. I woulda paid $60 a gallon if I knew it was real gas but I have no idea if it\u2019s gas, Log Cabin syrup or Vitalis in there. People bought it all.\u201d",

        "text": "Anyone who\u2019s ever shipped a package with FedEx has probably noticed the handheld wireless gadgets that its employees use to register and track packages for transit.\n\nFor about 15 years, FedEx couriers have used a device known internally as the \u201cSupertracker,\u201d which looks a bit like a handheld bar code scanner on steroids. Along the way, FedEx built its own wireless network for tracking packages, one that has grown almost in parallel with U.S. wireless phone networks.\n\nFedEx Today, FedEx is expected to announce that its package-tracking data will start riding the same wireless phone networks that consumers use and that its employees will have a new way to collect and track that data. The company will announce that it has teamed up with wireless concern Motorola to design a new generation of handheld devices that will give FedEx couriers and other employees a more complete picture of the tracking process.\n\nFedEx will put some 40,000 of the new devices, dubbed FedEx PowerPad, in use. The devices will connect to wireless phone networks run by the AT&T Wireless unit of AT&T . They\u2019ll use the data-heavy general packet radio system (GPRS), which lets wireless consumers send e-mail and surf the Web from their mobile phones. The PowerPad has been built tough enough to resist drops and moisture, and to keep running for 12 hours at a time. And when FedEx delivers a package, customers will sign their names directly on the handheld\u2019s screen.\n\nSwitching to publicly available wireless phone networks will save FedEx the cost of operating much of the wireless network that it has for more than a decade. The company plans to take down radio towers where its old network is redundant with the GPRS network. And in places where GPRS isn\u2019t reliably available, the old towers will be relocated there, filling out the gaps.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice win for Motorola, which will be selling FedEx the devices over the next two years. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The unit, which runs on Microsoft \u2018s Pocket PC operating system\u2013the same one that runs on devices like Hewlett-Packard \u2018s iPaq and others\u2013will also be available to other corporate customers.\n\nFor FedEx, the increase in efficiency won\u2019t be apparent until next year, but its shipping business is growing. The company said today that its FedEx Ground unit will handle an average daily volume of 2.6 million packages during the week of Nov. 25, which will be its busiest week ever. That\u2019s about 20% higher than the average daily volume it reported in its most recent quarter, ended Aug. 31.

        "text": "IT'S OFFICIAL: CAPITAL LETTERS CAN BE DANGEROUS.\n\nAt least, that's what the US federal highway administration believes. According to the New York Post:\n\nIn New York City, this will mean replacing 250,900 street signs with signs that cap up only the initial letter. So BROADWAY will become Broadway. A new font, Clearview, has been developed for the purpose. Cost: $27.6m (although, to put that figure in perspective, 8,000 signs have to be replaced every year for $110 each through normal wear and tear).\n\nOfficials argue that the changes will save lives and the city's transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, also suggested that the new signs might reflect a kinder, gentler New York. \"On the internet, writing in all caps means you are shouting,\" she said. \"Our new signs can quiet down, as well.\"\n\nDespite hysterical Daily News coverage that said \"several\" New Yorkers were \"outraged\" by the change \u2013 it quoted three \u2013 the paper's own poll showed that two-thirds of the public is behind the switch from capital letters.\n\nIt won't surprise regular Guardian readers that I agree with them. The Guardian style guide has long encouraged the gradual move away from capitals. So do other newspapers and websites, although some venerable style guides are still agonising over whether to lowercase internet and world wide web. (Be assured they will do so, perhaps in time for the 22nd century.)\n\nIn part, the switch from capitals reflects a society that is less deferential than in the days when the Manchester Guardian would write something like this: \"The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, Mr LLOYD GEORGE, presented the Naval Estimates to Ministers and Members of the House.\"\n\nMost readers seem comfortable with a less formal style. A grand total of two people complained about our coverage of the pope's, rather than the Pope's, recent visit to the UK. We did receive a letter last week complaining that calling David Cameron the prime minister, not the Prime Minister (a style we have been following for more than a decade) reflected a \"lowering of standards\", but such complaints are few.\n\nWe need to be ever-vigilant, however, against the capital offenders. Politicians, civil servants and Estate Agents are three groups that remain intent on drowning us all in this alphabet soup. (Yesterday I was presented with a government statement that said: \"On the Chancellor's recommendation the Prime Minister has appointed the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to the Public Expenditure Committee ... \")\n\nCapitals do have their uses, of course. As the Urban Dictionary puts it: \"Capitalisation is the difference between 'I had to help my uncle Jack off a horse' and 'I had to help my uncle jack off a horse.'\"\n\nTo return to traffic signs. New York's commendable decision is an echo of one taken in the UK 50 years ago, when the brilliant designers Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert, given the task of updating the country's chaotic system of road signs, concluded that \"a combination of upper and lowercase letters would be more legible than conventional uppercase lettering\". They produced a new font, known as Transport, which they felt would be friendlier and more appealing to British drivers than the stark modernist style used in continental Europe. The classic British road signage that they designed is still in use.",

As a result, Casale said agents are increasingly focused on showing the tipper received a monetary or other tangible benefit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a slowdown in our process of thinking about cases,\u201d Casale said in an interview last week. \u201cThis was a hurdle we had to overcome.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the FBI and prosecutors will be able to ultimately bring charges in those 30 undisclosed investigations. Such probes can often be closed without charges being brought.\n\nThe FBI would not comment on the details of the undisclosed probes and did not provide information on how advanced they were. Casale said some involved multiple individuals.\n\nThe law of insider trading meanwhile remains in flux. The U.S. Supreme Court in January agreed to review an appellate ruling out of California, and could use that case to clarify the definition of insider trading.\n\nThe FBI has been pursuing insider trading cases with, among others, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has since 2009 announced charges against 107 people, and secured convictions of 81 individuals.\n\nThose charged this year include famed Las Vegas sports gambler William \u201cBilly\u201d Walters, who has pleaded not guilty, and hedge fund manager Sanjay Valvani, who worked at Visium Asset Management LP and committed suicide last month following his indictment.\n\nCasale said he was optimistic that the FBI\u2019s undisclosed probes would result in more individuals being charged, despite the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. Still, he acknowledged that the decision posed additional hurdles.\n\n\u201cIt may take more stones to overturn than it would have in the past,\u201d he said.",

The cost - from about \u00a3150 to over \u00a32,000 - is determined by location and exotic extras. Options such as mariachi bands, helicopter rides and Balinese dancers send the price rocketing.\n\nAs a rule, the package includes sorting out the legal administration, organising the bouquet, buttonholes, cake and a Champagne reception. Photography or video recording usually costs extra. Most wedding packages are overseen by a co-ordinator, and can usually be customised, on request.\n\nBe wary of \"free weddings\" tacked on to the cost of a honeymoon package. These can sometimes translate into a swift exchange of vows witnessed by gawking hotel guests - with dodgy photographs, cheap cake and sweet fizzy wine.\n\nBefore choosing a hotel, check the number of weddings it carries out. Some resorts stage so many that newlyweds can find themselves sharing their special day with rather more people than they had intended. Couples who decide not to bring any relatives may enjoy the cameraderie. But those who want to avoid the risk of a ceremony conducted as the next party is lined up on the lawn would be well advised to select a hotel where weddings are not the main trade.\n\nWeddings abroad can be insured, although this is intended to supplement rather than replace travel insurance. Similarly, a ceremony overseas and a reception at home can be covered under one policy.\n\nBesides contacting tour operators and tourist boards, you can obtain general advice on the internet. Useful sites include www.confetti.co.uk's travel section and and www.weddingsabroad.com.\n\nIn Las Vegas just about anything goes. Pick up your licence from the county clerk's office at the courthouse and then, for the most bizarre ceremonies, look up Charlotte Richards, \"the wedding queen\", an ordained minister who owns the most famous chapels in town. She has officiated at weddings on horseback, while a bride-to-be was in labour, and even on a mountain, where the lovers were supported by ropes.\n\nMore mundane Vegas choices include drive-in chapels, where the ceremony takes three minutes and you don't even have to turn the engine off, and themed ceremonies such as the \"Elvis Experience\", complete with a Presley-lookalike serenading the nuptials and a ride in a pink Cadillac.\n\nBritish Airways Holidays (0870 608 2244) has Las Vegas wedding packages from \u00a3149 per couple. Flights, transfers and accommodation extra.\n\nIn Florida, keen divers can mouth, \"I do,\" surrounded by branches of coral and in the company of grouper and angel fish. White taffeta and lace wetsuits might be hard to track down, but a tick on a slate will confirm you as man and wife. Non-divers are taught enough basics to last them for the 20 minutes underwater, while qualified divers need only bring their dive certificates.\n\nThe cost of the wedding starts at $100 (about \u00a369) payable locally, and the basic diving course costs from \u00a3134. Contact Virgin Holidays (01293 744265).\n\nFollow in the footsteps of Taylor and Burton and marry in Botswana. Their second wedding took place within the Moorish-style Chobe Game Lodge, in the national park in the north-east of the country. The lodge is famed for its incomparable viewing of elephants, buffalo and antelope. Couples marry on the terrace or while cruising on the Chobe River. The tour operator promises all brides and grooms a \"complimentary mini-bar with unlimited supply of drinks\".\n\nArgo Holidays (020 7331 7095) has three- night all-inclusive wedding packages to Chobe from \u00a32,059 per person.\n\nOnly a few years ago, the red tape surrounding marrying in Italy, made the Maastricht Treaty sound simple. But now you can leave the to-ing and fro-ing between consulates to a handful of specialists.\n\nThe choice of venues can be wonderfully romantic - from a Venetian gondola to a sailing boat off Capri, or a Tuscan castle.\n\nThe Castello Vincigliata near Fiesole, a medieval tower discovered and restored by Lord John Temple Leader in 1840, overlooks Florence. You can exchange vows with an English-speaking Catholic or Anglican priest officiating, enjoy a wedding picnic in an olive grove, or even - if you give enough notice and money - stage a six-course Italian feast with performance by Luciano Pavarotti himself.\n\nWeddings Made in Italy (020 7520 0470) can arrange a wedding package here from \u00a31,989 including a priest and a picnic.\n\nNew to the nuptial scene is Lapland. For skiing couples fancying a touch of synchronised wipe-out, Inghams (020 8780 4433) features weddings on the slopes, followed by a blessing in the parish church of Levi. At \u00a350, the ceremony is something of a bargain - but alcohol in Lapland is far from cheap and unfortunately you can't take your own. Interesting extras include stag or hen sauna-parties, a horse-drawn sleigh ride to church, and - something of a passion-killer perhaps - a honeymoon igloo.\n\nA week in Levi costs from \u00a3398 per person including half board in a three-star hotel, return flights and transfers.",

Association.\n\nOver two years, money from the challenge has helped fund the research and development of treatment drugs and has been used as prize money to entice people to design technology for people living with the disease, which causes a rapid breakdown in a person\u2019s ability to control muscle movement.\n\nThe association released a chart last year showing where the funds went:\n\n\u2022 $77 million, or 67 percent, went to research.\n\n\u2022 $23 million, or 20 percent, went to patient and community services.\n\n\u2022 $10 million, or 9 percent, went to public and professional education.\n\n\u2022 $3 million, or 2 percent, went to fund-raising.\n\n\u2022 And $2 million, roughly another 2 percent, went to payment processing fees.\n\nThe latest development, announced by the association this week, falls into the research category: It\u2019s the discovery of NEK1, which scientists say is among the most common genes that contribute to the disease and is associated with 3 percent of A.L.S. cases. The discovery, published in Nature Genetics, is the result of a global gene-sequencing effort involving 11 countries and 80 researchers, called Project MinE.\n\nThe challenge money allowed the association to invest $1 million in Project MinE, and \u201cinitiated the U.S. arm of this international effort,\u201d Carrie Munk, a spokeswoman for the association, said.\n\nThe discovery of NEK1 is significant but is not a breakthrough \u2014 some 30 genes tied to the disease have already been identified \u2014 according to Brian Frederick, executive vice president for communications and development for the A.L.S. Association.\n\nMr. Frederick said that the discovery of the gene could eventually mean that \u201ctreatments won\u2019t be limited to one subset of people with A.L.S., but that it might be a more broad group.\u201d\n\nThe movement took the internet by storm in July 2014, and many supporters trace the tipping point to a video posted by Pete Frates, a former college baseball player who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012. Others followed suit, including celebrities from Mark Zuckerberg to Lena Dunham, who consented to having a bucket of water dumped over their heads for a good cause.\n\nThe challenge spread as wildly as it did because the premise involved people reaching out to each other on social media with a simple request: Film yourself getting water dumped over your head or donate money to A.L.S. research. Many did both, but critics disparaged the movement as \u201cslacktivism\u201d or an outright racket. A.L.S. awareness activists, however, say that the challenge reinvigorated a research community that was lacking attention and funds to produce scientific advancements.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an excitement and an energy in the A.L.S. research community that has not been there before,\u201d Mr. Frederick said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of hope and optimism among many people living with A.L.S. now.\u201d",

Really, the only thing every meal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I had about five a day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had in common was their prices. That polenta entree, by far the most elegantly presented of my month on the road, was just $13.\n\nThe sandwich, meanwhile, was $3.60. Iowans may already know where it came from: Canteen Lunch in Ottumwa, a modest meatpacking city of 25,000. Since 1936, the restaurant has sat in a squat, yellow box of a building; it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t budge when a municipal parking garage was literally built over it. (If you follow a GPS there, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find yourself in the garage; otherwise cut down an alley off South Court Street.)\n\nThe experience at the lunch counter feels very middle school cafeteria: a lunch lady look-alike takes your order and spoons loose ground beef \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sloppy joe without the slop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 onto a bun, slathers on extras, wraps it and hands it to you. (What, you wanted a plate?) It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a signature Iowa lunch, generically known as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca loose meat sandwich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here it was simply a Canteen.\n\nThe Canteen is proof that if an expert combines fat, carbs, sugar and salt in just the right ratio, the result can be worth the calories and ensuing sluggishness. I augmented the coming lethargy by ordering a strawberry malt ($3.95), after being encouraged to do so by the visitors next to me, a couple from Georgia who had come up to Iowa to look at a used RV. (In Ottumwa, that counts as out-of-state tourism.)\n\nFor that farm dinner, I headed 120 miles west (driving long distances burns calories, right?) to the 400-person town of Orient, or, more accurately, to the Henry A. Wallace Country Life Center (wallace.org) outside it. Never heard of it? Neither had I. Mr. Wallace, who was secretary of agriculture (and then vice president) under Franklin D. Roosevelt, was raised in the main house, now a gift shop; the center, in that reconstructed barn, is part of a nonprofit that promotes \u00e2\u0080\u009clocal food, sustainable agriculture and civility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The restaurant, also housed in the barn, is only open on Fridays and some Saturdays. Whatever does not come from the farm itself comes from a producer somewhere in Iowa, I was told by my server, who dutifully provided all the sustainable-locavore-other-buzzword details \u00e2\u0080\u0094 almost, but not quite, to the point of parody.\n\nEverything was as fresh as the canteen sandwich was processed: a $7 \u00e2\u0080\u009ccheese and relish plate\u00e2\u0080\u009d had bursting cherry tomatoes, crisp cauliflower lightly marinated in vinegar, pickled beets, and a crumbly local Cheddar, then came the polenta-stuffed zucchini. Outside, farmland stretched to the horizon, inside, my wallet barely stretched at all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I was out $25, including tip.\n\nDuring the rest of my sprint around the state I would continue to Ping-Pong between fatty gluttony and farm freshness.\n\nMore gluttony: the pork tenderloin sandwich, which has spawned best-in-state competitions and the cleverly named Des Loines blog. Newcomers will laugh at the little bun haplessly trying to cover the enormous tenderloin, pounded into the irregular shapes that often resemble Eastern European nations. For my representative pork tenderloin sandwich, I decided on Goldie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ice Cream Shoppe (goldiesicecreamshoppe.com), an ice cream stand turned diner in Prairie City, whose $5.98 version won best of show in 2009 from the Iowa Pork Producers.\n\nThe staff was gentle to a newcomer, explaining that the conventional toppings were pickle, raw onion, ketchup and mustard. Ketchup and mustard seemed heavy-handed, so I went for just pickles and onions to add a little pop. When the sandwich arrived, I struggled with its size \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I had been given only a knife, not a fork. I gave the server a perplexed look. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCut it in half,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. I felt, and not for the first time on this trip, like a bumbling foreigner.\n\nBack to lean and green: Fairfield, home to the Maharishi University of Management, which calls itself a \u00e2\u0080\u009chome of consciousness-based education,\u00e2\u0080\u009d has more than its share of vegetarian cafeterias and restaurants. I went to the Golden Dome Market and Cafe, near (but alas, not in) the campus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two golden domes. The vegetarian buffet ($7.50 a pound) yielded some saag paneer, a bean taco loaded with vegetables, some tasty artichoke lasagna and a piece of fresh peach blueberry pie.\n\nIowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farm-fresh side melds with its gluttonous side at the Des Moines Farmers Market (desmoinesfarmersmarket.com), which takes over a chunk of the capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downtown every Saturday morning, May through October. One minute I was dipping pretzel sticks into eight flavors of artisan goat cheese from Reichert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dairy Air or enjoying herb lemonade (infused with rosemary, thyme, lemon balm and ginger) from Blue Gate Farm. I followed this up with something called \u00e2\u0080\u009cBreakfast Ice Cream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d offered at a dairy stand for $5: a server put glazed doughnut holes in a bowl, covered them with bacon ice cream and added crumbled bacon and maple syrup. Big mistake. Unlike the Canteen, this unholy combo of sugar, salt and grease did not come to an agreement.\n\nI did find a truly harmonious greasy-locavore masterpiece, however, in Iowa City, just what you would expect from a college town in a farm state. Short\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Burger and Shine (shortsburgerandshine.com) gets its black Angus beef for its long list of burgers from a farm 26 miles outside of town; its buns are baked locally and its 10 taps filled with Iowa craft beers. (Another option: its own bean-based burgers.)\n\nAt the bar, I ordered a Gravity burger, with caramelized onions, bacon, tame green chili sauce and a swipe of jalape\u00c3\u00b1o flavored cream cheese and buried under a load of fries for $9.49. After sampling several brews, I ended up with a pint of Golden Nugget I.P.A., and wish I could have stayed for more, but solo traveling means you are the permanent designated driver.\n\nIndeed, I logged about 800 in-state miles in under four days. But Iowa turned out to be the most pleasant and picturesque of the states I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve driven through so far: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not dead flat, at least not for long stretches; its gently sloping farmland reads like some sort of fantasy Americana: deep-green soy fields, wavy rows of corn (which I tried not to think of ending up as high fructose corn syrup), picturesque red barns and the occasional old could-be-haunted farmhouses.\n\nI did miss the most famous house in Iowa: the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Gothic\u00e2\u0080\u009d house in Eldon, where the Pitchfork Pie Stand operates on summer weekends. I had planned a visit, but read on its Web site, TheWorldNeedsMorePie.com, that it would be closed the weekend I was in the state. It was probably for the best: the world may need more pie, but after three days of eating in Iowa, I sure didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.",

        "text": "The history of African-Americans has been shaped in part by two great journeys.\n\nThe first brought hundreds of thousands of Africans to the southern United States as slaves. The second, the Great Migration, began around 1910 and sent six million African-Americans from the South to New York, Chicago and other cities across the country.\n\nIn a study published on Friday, a team of geneticists sought evidence for this history in the DNA of living African-Americans. The findings, published in PLOS Genetics, provide a map of African-American genetic diversity, shedding light on both their history and their health.\n\nBuried in DNA, the researchers found the marks of slavery\u2019s cruelties, including further evidence that white slave owners routinely fathered children with women held as slaves.\n\nAnd there are signs of the migration that led their descendants away from such oppression: Genetically related African-Americans are distributed closely along the routes they took to leave the South, the scientists discovered.\n\nThe importance of that finding is not just historical, said Dr. Esteban G. Burchard, a physician and scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA detailed map of genetic variations in African-Americans will help show how genes influence their risk for various diseases. \u201cThis has tremendous medical relevance,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil recently, most research into the link between genes and disease has focused on people of European descent. \u201cWe\u2019re missing out on a lot of biology and diversity,\u201d said Simon Gravel, a geneticist at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nThe history of African-Americans poses special challenges for geneticists. During the slave trade, their ancestors were captured from genetically diverse populations across a portion of West Africa. Adding to the complexity is the fact that living African-Americans also may trace some of their ancestry to Europeans and Native Americans.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Gravel and his colleagues analyzed the DNA of 3,726 African-Americans who participated in three separate medical studies.\n\nThe scientists were able to pinpoint stretches of DNA in the subjects that originated on different continents. According to their calculations, the ancestors of the average African-American today were 82.1 percent African, 16.7 percent European and 1.2 percent Native American.\n\nDr. Gravel and his colleagues also estimated when those genes were introduced.\n\nWhen two parents from different ethnic backgrounds have a family, their children share long stretches of identical DNA. Over the generations, the stretches get smaller. The lengths serve as a kind of genealogical clock.\n\nMost of the Native American DNA identified by Dr. Gravel and his colleagues in African-Americans occurs now in tiny chunks. The scientists concluded that most of the mingling between Africans and Native Americans took place soon after the first slaves arrived in the American colonies in the early 1600s.\n\nThe European DNA in African-Americans, on the other hand, occurs in slightly longer chunks, indicating a more recent origin. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues estimate that its introduction dates to the decades before the Civil War.\n\nThe scientists gave some attention to the X chromosome in particular because of its role in sex determination. One X chromosome is inherited from mothers; fathers may contribute a Y or X.\n\nThe researchers observed that the X chromosome of African-Americans has a greater African ancestry than other chromosomes. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues believe this variation is explained by European men and African women producing children \u2014 in other words, slave owners raping the women they held captive.\n\nThe databases that Dr. Gravel and his colleagues studied also included information about where the subjects now live. The scientists used this information to help trace the movements of African-Americans through the United States.\n\nThey found very strong genetic connections between African-Americans in the Deep South and those in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nThe genetic similarities in African-Americans tend to cluster along the very train lines that their forebears took as they left the Jim Crow South: the Illinois Central to Chicago, for example, and the Atlantic Coast line up the East Coast.\n\nThe scientists were intrigued to find that European Americans who live in the South now are more closely related to African-Americans in the North or West than to present-day African-Americans in the South.\n\nDr. Gravel has proposed a surprising explanation: \u201cThe first people to migrate out of the South were the ones with the most European ancestry,\u201d he said.\n\nAlondra Nelson, the dean of social science at Columbia University and the author of \u201cThe Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation after the Genome\u201d said she did not think that result contributed much to understanding who left the South or why.\n\nIn the study, she noted, the researchers found just 1 percent more European ancestry in the African Americans who left the South.\n\nDr. Nelson noted that historians are increasingly collaborating on genetic studies like these. But the new study does not include a historian among its authors.\n\n\u201cThe human intentions around escaping racial terror can\u2019t possibly be reduced to genotype,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in understanding the Great Migration, it\u2019s a tremendous lost opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the new study said that the genetic variations of African-Americans across the United States could be important for medical research. Researchers who want to study the influence of genes on diseases in African-Americans must be aware of where their subjects live.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re drawing your cases from Chicago, can you use controls from South Carolina?\u201d asked Eimear E. Kenny, a geneticist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and a co-author of the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study would suggest you have to be very, very careful about that.\u201d\n\nDr. Burchard of U.C. San Francisco said that a better understanding of African-American genetics could also lead to discoveries that could benefit all people. Scientists found a rare genetic mutation in an African-American woman, for example, that lowered her cholesterol levels. That discovery led to a promising drug for heart disease.\n\n\u201cLo and behold, it was relevant to all populations, regardless of race,\u201d said Dr. Burchard. \u201cIt\u2019s relevant if you\u2019re European, if you\u2019re African, if you\u2019re Asian, if you\u2019re pink, white, blue or green.\u201d\n\nAn article on Saturday about a new study of African-American genetic diversity misstated the number of Africans brought to the United States as slaves. Though a precise figure is not known, scholars believe the number to be in the hundreds of thousands, not millions.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 28, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Study Reveals Genetic Routes of African-American Ancestry.

However, the party\u2019s leadership has previously been less keen, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appearing to rule it out.\n\nGardiner and Thornberry, the latter of whom has also taken the role of shadowing David Davis, the new Brexit minister, stress there are risks in proposing a new referendum or running a general election campaign based on overturning the EU decision or offering a vote on the terms of exit.\n\n\u201cSome colleagues are concerned that this would look like trying to have a second in-out referendum by the back door,\u201d they write.\n\nThe document, titled Responding to the EU Referendum Result, shows continued uncertainty within Labour over how to balance controls on the free movement of EU nationals into Britain against trade with the bloc. On Thursday, France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, told the British prime minister, Theresa May, that staying in the EU\u2019s single market could not happen if the UK imposed control over arrivals.\n\nThe briefing note agrees this balance will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, and that Labour had to accept voters\u2019 concerns over immigration. The document says the party must have a strong voice on the subject but does not yet set out what this will be. It tells MPs: \u201cIt will take time, and much greater consultation within the party, to develop proposals in this area, but that will be our priority for the coming months.\u201d\n\nOther areas are much clearer. The document says Labour deplores May\u2019s lack of guarantee for the status of EU nationals already in Britain, arguing this has \u201ccreated a climate where a small minority of individuals in our society feel it is acceptable to talk in terms of EU migrants living in Britain being told to go home\u201d.\n\nThe document also calls for the party to campaign hard over preserving rights originating from EU rules, such as those over employment.\n\nIt demands a delay in triggering article 50, which would formally set a two-year process for departure. This should not happen, the document argues, \u201cuntil there is a clear plan in place about what the UK will be negotiating for, and how that is going to be achieved, and until there has been some form of consultation on that negotiating plan, and formal approval of it by parliament and/or the public\u201d.\n\nOn a more openly party political note, a section of the document titled Key Lines to Take, urges Labour MPs to say the confusion is the fault of the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cIt was David Cameron who set a wholly artificial timetable for this referendum, believing that internal opposition inside the Tory party would be quelled as a result of his election victory last year,\u201d one reads. \u201cHe was wrong, and we ended up with media coverage of the referendum campaign entirely dominated by the bitter in-fighting within his cabinet.\u201d",

The procession dates from the 13th century and commemorates the return from the Second Crusade of the Count of Flanders, who is said to have brought with him some of the blood of Jesus. We knew that the relic would be paraded through the city in the afternoon, but other than that we had no idea what to expect.\n\nMore than 30,000 people turned up for the procession. We had neglected to reserve a seat in the stands in the main square or a caf\u00e9 chair on the pavement, so we peered out over the crowd while standing on a bench.\n\nWe quickly worked out that the procession involved scenes from the Bible, but without a programme we had to guess which ones they were. Some floats were easy to make sense of (a pharaoh in an elaborate headdress flanked by two pointy golden pillars; a statue of Jesus carried by dozens of Roman soldiers in tiny white shorts), while others were less so (a lounging couple in Arabian dress with a life-size stuffed peacock). There were sheep and donkeys, people waving palm fronds and purple-robed dancers bearing the Star of Bethlehem. It was confusing and colourful and I couldn\u2019t stop watching, even though my legs were cramping and my Bible knowledge is patchy at best.\n\nAfter the death and resurrection of Jesus, actors depicted the arrival of the relic into Bruges in 1150. Numerous knights on horses paraded through the city, followed by a man who discreetly picked up the droppings.\n\nThen the bell in the belfry tower began to toll ominously.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Blood must be coming,\u201d my friend said.\n\nPeople stood silently in reverence as clergymen carrying an elaborate gold reliquary walked by. Whether you believed in the authenticity of the relic or not, it was hard not to get swept up in the pageantry of it all.\n\nThe procession ended with a man on a castle-shaped float pulled by horses playing an intricate set of bells. Their delicate chime mixed with the heavy, rhythmic tone of the bell from the tower. A strangely beautiful song for a strangely beautiful parade.\n\nYour travel writing could earn you \u00a31,000.

Tough crowd at a casino, he explained: \u2018\u2018Like stabbing a minotaur to death with a kitchen knife.\u2019\u2019 But now he was in Washington, slipping into the buttery Naugahyde of a 1963 Corvette Stingray, and rough edges blurred, and women on Constitution Avenue were yelling \u2018\u2018Cool car!\u2019\u2019 at him instead of \u2018\u2018Mulva?!\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Ugh, what a car,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld said, stepping out of it near the Capitol Reflecting Pool earlier this month. \u2018\u2018What. A. Car. It\u2019s like having a hot dog on July Fourth with Scott Carpenter.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhich is why he selected it to drive to the White House and pick up the president of the United States, an upcoming guest on his ongoing Web series \u2018\u2018Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs the title would suggest, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is a bit of a detour for Seinfeld\u2019s show, which last season featured the likes of Jim Carrey, Steve Harvey and his long-ago sitcom partner Julia Louis-Dreyfus rolling around on vintage wheels and trading wisecracks with the star.\n\nBut this kind of showbiz cameo - Barack Obama\u2019s episode will debut online Dec. 30 - is business as usual for the president, who has collaborated with entertainers to tout his policies, burnish his public image or nudge a national conversation. In 2014, he appeared on Zach Galifianakis\u2019s talk-show parody \u2018\u2018Between Two Ferns\u2019\u2019 to talk up HealthCare.gov after its bungled rollout. This summer, he sat in Marc Maron\u2019s garage in Los Angeles for a wide-ranging podcast interview that touched on race and racism. Just last week, he appeared on NBC\u2019s \u2018\u2018Running Wild,\u2019\u2019 a nature-adventure show with British survivalist Bear Grylls, to voice his concerns over climate change.\n\nAfter Obama cited Seinfeld as one of his favorite comedians on Maron\u2019s podcast, Seinfeld jokingly suggested that his production team should reach out to the White House. The executive producer of \u2018\u2018Comedians in Cars\u2019\u2019 did just that.\n\n\u2018\u2018This was an opportunity to pull back the curtain for Americans on life in the White House,\u2019\u2019 the president\u2019s press office said in a statement. \u2018\u2018The president and Jerry had a unique, candid conversation that focused largely on the lighter side of the presidency.\u2019\u2019\n\nSeinfeld came to Washington a day ahead of his taping with Obama to capture scene-setting footage around town; unlike his usual guests, this one could not go freewheeling with him beyond the gates of the White House.\n\nAt the Capitol, tourists were beginning to notice Seinfeld, but only after they noticed the car, a shimmering mirage of silver-blue metallic in a small parking lot on the building\u2019s west front. Its back window, split down the middle, sloped into a dorsal haunch resembling its marine namesake. It was on loan from some rich guy in Connecticut who had already called the crew to ask about his baby, which hadn\u2019t been out of his sight in 32 years.\n\n\u2018\u2018The lines,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld gushed, as if describing the Ark of the Covenant. He pointed out the spatial intimacy between the body of the car and the wheels - tight but not too tight. Then he gestured to a nearby Chevy Suburban, a brute hunk of black metal, one of the production vehicles.\n\n\u2018\u2018See how much space is between the wheel and the body? That\u2019s why it\u2019s depressing. What\u2019s really missing from the world are cars you can just stare at,\u2019\u2019 he said, hands on the waist of his dad jeans, flaring back his navy blazer. \u2018\u2018We've decided it\u2019s more important to stay alive than look cool.\u2019\u2019\n\nJerry Seinfeld adores comedy and cars - he values the pursuit of precision and mechanical perfection - and a few years ago he combined them with his love of coffee and launched this series, which features short videos of wealthy funny people motoring around in classics that only they could afford. He picked up Ricky Gervais in an ice-blue 1967 Austin Healey 3000. He picked up Tina Fey in a candy-apple red 1967 Volvo 1800S.\n\nAnd in less than 24 hours he would pick up Barack Obama in the Stingray.\n\n\u2018\u2018You learn over the years how to handle yourself when you\u2019re taken out of your box and put into a situation that has different stakes and different jeopardy,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld said. But the anticipation of being with POTUS for 60 to 90 minutes was different. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t talk to anybody about tomorrow. I don\u2019t wanna talk about it. I kind of like to pace around backstage a couple minutes before I go on, so I've been doing that for about five days now.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe crew was also nervous, because the White House seemed nervous. The \u2018\u2018Comedians in Cars\u2019\u2019 shoot was arranged over the summer, but now the San Bernardino, California, shooting was still fresh; while Seinfeld taped B-roll, the president was preparing for a prime-time address to the nation.\n\nSeinfeld follows politics, but it has no place in his act. Political jokes rot on the vine. He likes his bits to be evergreen. Still, he considers the highlight of his career to be performing in the East Room in front of Obama and Paul McCartney in 2010, and he can\u2019t think of another U.S. president who would be as good on \u2018\u2018Comedians in Cars\u2019\u2019 as the 44th.\n\n\u2018\u2018He\u2019s done some really good work as a monologist at those correspondents dinners - that\u2019s how he qualifies to be on the show,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld said, referring to the annual black-tie gathering of White House reporters.\n\n\u2018\u2018Where\u2019s Kramer?\u2019\u2019 shouted a mustachioed tourist, eating popcorn at Fourth and Independence as the Stingray glided past. \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s Kramerrr?\u2019\u2019\n\nSeinfeld, who\u2019s always looking for a novel camera angle, suggested attaching a GoPro to the Stingray\u2019s windshield wiper.\n\n\u2018\u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s genius,\u2019\u2019 he said after, watching the playback in a parking lot by the Capitol Reflecting Pool, his voice reaching that Seinfeldian pitch of hysteria. \u2018\u2018Look at that shot! This is so funny. Look at that crazy angle!\u2019\u2019\n\nThe gathering tourists started chanting \u2018\u2018Jerr-y! Jerr-y!\u2019\u2019 as he opened the Stingray\u2019s door to drive to the Air and Space Museum. He gave them a wave, his cuff links glinting in the setting sun.\n\n\u2018\u2018I haven\u2019t been in here since I was a kid,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld said, hot-footing through the museum, sunglasses on, so he could use the restroom.\n\nThen back in the four-vehicle caravan, down around the Tidal Basin, past the World War II Memorial, onto Interstate 66 and the George Washington Parkway. The crew members hung out the open sliding door of a minivan to get car-to-car shots. Everyone was hooked up to walkie-talkies.\n\n\u2018\u2018Jerry, can you come around to our right?\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s meet them at Gravelly Point.\u2019\u2019\n\nSeinfeld drove the Stingray onto the grass as a jet screeched in for a landing at Reagan National Airport. The sun was nearly gone. A chill took its place. He emerged from the car and walked to his getaway vehicle, a ho-hum SUV of negligible make and model.\n\n\u2018\u2018A Festivus for the rest of us,\u2019\u2019 a biker in spandex called toward him, and Seinfeld twiddled a couple fingers in his direction, because you don\u2019t deserve greater acknowledgment if that\u2019s the best you can do.\n\nThe comedian was tired. The crew would get a twilight shot of the car at rest along the Potomac, but he headed back for room service at his hotel, where he would continue to pace and prepare. The conversation topics for the president would be quotidian. Seinfeld wanted to nab the normal in an abnormal life, the nothing in the everything.\n\n\u2018\u2018I wanna know how far he can get in his underwear before it\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld said from the passenger seat of the SUV. \u2018\u2018And can you really get a good night\u2019s sleep in this place? It\u2019s like \u2018Night at the Museum\u2019 to me, sleeping in the White House. I just had another question: Are you ever talking to somebody and do you ever think, \u2018This guy\u2019s out of his mind'?\u2019\u2019\n\nEverything went as scheduled the following day. Obama drove the Stingray on the White House grounds. The pair chatted in a basement dining room and Seinfeld asked about presidential bathroom routines, and the difference between presidential garbage and non-presidential garbage.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was out-of-body for me,\u2019\u2019 Seinfeld said by phone afterward. \u2018\u2018I'm not a guy who likes honor. In fact, I hate any kind of honoring. That I get to be a comedian, that\u2019s the honor. But this was an honor: that (Obama) was OK with me, that he trusted me to do some comedy with him in the real White House.\u2019\u2019",

The Brooklyn-based band, comprising songwriter-vocalist Kelly Zutrau (a Boston native) and multi-instrumentalists Joe Valle and Marty Sulkow, is already acclaimed for mixing intimate lyrics with atmospheric production to craft laid-bare lost-love laments, a skill it has demonstrated across one self-titled EP and successive slate of heartache-heavy singles (\u201cWhen you hold me, I still feel lonely,\u201d Zutrau sighs on breakout track \u201cYou\u2019re the Best\u201d).\n\nNow, with Wet\u2019s full-length debut, \u201cDon\u2019t You,\u201d dropping Friday and the three-piece embarking on its first headlining tour across North America, Zutrau says one particularly exciting part of the months ahead will be showcasing an evolution in Wet\u2019s sound.\n\n\u201cThe album\u2019s more lush and much more complex than the EP,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not confined to romantic relationships \u2014 it has bigger ideas and explores other kinds of relationships, including as metaphor.\u201d\n\nIn addition to introducing new material, the trio is also excited to play at some favorite venues \u2014 and whet its collective appetite (sorry) at nearby restaurants for the all-important post-performance meal.\n\nAnticipating Wet\u2019s sold-out show at the Sinclair on Monday, we asked about five stages (and savory stop-overs) the trio is looking forward to.\n\nVenues: The Mohawk, Empire Auto\n\nOn Tamale House East: \u201cIn Texas, the Mexican food people usually rave about is Tex-Mex, but we found that the Tamale House is pretty authentic,\u201d Sulkow says.\n\nOn the Sinclair: \u201cOne of our favorite shows from the last tour was at the Sinclair,\u201d Valle reports. \u201cThe sound in the venue is incredible, the staff was super professional and helpful, and the crowd was probably the most enthusiastic crowd we\u2019ve ever played to, so we\u2019re really excited to come back on Monday.\u201d\n\nVenues: Baby\u2019s All Right, Music Hall of Williamsburg\n\nOn Baby\u2019s All Right and Music Hall of Williamsburg: \u201cWe played on the opening night at Baby\u2019s All Right in 2013,\u201d says Valle. \u201cIt\u2019s a great venue and has been instrumental in supporting new and emerging artists in New York City, like us, Empress Of, Porches, et cetera, so we love playing there. Music Hall of Williamsburg is another venue we\u2019ve played several times, and is one of our favorite venues around the country.

        "text": "Every culture has its own complicated set of rules about sex. The fact that rules are made to be broken only adds to the fun. That is probably all we can conclude from the case of the Pussy Boat.\n\nThe artist Megumi Igarashi, known as Rokudenashiko, has been found guilty of obscenity in Japan for publishing data from which it is possible to 3D print a replica of her vagina, to raise funds for a kayak inspired by her genitalia. To any westerner who has ever looked at Japanese art, it seems a startling verdict.\n\nRelated: Is Nobuyoshi Araki's photography art or porn?\n\nFor eyes trained by a Christian tradition freighted with anxieties about the sinfulness of sex, the happy eroticism of Japan\u2019s shunga art is a delight. Many of the greatest Japanese artists lavished their skills on sensual imagery in woodblock prints made from the 17th to 19th centuries. My favourites include Hokusai\u2019s 1814 print The Dream of the Fisherman\u2019s Wife, in which a woman receives ecstatic pleasure from an octopus\u2019s tentacles and beak, and another by Suzuki Harunobu, done in the 1760s, of lovers seen through a window.\n\nThe erotic art of early modern Japan continues today in the photography of Nobuyoshi Araki, whose images of women tied up in varieties of ways are regarded by many as major works of contemporary art. That\u2019s without even considering the pop art world of manga, with its sometimes seriously disturbing images of sexual violence and abuse.\n\nJapan really does have an extremely libertarian attitude to the visual depiction of sex. It was only in 2014 that it outlawed the possession of child abuse images. Manga and anime were specifically excluded from the ban, prompting a debate around child protection and artistic freedom that rumbles on today. How can it be OK for comics to publish underage pornography but illegal to invite people to 3D scan your vagina?\n\nIgarashi is exposing the illogicality and irrationality of Japan\u2019s obscenity law \u2013 her vaginal kayak is a deliberate satire of a nonsensical set of rules. Yet no culture is rational about the sexual images and acts it licenses or forbids. Certainly, the west is in no position to look down on Japan, given its own strange and ever-changing attitudes.\n\nRelated: The top 10 female nudes in art\n\nEuropean and American ideas about art and sex are still haunted by Christianity. The nude remains a fraught and contentious arena \u2013 the painter George Shaw\u2019s conflation of \u201cartistic\u201d nudes with pornographic magazines in his new exhibition at the National Gallery wittily plays on those anxieties.\n\nGetting my Guardian at the newsagent\u2019s the other day, I was approached by an American couple who asked which paper had the \u201clascivious picture on page two\u201d. After a moment\u2019s hesitation \u2013 should I engage in a debate about sexism? \u2013 I told them it was the Sun, and it was page 3 they were looking for. They were disappointed. What they saw was \u201cmilder\u201d than they were expecting. Perhaps they hoped for something more like Araki.\n\nThat Japanese cultural mixture of extreme freedom and suppression, to which Igarashi has drawn attention, vindicates the French philosopher Michel Foucault. In his final work, The History of Sexuality, this controversial thinker argued that far from being the universal urge Freud identified, libido is shaped by \u201cdiscourses\u201d of sexuality that not only regulate but also shape and promote desire. Sex is not natural but cultural, a realm as strange as an octopus\u2019s garden.",

It's a title you may have never dreamed you could ever give yourself. But what if you could? I want you to\n\n. It's a lot of fun. Imagine all the good you could accomplish in the world.

It could be simpler than you think.\n\nBefore I show you a some surprisingly simple ways to become a millionaire, reflect on just how wealthy you are already. On\n\n, enter your annual net income or net worth and compare your wealth with the rest of the world. Say you net $20,000 in income every year. You're in the top 3.65 percent richest people in the world by income. Imagine if you make more.\n\nDon't whine because you're not a millionaire yet. It's OK to dream, but remember that contentment should be a cornerstone of your financial plan.\n\nSimple tasks are not always easy tasks. If I were to hand you a spoon and ask that you dig a hole 9 feet down into packed soil, that'd be straightforward and simple -- but not be easy.\n\nLikewise, you'll find some of these simple ways to be just that -- simple but not easy. But come on, you're tenacious enough for the job, right?\n\nJaime Tardy, author of \"\n\n,\" has interviewed hundreds of millionaires. \"One of the main traits of a millionaire is perseverance,\" she said. \"The ability to keep going in the face of adversity even when the finish line is very far away.\"\n\nAlthough these tips may seem surprisingly simple and familiar, don't underestimate their effectiveness.\n\nIdentify your competition. How hard are they working? What are some differentiators you can bring to your workplace or market?\n\nStart by working smarter. There's no use in working harder if your work isn't effective at producing income -- you'll be spinning your wheels.\n\nSimple, common sense changes can greatly improve your effectiveness: Don't sell ice cream cones on your front lawn in the dead of winter. Instead, set up a booth at the park in the sizzling summertime.\n\nWork harder than others are willing.

Are you willing to admit when you make mistakes?\n\nSome people, when faced with their own inadequacies, beat themselves up. And you know what that does? It paralyzes them from making the decisions they need to make to achieve success.\n\nSo, take the simple step to fess up and move on.

Chances are, if you create something that you'd use and love, others will too.\n\nMillionaires understand that some of the best ideas don't come out of costly research but out of a passion for making the world a better place.\n\nIn 1945, Percy Spencer experimented with a new vacuum tube while doing research for the Raytheon (\n\n). He popped popcorn, melted a candy bar and saw the great potential for what culminated into the microwave.\n\nTim Cook, the CEO of Apple (\n\n) recently explained in an interview with Charlie Rose that it's more difficult to edit than it is to create something new.

Boom. You're done. I like that.\n\nThere are other ways to start investing. I proved that in my\n\nwhere I opened up seven accounts with seven online brokers, funding each with $1,000. I wanted to show people how easy it is to get started investing.\n\nJust start somewhere. It's OK if you don't have a lot of money to invest right away.\n\n, with a little help from my mom. Start investing a few bucks and I'll applaud you. Also, once you start investing, don't abandon the ship. The stock market has its ups and downs. Just ride the wave. Think long-term.\n\nAs soon as you accept that you're not going to become a millionaire, you probably won't -- and you'll settle for the ordinary. After all, your beliefs affect your actions -- and your actions affect your outcomes.\n\nWhen you listen to discouraging people, you're letting them accomplish their goal -- to drag you down and ensure you don't surpass their success. No good.\n\nInstead, I suggest you prove them wrong -- but be humble about it. Your results will speak louder than your words, I promise you.\n\n\"I just love it when people say I can't do it. There's nothing that makes me feel better, because all my life, people have said that I wasn't going to make it. -Ted Turner, founder of CNN\n\nIf you've lived on this planet for any considerable number of years, you know that bad stuff happens. Sometimes several bad things happen all at the same time. That's why I recommend that you save some of your income for a rainy day.\n\nMedical emergencies can last years. Trees go through roofs. Jobs can be lost.\n\nHere's what this has to do with becoming a millionaire. If you have an emergency and don't have some liquid cash\n\n, you're likely to either go into debt (bad idea) or borrow from family members (very bad idea).\n\nThink of debt as the polar opposite of investing. Instead of you investing in companies, companies are investing in you -- looking to make as much profit as possible by pulling it out of your wallet. It's bad news, people.\n\nAccording to many experts, you should have around three to six months of expenses in your emergency fund -- in bad times, I recommend you shoot for eight months.\n\nThink trying to become a millionaire will change you? Don't. It's all about the journey. Just don't make the journey more complicated that it needs to be. These methods are surprisingly simple and easy to understand. Doing them is another matter. But I believe in you.\n\nRemember, it's OK to pursue millionaire status. But don't do it for the fame. Pursue it for your family. Pursue it for your community. Pursue it for a purpose greater than yourself.\n\nAfter you earn your million,\n\n\"Being a millionaire wont change who you are. It won't magically make your life better. You're still the same person. It's the journey of getting there that's the sweet part. Don't miss the good and bad of that journey. Understand what you want out of life and how much money you need to do that. Then be patient and persistent on doing whatever it takes to get there.\" -Noah Kagan, Facebook employee No. 30 and founder of AppSumo\n\n7 Surprisingly Simple Ways to Become a Millionaire\n\nIs your water bill due quarterly? Figure out how much you need to save each month to have enough to pay for the bill when it comes, and put that amount aside each month so you'll be prepared. Do the same for any bills due regularly but not monthly.\n\nBills you only have to pay once a year can be even harder to remember, so be sure to note things like property taxes, auto registration fees and insurance premiums and budget for them as well.\n\nAnnual subscriptions and memberships regularly trip up people's budgets. Be sure to set aside money each month for things like:\n\nOther expenses don't happen on a regular basis, but you can still predict the need to pay for them over the course of the year. Chief among these are repair and maintenance expenses, with the biggest ones being\n\n(oil changes, inspections, new brakes or tires, etc.) and home costs (leaky faucets, spring-time yard work, etc.).\n\nSome home repairs go beyond the scope of \"routine\" and require a significant amount of money in reserve. These can include replacing your roof, installing new windows or doing a major home renovation. You can anticipate the need for most of these repairs before you have to make them, so be sure to start budgeting for them in advance.\n\nYou also need to repair and maintain your body, so factor in medical costs like annual physicals, eye exams and dental checkups, as well as co-pays and prescriptions costs if you have any ongoing conditions.\n\nIf you plan to purchase any large items in the foreseeable future, from appliances to a new car, make sure you're putting aside enough each month to pay for them in cash. It's always best to pay for big-ticket items upfront rather than finance them (unless you can get a fantastic discount by financing and can pay the balance in full before any interest kicks in).\n\nFrom birthdays to holidays, there are plenty of special occasions each year to budget for. Make sure to include:\n\nYour four-legged family members also need to be part of your budget.\n\nDo you take an annual vacation? Travel twice a year to visit family for the holidays? Set aside money each month for any travel-related costs such as airfare, hotels, meals, rental cars and souvenirs.\n\nWhether you run a business or simply a household, there are certain expenses you may need to plan for in the business category. These can include:\n\nWhether you give annually to a charity of your choice or like to have some money set aside for your friends' and family's fundraisers, make sure to allocate enough each month to cover these donations\n\nA good budget allows for a little \"free\" spending money you can do with as you please. It can be $20 a month for fancy coffee at your favorite coffee shop or $100 a month to feed your favorite hobby. The amount doesn't matter so much as the fact that you're allowing yourself a little guilt-free fun to keep your budget from feeling too restrictive.\n\nDepending on your lifestyle, your eating out and entertainment budget could be a little or a lot. Whether you prefer to have dinner out once a weekend or see a movie every few weeks, figure out how much you'd ideally like to have and then examine any budget categories you can tweak to make room for it. If you realize you need to cut back on your habits a little to save money, that's fine too-at least you're aware of it now so you can act accordingly.\n\nEven if you're not a clothes horse, chances are there are certain items you'll need to purchase throughout the year. These can include:\n\nCalculate your annual spending on all clothing and accessories and divide that amount by 12 to determine how much you should be putting aside each month.",

        "text": "It\u2019s hard to be popular when you embarrass people and suggest your rivals sleep with swine. But Nick Denton, owner of Gawker Media, is trying to be liked all the same. After years of embracing the role of caustic outlaw, Denton is on a charm tour with his peers in the press\u2014last month, he smoked a joint in front of a New York Times reporter\u2014with the hope of showing everyone how he really, truly can play nice with others.\n\nA lot is riding on the outcome. The media industry is in a \u201cget big or go home\u201d phase, and Gawker is hoping to find a friend with deep pockets who has the backbone to stand behind his distinct, abrasive vision of journalism. In a recent chat with Fortune, Denton dropped hints about possible partners, shared his thoughts about Facebook and online advertising, and dispelled the idea that his newfound sunny disposition is the product of his recent marriage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the public interest to see Hulk Hogan\u2019s weiner per se,\u201d Denton tells me on a hot Friday afternoon in Gawker\u2019s soon-to-be-vacated office in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood. \u201cBut it is in the public interest to understand news stories. Like it or not, news and public life involves sex and drugs and other matters that people might find indecent. The only thing we find indecent is media that ignores stories people care about.\u201d\n\nThe Hulk Hogan example is not hypothetical. It instead reflects Gawker\u2019s position in a Florida court case where the former wrestler is asking a jury to award $100 million because the website published a short clip of tape showing Hogan having sex with the then-wife of a minor celebrity. The trial was supposed to start next week, but an appeals court ordered a temporary halt over a procedural issue; meanwhile, a court ordered the FBI to disclose evidence\u2013in the form of additional Hogan sex tapes\u2013to Gawker\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe trial, now set for October, still poses an existential threat to Gawker. But Denton sees the recent FBI ruling as a partial victory. He believes it validates his overall argument in the Hogan affair: That Gawker had a free-speech right to publish the tape not as titillation but as proof of the behavior of a self-aggrandizing celebrity who had already made his sex life public in a media narrative.\n\nAs for the Hogan story itself, it\u2019s classic Gawker-style journalism and one of the many bombshells published by the company\u2019s namesake publications and its sister titles, which include Deadspin (sports), Jezebel (women\u2019s interest), and Gizmodo (tech). Other stories published by the company have exposed the crack-smoking mayor of Toronto, the fictitious dead girlfriend of a football star, and quarterback Brett Favre\u2019s below-the-belt selfies. If there\u2019s a common thread here beyond male genitalia and stupidity, it\u2019s Gawker\u2019s willingness to report on powerful people even when others who have the same information will not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that organizations like us and BuzzFeed can provide some cover for newspapers that are more cautious. It\u2019s sort of flattering and good for the eco-system as a whole,\u201d Denton says. \u201cWe take the view that we\u2019re not responsible for an original breach, but if information is out there and it\u2019s interesting, we\u2019ll absolutely run the stories.\u201d\n\nDenton spoke well of BuzzFeed several times over the course of the interview, perhaps implying that his viral rival could be a strategic partner one day. The well-funded site (it\u2019s raised nearly $100 million in venture capital since its founding in 2006) has some of the same digital brashness as Gawker, and recently lent legal support in the First Amendment fight over the Hogan tapes. BuzzFeed is also expanding quickly. It has acquired smaller companies and attracted interest from the likes of Disney, though it has not publicly expressed a desire to invest in Gawker or any other media company.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get through the Hogan trial first before we talk about that,\u201d Denton said about his rumored search for investors. \u201c[But] it\u2019s clear that a robust media company needs a strong financial footing in order to face down illegitimate lawsuits like we\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\n(After this story was published, Denton sent an email saying, \u201cI\u2019m an admirer of Buzzfeed\u2019s evolution from viral marketing agency to media conglomerate. But I don\u2019t envision us going into the journalism business together.\u201d)\n\nEven for an unstable industry, 2015 has been a choppy ride for digital media. Smaller outlets have been wiped out (like my former employer Gigaom) or swallowed up (like Re/code, which was acquired in May by Vox Media, or TechCrunch and Huffington Post publisher AOL, acquired last month by Verizon). Recent technology trends, such as the spread of ad-blockers and readers\u2019 ongoing embrace of smaller screens where advertising is more difficult to sell, pose new challenges to publishers\u2019 business models.\n\nDenton is unfazed. He\u2019s adamant, for example, that media companies should not grab the apparent lifeline offered by Facebook\u2019s \u201cInstant Articles,\u201d which promise to bring publishers\u2019 content to Facebook users faster by natively hosting it within Facebook. Early partners for the effort, such as the New York Times, are tempted by the prospect of a new revenue stream and the chance to reach Facebook\u2019s FB vast audience. The catch? Facebook decides which articles will be seen.\n\n\u201cSo many media organizations are just playing to Facebook,\u201d Denton said. \u201cThey\u2019re just catering to the preferences \u2026 expressed in some algorithm that nobody understands. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re leaving offerings for some unpredictable machine god that may or may not bless us.\u201d Denton called the\n\nDenton added that the arrangement is not a true distribution partnership, but instead has forces media companies into a position of \u201cabject surrender.\u201d\n\nBut does he have a better idea? Denton claims that Gawker is doing just fine without Facebook in part thanks to its \u201caffiliate links\u201d partnership with Amazon, whereby the retail giant offers a small payment if readers click a link to a product. He also says the traditional display ad business is doing fine, and that mobile readers offer an opportunity for growth\u2014especially if publishers can get a cut of a booming market for app downloads, which Denton says is getting claimed entirely by Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd for anyone wondering about the true state of Gawker, Denton abruptly released the company\u2019s private financial records earlier this month. It\u2019s hard to guess his motives for doing so; the nominal explanation was that the release would serve to head off a bad story, but that could be puffery. Whatever the reason, the figures showed that, yes, Gawker is indeed making money, to the tune of $6.5 million in operating income last year.\n\nDenton has found his softer side, but you sure wouldn\u2019t know it from his websites. A smattering of recent headlines reveals Gawker\u2019s distinct brew of social criticism, gratuitous snark, and puerile distractions is still in full force: \u201cUnidentified Dong Dangler Drapes Hundreds of Dildos Around Portland\u201d; \u201cNo, Planned Parenthood is not Selling Aborted Fetal Body Parts\u201d; \u201cInspiring: a Full 0.56% of Facebook\u2019s 2013 Hires were Black.\u201d\n\nBut according to Denton himself as well as people who know him, he really has mellowed out. He\u2019s at long last learned to delegate, take advice, and yes, be nice to people.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the Nick Denton I started working for in 2009,\u201d said Gawker\u2019s executive editor, Tommy Craggs. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different company, which is a reflection of changes in his personality and a restructuring of the management group. There\u2019s a willingness to listen to more voices.\u201d\n\nCraggs suggested his boss\u2019s transformation has a lot to do with his marriage in 2014 to actor Derrence Washington. It\u2019s a popular refrain.\n\nDenton rejects the idea. \u201cEveryone looks for a narrative and it\u2019s a convenient narrative to pin someone\u2019s personal transformation on an event that gets summed up in a sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in order to get the husband that I have I would have had to change before I met him rather than after.\u201d\n\nDenton may have evolved on a personal level, but his professional mission is unchanged: He still wants to lampoon the smug and self-important, and tear down the clubby arrangements that allow insider groups \u2013 including journalists \u2013 to hoard information for themselves. Now, he just has to find someone with a big checkbook to do it with him.\n\nThis story has been corrected to note the appeal court delay ruling was related to a procedural issue, not to the separate FBI-related court order.",

Instead of Iron Man or Captain America, we\u2019re treated to a motley crew that consists of an everyman, a green Zoe Saldana, a live-action Kratos, Ranger Rick\u2019s temperamental cousin and an overgrown weed. But don\u2019t let their appearances or the unfamiliar intimidate you. Guardians of the Galaxy is laugh-out-loud funny and totally worth checking out.\n\nTo help you get ready for Guardians of the Galaxy, here are a couple things you should know.\n\nAbducted from Earth by aliens when he was a child, Peter Quill (Star-Lord), played by Chris Pratt, is an interstellar adventurer who travels the stars in search of riches and, of course, women.\n\nThe adopted daughter of Thanos (more on him below), Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, is a deadly green-skinned assassin with a troubled past who seeks redemption for her past crimes.\n\nPlayed by professional wrestler Dave Bautista, Drax is an imposing force who is on a warpath to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter. The tattoos that cover his gargantuan body tell the story of his life.\n\nOn the other side of the size spectrum is Rocket, a genetically altered and cybernetically enhanced raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. Don\u2019t let his size fool you though\u2013he\u2019s a bounty hunter and a mechanical genius with a penchant for blowing things up.\n\nVin Diesel voices Groot, a walking, talking tree-like creature that has the ability to grow itself into various forms at will. He is Rocket\u2019s bounty hunter partner and cellulose strongman. Groot\u2019s vocabulary, however, in Hodor-like fashion, is limited to only three words: \u201cI am Groot.\u201d\n\nThe Nova Corps is the military/police force that protects the planet Xandar. It boasts a considerable amount of corpsmen within its ranks, ranging from the rank-and-file Corpsman Dey, played by John C. Reilly, to their leader Nova Prime, played by Glenn Close.\n\nThe blue-skinned alien Yondu, played by Michael Rooker, is the leader of a ragtag band of intergalactic bandits called Ravagers. He\u2019s a surrogate father to Quill and carries around a deadly arrow that he can control by whistling. In short, don\u2019t mess with the \u2018du.\n\nFirst seen in the Thor: The Dark World post-credit scene, The Collector, played by Benicio Del Toro, makes an appearance in Guardians. The Collector, as his nom de guerre implies, is literally an intergalactic hoarder. He maintains the largest collection of species and relics in the galaxy, but always has room for one more.\n\nRonan, played by Lee Pace, is a fanatical member of the Kree race. Despite a peace treaty between the Kree and the Xandarians, he continues to fight a one-man war against his people\u2019s ancient foe, vowing at nothing short of the complete annihilation of Xandar.\n\nIf you stuck around for the post-credit scene in The Avengers, you would have been treated to a glimpse of Thanos, the purple-skinned alien baddy that was behind Loki\u2019s mayhem in the movie. Thanos is a supervillain with enough power to destroy worlds and subjugate countless more. Voiced by Josh Brolin, Thanos makes an appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy in a not-so-subtle foreshadowing of what awaits the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy is out in theaters on August 1, 2014.",

        "text": "The city of Cleveland has had a colorful history. The Cuyahoga River, which runs through the city, famously caught fire in 1969 thanks to rampant pollution, and it wasn\u2019t the first time. In 1978 it became the first U.S. city to default on its debts since the Great Depression. Cleveland sports fans have had to endure more anguish than those in any other city. The city has been dubbed with a less than endearing nickname: the Mistake by the Lake.\n\nThis year Cleveland takes the top spot in our third annual ranking of America\u2019s Most Miserable Cities. Cleveland secured the position thanks to its high unemployment, high taxes, lousy weather, corruption by public officials and crummy sports teams (Cavaliers of the NBA excepted).\n\nSlide Show: America\u2019s 20 Most Miserable Cities\n\nMisery was on the rise around the country last year. Sure the stock market was up big, but so were unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcy filings. Meanwhile housing prices, the U.S. dollar and approval ratings for Congress continued their downward spiral.\n\nThe widely tracked Misery Index initiated by economist Arthur Okun, which combines unemployment and inflation rates started 2009 at 7.3 and rose to 12.7 by the end of the year thanks to soaring joblessness. That is the highest level since 1983.\n\nOur Misery Measure takes into account unemployment, as well as eight other issues that cause people anguish. The metrics include taxes (both sales and income), commute times, violent crime and how its pro sports teams have fared over the past two years. We also factored in two indexes put together by Portland, Ore., researcher Bert Sperling that gauge weather and Superfund pollution sites. Lastly we considered corruption based on convictions of public officials in each area as tracked by the Public Integrity Section of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nWe expanded the list of cities under consideration this year to include the 200 largest metropolitan statistical areas (in years past we\u2019ve examined 150), which led to a shuffling in the ranks. Any area with a population of more than 245,000 was eligible.\n\nCleveland nabbed the top spot as a result of poor ratings across the board. It was the only city that fell in the bottom half of the rankings in all nine categories. Many residents are heading for greener pastures. There has been a net migration out of the Cleveland metro area of 71,000 people over the past five years. Population for the city itself has been on a steady decline and is now less than half of it what it was 50 years ago.\n\nCleveland ranked near the bottom when looking at corruption. Northern Ohio has seen 309 public officials convicted of crimes over the past 10 years according to the Justice Department. A current FBI investigation of public officials in Cuyahoga County (where Cleveland is located) has ensnared more than two dozen government employees and businessmen on charges including bribery, fraud and tax evasion.\n\nOn the housing front Cleveland is dealing with thousands of abandoned homes. The city contributed to its foreclosure problem by providing down payments to many people that could not afford homes through the federally funded Afford-A-Home program. Cleveland led by Mayor Frank Jackson sued 21 large investment banks in 2008 who he felt were complicit in the subprime and foreclosure crisis that hit Cleveland hard. A federal judge dismissed the suit last year, but the city is appealing the ruling.\n\nA 19% decline in foreclosures last year is possibly a glimmer of hope that the housing situation is starting to improve, although Cleveland still ranks in the top third of all metros for foreclosure rates according to RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed property. Cleveland and Cuyahoga County were awarded $41 million last month from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This money will go towards demolition of homes, foreclosure prevention and the rehabilitation of homes.\n\nThere are certainly bright spots in Cleveland. Downtown has experienced a revival over the past 15 years helped in part by the construction of three new sports venues for the city\u2019s NFL, NBA and baseball teams. The Cleveland Clinic is one of the top medical centers in the U.S. and the largest employer in northeast Ohio.\n\nMayor Jackson\u2019s chief of staff Ken Silliman calls 2010 a very exciting year for Cleveland. He points to three projects in development for the city. The first is the Cleveland Medical Mart which is a convention center that targets the medical and health care industries. Next is a casino plan. In November Ohio voters approved casinos in four cities, and Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert is leading a group that hopes to have a Cleveland casino up and running in three years. Lastly is the Flats East Bank project, which ran into funding issues during the financial crisis. The waterfront development will include an office tower, hotel and space for retail and dining.\n\n\u201cClevelanders over the years have developed a tenacity to deal with these kinds of situations, and we are very aggressive in attempting to solve our problems rather than awaiting someone else\u2019s solutions,\u201d says Silliman.\n\nOther cities on the list include Memphis, which came in third thanks to the second-worst rate of violent crime in the U.S. and an alarming rate of convicted public officials. Detroit, ravaged by the ailing auto industry was fourth. Flint, Mich., was fifth. Also on the list? Chicago (No. 10) and New York City (No. 16). Torturous commute times and nosebleed-inducing taxes are the high prices locals pay for the cultural opportunities and corporate headquarters located there.\n\nOur most miserable city last year, Stockton, Calif., nabbed the second spot on this year\u2019s list. Unemployment and crime continue to be major issues. Stockton ranked seventh worst in both of these areas. Stockton residents have average commutes that are among the highest in the country and, like all Californians, they suffer from onerous sales and income taxes.\n\nStockton Mayor Ann Johnston says the city is working to fix its problems. It has seen a reduction in crime in recent months as it targets troubled areas with an increased police presence. On the economic front, the city recently expanded the Port of Stockton, which it hopes will attract new companies. Stockton is an agricultural community, but the Mayor says the city is working to diversify its economic base and echoes Silliman\u2019s comments about Cleveland. \u201cWe\u2019re an All-American city,\u201d says Mayor Johnston. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because we sit on our hands and do nothing. It\u2019s because we recognize our problems and work to solve them.\u201d\n\nSlide Show: America\u2019s 20 Most Miserable Cities\n\nComments are turned off for this post.",

When asked by the hosts of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d if he was cutting off their allowances, he deadpanned: \u201cNo more allowance.\u201d\n\nBoth Eric and Ivanka have been heavily involved in their father\u2019s campaign, as strategic advisers and also appearing at a slew of events on the campaign trail. Ivanka in particular has been regarded as the \u201cquiet power\u201d behind the campaign, though she hasn\u2019t been as actively involved in recent weeks due to the birth of her son in late March.\n\nIn a roughly 10-minute long interview with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Trump also lamented the primary process in Colorado, where he lost badly to Cruz. But he refused to blame the registration process in New York for the failure of Eric and Ivanka to be able to vote, simply conceding that the rules are the rules.\n\nHe likely won\u2019t need their votes.

        "text": "For a number of years, Zogby International has been asking people if they consider themselves a member of the Investor Class. Thirty-eight percent of a November 2008 online sample of more than 24,000 voters so identified themselves, a number that shows how big an impact the stock and bond markets have on average citizens.\n\nWe have a detailed profile of the people who perceive themselves as investors, telling us both who they are and what they believe. Since we don\u2019t set any criteria for the Investor Class, we are measuring a state of mind.\n\nAmong people who don\u2019t see themselves as belonging to the Investor Class, 58% do own a 401K. Technically, they are investors. They just don\u2019t see that as who they are, and probably don\u2019t factor those considerations into how they look at the world.\n\nBecause they represent millions of people, those 38% who identify as investors are a varied group. Many are what I call the Invisible Investor Next Door, people with limited portfolios whose goals include maintaining their lifestyle, having a secure retirement and saving for their children\u2019s educations.\n\nNo matter their wealth or goals, there are differences in the demographics and beliefs of folks who do and do not identify as investors. But there are also many similarities.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the data from our large November poll to compare the two groups, first for demographics. Those who identify with the Investor Class are more likely than noninvestors to:\n\n\u2013Be married (70% vs. 55%) \u2013Have a valid passport (65% vs. 42%) \u2013Be a current or former gun owner (49% vs. 38%) \u2013Own a home worth more than $250,000 (50% vs. 30%) \u2013Have a family income of more than $100,000 (41% vs. 16%) \u2013Be male (53% vs. 43%) \u2013Be white (79% vs. 70%) \u2013Have a college degree (56% vs. 38%) \u2013Say they are white-collar workers (64% vs. 41%)\n\nThose are all differences that would, I believe, be expected. However, the statistical differences we see are not so great as to establish a stereotypical investor.\n\nFor example, 59% of self-identified investors have household incomes below $100,000 and 44% don\u2019t have a college degree. Blue-collar workers make up 15% of the Investor Class, a number that becomes more impressive when you consider that the total percentage of blue collars in this online sample is only 21%.\n\nThere is no significant difference on matters such as religion, whether they live in urban, suburban or rural areas, union membership, or even how often they shop at Wal-Mart. As for race, African-Americans and Hispanics combined make up 15% of the Investor Class, which isn\u2019t so far off their representation in the nation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at belief differences. In our November poll, the Investor Class is more likely than noninvestors to:\n\n\u2013Say they are political conservatives (41% to 26%) \u2013Have voted for John McCain (57% to 39%) \u2013Believe they and their families can achieve the American dream (81% to 58%) \u2013Believe that affirmative action programs reward some at the expense of others (69% to 56%)\n\nHere is data from a Zogby Interactive poll conducted Jan. 22-26, 2009 (sample 3,672), and Jan. 30-Feb. 2 (sample 4,565), where we found the Investor Class is more likely than noninvestors to:\n\n\u2013Rate President Obama\u2019s job performance as only fair or poor (37% to 26%) \u2013Say the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction (55% to 40%) \u2013Rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good (53% to 30%) \u2013Feel very or fairly secure in their current job (72% to 61%) \u2013Blame government for the current recession (54% to 40%).\n\nThe main takes here are that the Investor Class is more politically conservative and optimistic. But there are again caveats. Like the entire sample in our November survey, a plurality of the Investor Class (42%) call themselves moderates, which is only three points less than noninvestors. Let\u2019s also remember that this is an exercise in self-identification, and there are plenty of liberals who closely monitor their 401K accounts, but might recoil at thinking of themselves as part of an Investor Class.\n\nAs for optimism, there are significant spreads for belief in the American Dream and for rating their personal financial situation. However, another question in our late January poll shows both the Investor Class and others as having tepid confidence that their children will have a better life than they have had. For the Investor Class, 54% are very or fairly confident, compared with 49% for everyone else.\n\nWe at Zogby International have had a fascination with this group for nearly a decade for several reasons.

Lewis did not know precisely what they wrote, noting that their posts have been deleted.\n\nBut he said their termination was part of the same investigation that led to Monday's firing of Capt.

Today\u2019s answer for: How do you build a strong team? is written by Kathy Bloomgarden, CEO of Ruder Finn.\n\nBusiness these days requires a team mentality, as the workplace increasingly depends on collaboration, common goals and embracing shared values. But in order to really drive success, we must move beyond \u2018group think\u2019 and focus on how we\u2019re going to establish a killer team that doesn\u2019t shy away from bumps in the road.\n\nHand over the leadership reigns The most unproductive meetings are those where there are too many strongly opinionated leaders, with no one individual willing to take charge, drown out the noise and set a path forward. Often the success of the team is about getting beyond the circular discussions (we\u2019ve all been a part of them!) and taking action. This requires handing over the reigns to someone hungry and not afraid to make quick, hard decisions and keep the team moving.\n\nSee also: 3 misconceptions about leading a successful team\n\nSet aggressive goals I\u2019ve learned that a key reason for employee turnover is boredom. If you put individuals in one position for too long, they will eventually feel \u2018stuck\u2019 and are more easily lured by new opportunities, especially the millennial generation. It\u2019s important to work with each person to set aggressive yet realistic goals for growth, and arm employees with a hungry team willing to achieve them. If employees are encouraged to be part of a team that sets tough targets they will fell stimulated, challenged, and part of something important.\n\nEmpower your teams to own it Once aggressive goals have been established teams need to own what they sign up for. This means driving projects that produce results, giving tough love when necessary and speaking up when there are issues.

        "text": "\"I'm not here to make friends.\"\n\nThere's a reason people on reality TV insist that they're not looking for friendship. That's because so many friendships\n\nIn any social situation, whether you're slaving away in your office cubicle or painstakingly sculpting clay ashtrays at summer camp, you inevitably bond with the people around you. When you're on a TV show, removed from your real-life friends and family, you can't help but define yourself by your relationships with your fellow cast members. You have to repeatedly remind yourself that these people aren't in your life forever, that they're just transient bit players in the heroic story of You.\n\nBeing forced to exclaim \"I'm not here to make friends\" is basically an acknowledgment that you\n\nThe first person to ever utter those words on television, as Spencer pointed out last night, is actually our tribemate, Kelly Wiglesworth. It's a phrase that has unique resonance in\n\n, a game based on building alliances. When you're freezing and starving together in the wilderness, you simply can't build voting blocks purely on cold-blooded strategic calculation. You vote with the people you trust. As I said last night in the episode (can I quote myself? Is that weird?): \"Strategy is based on emotion. You've got to build real bonds in order to build real alliances.\"\n\nto make friends to succeed on\n\nAbi-Maria Gomes would disagree. Abi is definitively\n\nAbi seems completely incapable of extending sympathy to anybody but herself. When Woo shares an emotional story about how his mother barely survived a heart transplant, inspiring his\n\njourney, Abi tries to trump his victimhood.\n\nOh your mother was sick? Well my grandmother\n\n. And I also lost an aunt. And by the way, I had an injured knee.\n\nAbi needs a monopoly on the tribe's attention. If everything's not all about Abi, how does she even know she exists?\n\nWhen nobody supports her campaign for Victim-in-Chief, Abi adopts the same tactic as every other floundering candidate \u2013 she goes negative. Abi accuses Woo of being emotionally manipulative. If that's not the pot calling the kettle manipulative, I don't know what is.\n\nYou have to give Tasha so much credit for the way she placates Abi. You can see the conscious effort it takes for Tasha to stop her eyes from rolling all the way back inside her skull.\n\nSpencer, on the other hand,\n\nhere to make friends. Whether he's boating or he's voting, all Spencer wants is to connect. Spencer in some ways is Abi's emotional opposite. Where Abi can't control her overflowing id, Spencer is self-consciously emotional. He's like\n\n, a robot who just wants to be a real boy.\n\nI can attest that Spencer was extremely emotionally open at camp. He often talked about his girlfriend, his family and his personal aspirations.\n\nBut how deep should your friendships be? It's a delicate balance. For myself, I was consciously avoiding becoming too intimate with my tribemates. Before the season began, I spoke often with Cochran about how he kept his game in\n\nfrom being too personal. Cochran trumped Dawn at the end when jury members felt personally betrayed by Dawn but only strategically outplayed by Cochran.\n\nCochran told me that he would confine his conversation to game talk. People never felt deeply bonded to him \u2013 and therefore, never deeply wounded by him. You can make friends without becoming soul mates.\n\nThere's probably no right answer to the \"right\" amount of emotive. So much of the game depends on the people you're with and the situations in which you find yourself. A winning philosophy one season could spell disaster on another.\n\nWhile Spencer was connecting, Monica was plotting.\n\nI think Monica came into\n\nwith the intention to play hard. Her major flaw on her first season was that she coasted the first half of the game, and only really strategically came awake in time to get voted out by Russell Hantz.\n\nseason is that, by fixating so exclusively on a player's single game-losing flaw, it can cause you to overcorrect.\n\ncan be as slow as it can be fast, and Monica was going 90 mph in a school zone. We were gifted by the\n\ngods with a solid tribe majority on Bayon. Why mess it up?\n\nBut Monica was transparently scheme-y. She told Kimmi that she wanted a girl's alliance, not realizing that Kimmi was close with Jeremy and me. Monica also came to me and suggested a \"big move\" \u2013 which could only in context mean voting out Jeremy \u2013 without realizing that he and I had a budding bromance.\n\nInitially I was hesitant to vote for Monica. My biggest fear was that I thought we were due for another tribe swap. I was terrified that I would end up on a tribe with Savage and Joe and be blamed for betraying Bayon. Savage would never believe that steadfast Jeremy or loyal Kimmi could have turned on one of our own.\n\nI was somewhat placated by the fact that Monica had always been at the bottom of the Bayon hierarchy. But I \"joked\" with Jeremy that if there were a swap, and we were separated, he had better yell over to Savage that I was a decent human being.\n\nFurthermore, Spencer was too good an ally to vote out, and even Wiglesworth seemed a part of our cohesive new Bayon unit. Monica could be a greater danger down the road.\n\nWhat would have happened if Timbira had voted out Erinn Lobdell before the merge, or if Galu took out Shambo? The entire tribe would have benefitted from eliminating the weakest link.\n\nDisloyal numbers don't just hurt you; they help your opponent. In that way, they're like own goals at immunity challenges. (Check out this\n\nwhere I discuss my epic challenge blunder.)\n\nThe Fishy this week goes to the Bayon 3:Jeremy, Kimmi, and (\n\n) me. One of the major setbacks that dominant tribes often face is they never have the chance to vote out their flippers.\n\nMy only reservation with the vote was that we didn't tell Wigles or Spencer what we were doing. Jeremy was adamant about keeping them in the dark; he wanted to keep them nervous and fearful. And keeping people in the dark is the safest way to ensure that nothing goes wrong.\n\nBut Tribal Council is the one place you have on\n\nto prove trust to each other. If we missed an opportunity to build trust with our new tribemates \u2013 how could we truly make new friends?\n\nairs Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on CBS.",

The ruling underscores, like never before, how American courts are growing concerned with due process when it comes to data, and are demanding Congress modernize out-of-date privacy laws.\n\nIn any case, the decision is also a coup for Microsoft, which went out on a legal limb in the case, and won support in court from its rivals across the cloud and tech industries.\n\nThe other piece of good news is that the European Commission formally blessed the Privacy Shield deal that will let companies move data back and forth between the U.S. and the European Union. The pact was far from a sure thing, and the passing of the deal averts a regulatory Armageddon in which American cloud companies like Facebook and Amazon could have been forced out of Europe because of their data-handling policies.\n\nTaken together, the events reflect a growing awareness that cloud computing is now central to our social and economic lives, and that government authorities see a need to create legal structures to help it thrive.\n\nJeff John Roberts is a writer at Fortune.

While Fortune could not immediately reach a spokesperson for Oprah Winfrey, CNNMoney reported that a representative for the star said the Avon rumor is \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nAvon\u2019s sales and profit have been hit for years by a combination of woes: an exodus of its Avon Ladies sales representatives as its direct selling model struggles to adapt to modern realities, a strong dollar hurting sales overseas, and intense competition in emerging markets like Brazil and Russia.\n\nShares have been on a roller coaster all year. Last spring, the Wall Street Journal reported the company was looking to sell its North American business, giving shares a bump. Last week they jumped after a Citigroup research note suggested the worst might be behind Avon. Its market cap is now $1.64 billion, compared to $24 billion at its all time peak in 2004.\n\nWinfrey recently took a 10% stake in Weight Watchers for $43 million, which sent shares up 90% when it was announced. And the former talk show host, famous in part for her weight struggles, became an official participant in the weight-loss program.\n\nThe logic is less obvious with makeup and beauty products, especially given Avon\u2019s dire straits. And it\u2019s hard to imagine Winfrey getting hands-on in a fast declining business that many consider to be beyond repair. Avon\u2019s North American sales are less than half their 2007 levels, and its sales reps\u2014without whom Avon can\u2019t sell\u2014are leaving in droves: Last quarter, their number fell 13%, continuing a years long decline.\n\nLittle relief is in sight: Wall Street analysts expect total Avon revenues to fall 5.3% to $6.78 billion. (In 2011, they hit an all-time high of $11.3 billion.) Avon is set to update Wall Street in January on its plan to finally revive the company after countless turnaround attempts.\n\nAvon shareholders are still smarting from its rejection in 2012 of a $10 billion offer from Coty COTY , and they\u2019re so hungry for news of a lifeline that shares jump on rumors, whether or not they\u2019re true: In June they soared when a Bulgarian man made a bogus takeover offer to profit on the stock\u2019s rise.",

Even if it\u2019s really bad, people in Vence appreciate it. They won\u2019t be snobby and will correct you in a nice way if you get it wrong.\n\nIf you\u2019re using Vence as a base to explore further afield, don\u2019t be seduced by St Tropez.

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Private companies like Uber and Snapchat are not legally required to share financial information such as their valuation or the number of shares held by investors. For investors, that lack of transparency is something of a hazard.\n\nNow Equidate, a market for trading shares of private companies, plans to lift the veil on some of that information. The company, based in San Francisco, said on Monday that it would make a host of data about private companies free and open to the public, drawing from corporate filings that include the prices that investors have paid to invest in the companies. Equidate also plans to release tools that shareholders can use to calculate the value of their private-company stock holdings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving away this data to help create a more robust market and to give stakeholders like employees, investors and other shareholders a better way to understand the value of their stock,\u201d said Sohail Prasad, a co-founder of Equidate.\n\nThe lack of transparency around private companies, along with a scarcity of shares, has kept the market for start-up stocks fairly small. About $750 million of private shares are actively listed for sale on the Equidate marketplace. By comparison, the total public stock market in the United States includes trillions of dollars of shares.\n\nTo buoy the market for private-company shares, a handful of start-ups have worked to increase transparency and liquidity. Apart from Equidate, the start-up eShares lets privately held companies electronically issue and manage their shares so that investors know who owns what piece of the company at any given time.\n\nWhile information about private companies does exist, it is typically fragmented or hard to find in corporate filings without paying thousands of dollars a year to data-service companies. With Equidate\u2019s new data service and tools, investors can easily see what the current share price of a private company like Lyft might be on the Equidate marketplace and compare it with the price that venture investors and other institutions paid in the past.\n\n\u201cFor the last few years, a lot of companies raised money without having to share much data,\u201d said Semil Shah, an investor with Haystack Fund, a venture capital firm. \u201cThings have swung in the other direction.\u201d\n\nMr. Shah said that nearly everything about the private markets is opaque, including what information is shared between companies and their potential venture investors, and even between the venture firms and the investors whose money they manage. While the lack of disclosure can help entrepreneurs by giving them time to build businesses without scrutiny and can help venture investors negotiate more favorable deals, it can also increase risks for investors who may not fully understand what they are buying, he said.\n\nRegulators are also taking a closer look at the marketplaces for trading private-company stock, which are generally known as secondary markets. Mary Jo White, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a March speech that in the past, private-company secondary markets were rife with issues including conflicts of interest and fraud.\n\n\u201cThese issues stemmed, in part, from the fact that secondary-market investors did not have access to accurate information concerning the value of the companies in which they were investing,\u201d Ms. White said.\n\nAn S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on Equidate.\n\nMr. Prasad says Equidate, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by a group of technology investors, has been working with regulators since 2014. In January, Equidate bought a regulated broker-dealer, which means that the deals made on Equidate must comply with securities rules and have some investor protection and disclosure.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on July 26, 2016, on page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Shining a Light on Hard-to-See Private Start-Ups.

Instead, she was greeted by teenagers and young children with their parents, who filled the small store to enjoy cake and chocolate frogs (a treat among wizards).\n\n\u201cLook at all the young kids in here,\u201d Ms. Stelter said, standing beside boxes of \u201cCursed Child.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in here for a book that\u2019s in print and on paper, not on an electric device. Once they read like that, they\u2019ll read for life.\u201d\n\nMany fans happily brought family members who were not old enough \u2014 or even born yet \u2014 for the celebrations of the original series.\n\nIn Atlanta, Erin Whitlock, 24, brought her 12-year-old brother Liam to a Barnes & Noble in the Edgewood neighborhood.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as big a fan as I am, and it\u2019s just really cool to be here tonight because he gets to experience what I grew up with,\u201d Ms. Whitlock said, noting that her brother visits Ms. Rowling\u2019s website Pottermore, where she regularly publishes new stories. \u201cThe wizarding world doesn\u2019t stop with the books. It goes with your imagination.\u201d\n\nJillEllyn Riley, 48, a writer and editor who lives in Cobble Hill, perused the novels at BookCourt with her sons, ages 13 and 19, who did not seem to mind the spectacle of their mother dressed as Sybil Trelawney, a professor at Hogwarts. Ms. Riley said she hosted monthly Harry Potter club meetings in the neighborhood with her younger son.\n\n\u201cWe came here to BookCourt for Book 7, all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cMy 13-year-old was 3, and I knew that later he would read the books and wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the midnight releases, but I knew he\u2019d know he had been there once.\u201d\n\nAubrey Nolan, 25, who planned the evening at BookCourt, said she wanted to keep the activities family friendly. All around her, children sipped cream soda floats they passed off as butterbeer and decorated wands with paint, sequins and string. Others had mug shots taken that resembled the wizards imprisoned at Azkaban.\n\nBookstores around the country embraced the theme, too, with Books of Wonder in Manhattan offering photos with owls (like Harry\u2019s Hedwig) and the Charles Deering Library at Northwestern University outside Chicago refereeing a Quidditch match, a sport played in the series.\n\nAt the Elliott Bay Book Company in Seattle, nearly 250 people showed up for what was billed as a Hogwarts reunion. And members of the Seattle Shakesbeerience performed the first few scenes from the play with Patrick Lennon \u2014 who said the group\u2019s motto is \u201cscript in one hand, drink in the other\u201d \u2014 as Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the group that aged along with Harry,\u201d Mr. Lennon, 30, said. \u201cOne of the actresses says she\u2019ll probably be crying through it. I might too.\u201d\n\nFor some, nothing was more important than getting their hands on the newest edition, even if it meant waiting alone or interrupting a vacation.\n\nAnnie Grandidge and Travis Dicks, tourists from New Castle, Australia, spent two and a half hours in line at the Barnes & Noble on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. And Ashley Johnson, 32, the actress who played Chrissy Seaver in the sitcom \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d recently moved to Brooklyn to work on NBC\u2019s \u201cBlindspot.\" She showed up at BookCourt by herself, knowing she would easily make friends with other Potter fans.\n\n\u201cI was a little angry that I didn\u2019t read these as I was growing up,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cI found them in my mid-20s and I never got to go wait in line for the original books, so to be a part of that I felt like I needed to go do it. We don\u2019t get to do this with a lot of things with how fast the world moves, and to wait in line for a book at midnight feels really special.\u201d\n\nMargaret Piraino, 24, dressed as Nymphadora Tonks, a half-blood witch, complete with rainbow hair and Potter-themed jewelry, attended the BookCourt party with her girlfriend, Laurel Detkin, a fellow Potter enthusiast. But this time was different.\n\n\u201cI grew up with Harry Potter and it\u2019s been my entire life, and my dad would go to Barnes & Noble with me every time there was a new release,\u201d Ms. Piraino, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said. \u201cAnd this year, my dad died in January and it\u2019s the first time I had to go on my own.\u201d\n\nIn Seattle, Dylan Blanford, 13, donned a long black robe and a yellow tie as a member of Hufflepuff, one of the four houses at Hogwarts, and said he was jealous that he was not at parties for the previous Harry Potter books. He started reading the books at age 5.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited because there\u2019s still this little 6-year-old jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry! Harry!\u2019 And there\u2019s also this 13-year-old jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry! Harry!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited because it\u2019s not the end, forever, you know?\u201d\n\nCorrection: July 31, 2016 An earlier version of a photo caption in the accompanying slide show reversed the positions of Katelynn Kenney and Liane Pippin.

The company has doubled its revenues year-on-year and will turn over \u00a315m in the year to March 2014.\n\nPart of Rodial\u2019s allure is the brand\u2019s eye-catching product names. \u201cSome of our products sound scary,\u201d admits Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cWe have Snake Serum, Dragon\u2019s Blood and Bee Venom. They are all very safe but we like to play with the names of our ingredients to create a talking point.\u201d\n\nProducts start at \u00a319 up to \u00a3375 for Bee Venom 24 Carat Gold Serum.\n\nThe company\u2019s love affair with edgy names began with Snake Serum, launched in 2010. \u201cWhen a snake bites you, it paralyses the muscles,\u201d explains Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cThe main ingredient in our Serum is a synthetic venom, called syn-ake, which performs the same way as viper venom.\u201d\n\nSnake Serum was unveiled with great fanfare. Adverts featured a black viper coiling around the products; Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham were rumoured to be fans and sales skyrocketed.\n\n\u201cThere was the occasional person who didn\u2019t like the product because they hated snakes but, mostly, it caused a lot of excitement,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cSo we thought, 'What shall we do next?\u2019 \u201d\n\nDragon\u2019s Blood is a bright red resin from a tree native to the Canary Islands and Morocco. The sap has been used for medicinal purposes since the times of the Roman Empire. \u201cIt helps to take down redness and irritation and I loved the name,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis.\n\nThe skin plumping products are marketed as an alternative to dermal fillers, the so-called \u201cliquid facelift\u201d. \u201cWe added peptides and hyaluronic acid to make it really high tech and now Dragon\u2019s Blood is our bestselling range.\u201d\n\nBee Venom completed the animal-themed range. \u201cLots of customers were asking for it,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cWe took bee venom and the latest stem cell technology to develop a range for more mature skin.\u201d\n\nThe business has made other bold moves in recent years. In 2012, the Nip + Fab brand launched a product called Tummy Fix.\n\nAccording to the e-commerce site\u2019s analysis, 40pc of the people buying the product were men. This convinced Ms Hatzistefanis to start researching the market for men\u2019s skincare.\n\n\u201cWomen in London spend about \u00a31,500 a year on skincare,\u201d she says. \u201cMen in London spend \u00a31,100 \u2013 it\u2019s not that far off.\u201d\n\nThe Nip + Man range launched in May 2013. Products include Manotox, the men\u2019s alternative to Botox, the Bicep Fix and the Ab Fix, with Gemmoslim to battle the bulge.\n\nNip + Man currently represents just 5pc of the company\u2019s turnover, compared with Rodial, which has 55pc, and Nip + Fab with 40pc. \u201cBut it\u2019s growing fast,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis.\n\nThere has been one wrinkle in the firm\u2019s growth trajectory, however. \u201cA couple of years ago there was a big issue with a plastic surgeon who talked to a newspaper and said that our products didn\u2019t do what they promised and could be harmful,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cThat was very shocking.\u201d\n\nRodial\u2019s lawyers sent a letter to the surgeon asking him to show evidence to back up his claims. A media storm ensued. \u201cPeople said that we were threatening the plastic surgeon for expressing his opinion. The media called us bullies. Our integrity as a business was in question. Whenever we tried to clarify things, we couldn\u2019t make it right. It was a really dark time.\u201d\n\nIt took four months for the situation to blow over. Sales remained stable throughout but Rodial\u2019s relationships with its customer base were sorely tested.\n\nToday, the business is thriving. The products remain a firm favourite of celebrity make-up artists for the likes of Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga, helping to generate positive press for the brand.\n\nThe company is expanding its presence in department stores such as Harrods by introducing its own beauty counters. TV shopping is another growth area and airport sales are booming. Bestsellers, or \u201cclassics\u201d, are a rarity, with customers demanding a continuous stream of new products.\n\n\u201cBeauty has become more like fashion,\u201d explains Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cYou used to launch a range and then maybe add one product a season. Now, the customer expects something new every six to eight weeks.\u201d\n\nAs new lines are introduced, poorly performing products are phased out. This is a \u201cbrutal\u201d process, Ms Hatzistefanis admits.\n\nA new range called Super Acids, described as an alternative to chemical peels, is due to hit the shops this month, to be followed by a make-up range in September.\n\nAfter 14 years, Ms Hatzistefanis, who owns 100pc of the business with her husband, still enjoys the cut and thrust of the beauty industry. She has no plans to sell up any time soon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much you can achieve with a skincare product now,\u201d she says. \u201cJust imagine what we\u2019re going to be able to do in 10 years time.\u201d",

        "text": "For all the delays in rebuilding New York\u2019s Ground Zero site and the tortured process to bring down the wounded tower that used to belong to Deutsche Bank (see related article), there are increasing signs of progress at the site.\n\nDecontamination is set to resume at the Deutsche Bank building within days and the construction of two out of three World Trade Center skyscrapers began last week. \u201cThere has not been this much going on at the site since the cleanup concluded almost six years ago,\u201d said developer Larry Silverstein in a speech.\n\nThe rebirth of the two sites\u2014those that once housed the World Trade Center and the Deutsche Bank building \u2013 represent just the latest reinvention of one of Manhattan\u2019s longest-settled areas. It\u2019s also a reminder that, in New York, rebirth and renovation are recurring processes. Under the Deutsche Bank building, for example, resides a lot of not-quite-buried history.\n\nBefore 9/11, the World Trade Center was condemned by some for destroying a thriving neighborhood of small electronics shops known as Radio Row. What became 1 Bankers Trust Plaza (and later, the Deutsche Bank building after the German corporation acquired Bankers Trust) contributed further destruction: Two blocks largely filled with venerable four- and five-story walk-ups, most of them with mom-and-pop businesses on the ground floor, were demolished to build it. And while Radio Row extended to the site\u2019s northern tip, the rest of the plot was situated in a neighborhood of a different character.\n\nCortlandt Street, New York\u2019s Radio Row, with shops selling all sorts of radio equipment circa 1930\u2019s.Getty Images\n\nThe New York Times surveyed the environs in a 1971 article describing the construction of the World Trade Center and the Bankers Trust Tower. The article noted, for example, a bar on Cedar Street (a block of which would disappear under the bank\u2019s structure) that was serving \u201c45-cent gin specials to take advantage of the big daytime trade from construction workers.\u201d The adjacent street was filled with \u201csaloons with quick-lunch steam tables, a variety of shops, an ale house, [and] the back of the American Stock Exchange.\u201d (The latter still stands.)\n\nOne local restaurant owner waxed nostalgic about the \u201cgreat hole being gouged out\u201d for Bankers Trust because he had been born on the very spot: \u201cI remember it was a coldwater walk-up flat with wood stove and everybody had separate private toilets outside in the yard,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cAnd the kids in the summer would go down to South Ferry and swim in the buff.\u201d\n\nOCTOBER 13: Aerial view of the site where World Trade Center is to be built.New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nIn the earliest days of Manhattan, swimming would have been easy at the site of the Bankers Trust tower: At least part of the lot was located in the Hudson River. In New York\u2019s earliest years, the city sold parcels of land that were under water at high tide but more or less dry at low tide, according to Ann Buttenweiser\u2019s Manhattan Water-Bound: Manhattan\u2019s Waterfront From the Seventeenth Century to the Present. Despite the plentiful space on the island, it was common to buy such plots and then bolster them with landfill. And so the earliest existing property record for the block that would one day hold the Bankers Trust building is a \u201cindenture\u201d from 1704 which describes the spot as located \u201cwithout the north gate of the City of New Yorke bounded\u2026 in the West by the Hudson\u2019s River at low water mark\u2026\u201d\n\nBy the 1820s, the future bank site had been fully converted to dry land and subdivided. But it wasn\u2019t a high-rent district. For decades, owing to its proximity to the end of the island, it was a place where new arrivals and immigrants put down their bags before moving to more permanent lodging. Edgar Alan Poe, for example, briefly rented a room in a boarding house on the site in 1844 before moving uptown.\n\nThe arrival of the first elevated train in Manhattan, which ran north along the plot, didn\u2019t improve the atmosphere. From 1870 until it was taken down in 1940, what became the Ninth Avenue El made the area noisy, dark and forbidding. Little surprise, perhaps, that illegal operations seemed to flourish in the area.\n\nThe Deutsche Bank building, center right. The bank has reached a preliminary settlement with its lead insurer, the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, to allow the 40-story office tower, damaged in the terrorist attacks, to be demolished as early as July, 2003.Mark Lennihan \u2014 AP\n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, references to the future Bankers Trust location turned up regularly in the Times, which reported raids on speakeasies, a fraud artist who \u201cout-Ponzied Ponzi,\u201d and an illegal horse-betting operation that went by the name of the \u201cParagon Institute of Raceology.\u201d One of the more colorful examples appeared on October 2, 1942: \u201cNine men were arrested \u2026 in what the police called a \u2018million-dollar-a-year wire service for poolroom bookmakers and other gamblers on horse racing\u2026\u201d The ringleader was Thomas J. Ryan, \u201ca former member of the notorious Purple Gang of prohibition bootleggers and other criminals from Detroit and former muscle man for the late Moses L. Annenberg\u2026\u201d According to the article, Ryan had been warned of the impending raid, but said he wasn\u2019t worried about it. \u201cBig Shot Ryan made remarks over the phone that he wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone,\u201d a deputy police chief exulted, \u201cbut when we went there this morning he was hiding in a closet with a secret telephone, with a valise all packed ready to leave the city, and $16,000 in cash.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all gangsters. A couple of blocks south, for decades, was what the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City referred to as the Syrian quarter. As the Guide put it, \u201calthough the fez has given way to the snap-brim, and the narghile has been abandoned for cigarettes, the coffee houses and the tobacco and confectionery shops of the Levantines still remain.\u201d It was a vibrant neighborhood where baklava and shish kebab, then considered exotic foods, could be found \u2013 a small cultural foothold just a few blocks from Wall Street, the citadel of American capitalism.\n\nSee also: Features on 9/11\u2014Here\u2019s How Much Lower Manhattan Has Changed Since the 9/11 Attacks (2016)\n\nBut the World Trade Center would cut off Greenwich Street, the area\u2019s main artery.

        "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla. - It was on the plane from Shanghai to Beijing last year that Dorothy Lipson of Delray Beach, Fla., suddenly began to cough up blood: first in streaks, then in frightening, tissue-soaking spoonfuls.\n\nTing-Li Wang/The New York Times\n\nPatients like Ilse Kaplan, left, receive more personal attention from Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky in exchange for an annual fee of about $1,650.\n\nTing-Li Wang/The New York Times\n\nA lower patient load means Dr. Kaminetsky's waiting room is often empty, but staff members still keep a supply of snacks there just in case.\n\nBut Mrs. Lipson, who was in China visiting an expatriate daughter, was lucky on two counts. First, her daughter happens to run a corporation that builds gleaming Western-style hospitals in China; Ms. Lipson was rushed to the Beijing hospital on landing. And second, Mrs. Lipson's internist back home in Florida is Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky, one of a new breed of \"concierge\" or \"boutique\" doctors who, in exchange for a yearly cash retainer, lavish time, phone calls and attention on patients, using the latest in electronic communications to streamline their care.\n\nSince its debut in 1996, concierge medicine has evoked criticism from many corners. Some ethicists say it is exacerbating the inequities in American health care. Insurance regulators have raised concerns about fraud. Government watchdogs, worried that it threatens the tenuous equilibrium of the health care system, are keeping an eye on trends.\n\n\"Concierge care is like a new country club for the rich,\" Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said at a joint economic committee hearing in Congress last year. \"The danger is that if a large number of doctors choose to open up these types of practices, the health care system will become even more inequitable than it is today.\"\n\nBut for Mrs. Lipson, who pays $1,650 a year, the niceties enabled by concierge medicine can make all the difference.\n\nDr. Kaminetsky was in daily touch with her doctors in Beijing. E-mail messages, X-ray reports and digitalized images flew back and forth. When the bleeding was stabilized and Mrs. Lipson returned home, Dr. Kaminetsky immediately connected her with a local specialist for a biopsy of her diseased lungs, and then with infectious disease experts for treatment of the unusual infection that was found.\n\nMrs. Lipson's long convalescence was seamless, with none of the snags that can magnify the misery of serious illness: no long hours in strange waiting rooms, no lost X-ray or culture reports, no contradictory pronouncements by specialists confused by missing information. Dr. Kaminetsky's office coordinated all her appointments, tests and treatments. He personally telephoned her with all results and saw her as often as necessary to make sure everything went smoothly.\n\nNow, still on medication over 18 months later, Mrs. Lipson applauds her foresight in signing up for this deluxe model of medical care. The yearly expense, she points out, is far smaller than more traditional luxuries like cruises or late-model cars. \"I highly recommend it,\" she said. \"It's well worth the money.\"\n\nAnyone searching the country for a group of patients who are perfectly happy with their medical care, neither brutalized by the system nor fearful that the onset of a serious illness will plunge them into a morass of confusion and neglect, need look no farther than Dr. Kaminetsky's waiting room here in Boca Raton.\n\nNot that the waiting room usually has anyone in it. One promise made to patients paying for concierge service is that waiting will not be a part of their health care experience. Patients are guaranteed that phone calls will be returned promptly, appointments will be scheduled on a same-day basis if necessary, and appointment times will be honored. A bowl of fruit salad and platters of bagels and sponge cake set out for patients in the waiting room can go barely touched over the course of a day, and the television often plays to an empty couch.\n\nA relatively simple tradeoff is responsible: the extra fees collected from patients let concierge doctors, who leave regular practice for concierge medicine, slash their caseloads. Before Dr. Kaminetsky became a concierge doctor five years ago he had 2,500 patients in his practice - a standard number for most primary care internists. His list now numbers 600.\n\nSick and well alike, patients are delighted with the results.\n\nJoan Holzman, 69, takes no medicines and has no health problems; she comes to the office once a year for a physical exam, an X-ray, an electrocardiogram and blood tests. \"I adore it,\" Ms. Holzman said. \"Before, wherever you went you felt like cattle. But everyone here is top-notch - the doctors, the secretaries, the nurses. They're warm, like family. It's a wonderful feeling of security.\"",

We're the front lines, man, fleas fighting a giant.''\n\nIt is a clear, crisp, gorgeous winter afternoon in the high desert in Nevada, and Michael Heizer, who has spent the past 32 years and many millions of mostly other people's dollars constructing ''City'' -- one of the biggest sculptures any modern artist has ever built, one and a quarter miles long and more than a quarter of a mile wide -- is in a state of extreme agitation, even for him. His pique is rising as he maneuvers his truck down a bumpy mountain pass, filling the truck's cabin with cigar smoke. I sense that he's rather enjoying himself.\n\nWe are driving through Murphy Gap. Pinyon and juniper cluster along the slopes on either side. This narrow, serpentine passage of astonishing beauty cuts through the Golden Gate Range, far from civilization. Aside from Heizer's voice and the truck's engine, there is an endless, empty, engulfing silence.\n\nCoal Valley, on the eastern side of the mountain range, is a desolate, flat plain of yellow rabbit brush and silver sage for grazing cattle. To the west, Heizer's valley, Garden Valley, is vast and nearly uninhabited. Size is deceptive out here. ''City'' looks from the edge of the valley like a low-lying bump, barely visible. When you drive just a mile from it, south across the valley, it basically disappears into the brush. But picture a sculpture the size of the Washington Mall, nearly from the steps of the Capitol to the Washington Monument, swallowing many of the museums on either side. That's how big it is. Only once you're inside do you see all the mounds, pits, passageways, plazas, ramps and terraced dirt, most of the sculpture having been dug below ground level, masked from outside by berms. The shapes echo the mountains. ''I'm not selling the view,'' Heizer contradicts when I mention this. ''You can't even see the landscape unless you're standing at the edge of the sculpture.'' True. Even so, the echoes are plain as day.\n\nWe are maybe 30 miles from Nellis Air Force Base and the military's supersecret Area 51, and more than 100 miles from Yucca Mountain, where the federal government, if all goes as planned, will begin to collect the nation's nuclear waste in 2010. Trains will transport the waste from across the country, through the middle of Atlanta and Chicago and Salt Lake City and Kansas City, to Caliente, a town just north of here. From there, more than 300 miles of track will have to be laid, at a cost of more than $1 billion, to carry the waste the rest of the way.\n\nAs it is currently conceived, the route will cut across Garden Valley, within ear- and eyeshot of Heizer's sculpture and the ranch right next to it where he lives, a kind of survivalist compound of cinder block and solar panels, an oasis of cottonwoods and wild plum trees in the middle of a wide, empty plain. Having moved long ago to this virtual end of the earth, and having also moved heaven and earth to build in isolation his immense sculpture, Heizer now finds the federal government is plotting, as he sees things, to ruin it and him.\n\nHeizer knows it's highly unlikely that he or anyone else will suddenly stop Yucca cold, but he says he's hoping at least to persuade Department of Energy officials at this 11th hour to redirect the tracks next door through Coal Valley and Murphy Gap. Of course he is deeply pessimistic. ''I've always been a pessimist,'' he tells me, ''but now I think things are going to get really, really bad.'' Squinting into a fresh plume of cigar smoke, which rises like a dark cloud around him, he starts imagining first the rail, then wells, then electric power lines invading the valley, while ''sniveling toady'' politicians, as he calls them, do nothing.\n\nHis soliloquy crescendos, linking defense contractors like Kellogg Brown & Root and Bechtel to the government as a sinister cabal machinating against him -- ''I wouldn't be surprised if they sent out a hit squad to kill me!'' -- when the silence of Murphy Gap is suddenly shattered by a heart-stopping boom.\n\nAn F-16 buzzes our truck. It looks as if it can't be more than 100 feet overhead, turned sideways to maneuver low through the snaking pass. Then as quickly as it appears, it's gone.\n\nWho knows? I think. Even paranoids may be right sometimes.",

        "text": "John McCallum as a convict on the run in Bethanl Green in Robert Hamer\u2019s 1947 film It Always Rains on Sunday. Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com\n\nI've been told that London's reputation for fog is not only due to the fact that it used to be foggy. It was also because cash-strapped postwar film-makers found it convenient to shroud their scenes in mist because they wouldn't have to build so much of the set \u2013 just one or two house fronts instead of a street. If this story is an urban myth, no matter, as it tells a truth about London on film. The city's greatest gift to the movie camera is its atmospherics, its fog, rain and darkness.\n\nIn ordinary daylight it is obstinately factual. If cinema likes to make cities into dream versions of themselves, London doesn't join in. The brick terraces, the railings, pavements, bollards and postboxes remain themselves. They won't soar like Manhattan or perform like Rome, and you can't imagine Marilyn doing her blown-up skirt thing on London's streets. They reject fantasy. But they permit mystery, the sense that there is something hidden around the corner, which is where the atmospherics come in.\n\nNext week, the Barbican is starting an intensive mini-season of films about London, opening with Robert Hamer's It Always Rains on Sunday, of 1947, in which a woman tries to hide an escaped convict (who is also her ex-lover) in the tiny terraced house she shares with her husband, stepdaughters and son. Its structure is roughly Shakespearean, with a central tragedy underscored by subplots, while its setting is a prototype EastEnders, a Bethnal Green of crowded markets and beaten-up streets.\n\nIt's claustrophobic, its tight geographic boundaries only opening up with a concluding night-time chase through docks and railway yards. Other worlds are hoped-for or remembered, but the residents of the movie are imprisoned by poverty and bad weather. The rain of the title is a jailer, but along with the darkness at the end it also brings a kind of transcendence, without which there would be nothing but the ordinary.\n\nThe screening of It Always Rains on Sunday will be accompanied by a talk by the Londonophile writer Iain Sinclair, who is also the presiding spirit of the Urban Wandering season. Where Flann O'Brien imagined a policeman who rode his bike so much that he exchanged atoms with it, it may be that Sinclair's feet are by now half-pavement, so extensively has he tramped the capital.\n\nMany of the films share Sinclair's interest in psychogeography, a concept or approach whereby the physical, the personal, the mythic and the historic are knotted together in unravellable skeins. The knotting is done mostly through walking, with the Munros of suburbia doggedly scaled. Its enemies are commodification, the translation of pieces of city into sales tools for estate agents and tourism, and optimistic Olympo-babble. The greatest of such films is Patrick Keiller's simply titled London, an extended wander nourished with literary references and a narration with the measured tread of a long-distance walk.\n\nThe Barbican's season also tries hard to recognise the versions of London experienced by immigrants and minorities, as described by the voices of interviewees in Twilight City and The Stuart Hall Project. It's also showing Julien Temple's London: The Modern Babylon, an archival compilation that aims to reveal the city's subcultures but ends up as a too-predicable trawl through the 20th century: cockneys, the Blitz, immigration, punks.\n\nJohn Landis's American Werewolf in London. Reading this on a mobile? Click here\n\nFor light relief, there is John Landis's An American Werewolf in London (1981), which wields a familiar arsenal of landmarks, such as Trafalgar Square and Tower Bridge, and has a hard-up nurse living in Kensington, which was improbable even before the Thatcher property boom. It redeems itself by making Tottenham Court Road tube station into a nightmare of endless subways, and with a masterful scene in a blue movie theatre near Piccadilly Circus, where the moans of the porn actors blend indistinguishably with the groans of the werewolf's victims.\n\nAs in It Always Rains on Sunday, the programme shows a persistent fascination with poverty and the East End. Even Werewolf features a group of rough drinkers in what is now a desirable part of Wapping. Mike Leigh, in Naked, savours as always the worn hardness of London spaces. In other films, kebab shops and minicab offices light up the night. Sometimes, poverty becomes a bit like fog \u2013 too much so \u2013 a way of making complacent house fronts more fascinating.\n\nOne of the season's more fascinating curios is The Smithsons on Housing of 1970, whose producer, BS Johnson, was also a fine novelist of London's half-buried miseries. In this film the architects Alison and Peter Smithson face the camera, speaking with a methodical glumness quite like Sinclair's and Keiller's, with the difference that, as architects, they are supposed to be proposing a better world. They talk of making \"pleasure-leisure places\" and \"a new Venice\" in London's docks, but it doesn't make them smile, and they seem to know already that their Robin Hood Gardens estate, then under construction, would succumb to vandalism and neglect and would be scheduled for early demolition. As it has. \"If the culture of cities was a criterion for joining the Common Market,\" says Alison Smithson miserably, \"then any African state would have as good a chance as London's.\"\n\nUrban Wandering, then, represents a powerful theme in films about London: the feeling that, beneath smug architecture, and wrapped in fog, rain or dark, there is something more compelling and complex, if not always nice. It might be a werewolf on the tube, or a secret from a housewife's past, or the fact (revealed by Keiller) that Verlaine and Rimbaud once shared a home on the site where the phallic BT Tower now stands, as an inadvertent monument to their love. Titles in the season restate the theme repeatedly: Underground, Hidden City, Under Night Streets, The London Nobody Knows.\n\nGloss and glamour are frowned on and at times it can get too much. Why can't the sun shine? Why can't these people smile? Is it their blisters from all that walking? Until that is, you chance upon a DVD of a Richard Curtis film, Love Actually or Notting Hill, in which everything looks like a Christmas card even when there's no snow. Then you become immensely grateful for a bit of complexity and gloom.",

        "text": "New York\u2019s international graffiti mecca 5 Pointz was erased overnight when the paintings were buffed over on the orders of the property's owners.\n\nThe five-story warehouse complex in Queens, which has hosted a curated selection of graffiti since 2002, was a popular gathering place for art fans; its murals were a familiar sight to New York subway passengers as they passed through the Long Island City neighborhood. But in August, city officials granted Jerry and David Wolkoff, who own the building, permission to demolish the site.\n\nThe surprise overnight whitewash brought condemnation from artists, fans and volunteers who had gathered at the spot on Tuesday, many in tears.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s super disrespectful is that the whole thing about 5 Pointz is: it\u2019s legal painting,\" said 5 Pointz volunteer Rebekah Kennedy. \"For someone to come in and wash it away \u2026 that's the biggest vandal.\"\n\nShe said that before the destruction, volunteers had been working on a way to preserve the art or the building as a landmark. \u201cTo just take it away is the biggest 'fuck you' that can happen,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, volunteers taped large pieces of white to the walls inside the building\u2019s loading dock center, where halal cart workers were still driving in and out of the yard. People had taken markers to the signs in tribute: \u201cWe played by the rules,\u201d read one. Another bore a quote from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg address, which was delivered 150 years ago, today: \u201cWe are met on a great battlefield of that war.\u201d\n\nOwner Jerry Wolkoff defended the overnight destruction in an interview with NBC 4 New York. \"I can imagine going one piece, one piece, and going through hell, torture to everybody,\" he said. \"So I said, 'Let me do it one time and end this torture one time,\u2019\u201d he said. He compared the action to forcing a child to take medicine.\n\n\"In the new building we're going to let them come back, and it's going to be similar and better,\" Wolkoff said, explaining that the new building will have a 60-foot wraparound wall for graffiti. \"They're upset with me now, but it's the right thing for both of us.\u201d\n\nHe later expanded his defence in an interview with New York magazine: \"I told the police to be there. The last thing I wanted was any confrontation. I didn't want any of them to be arrested. I have so much respect for them. It's my building, I can paint on it. I would feel terrible if someone got arrested.\"\n\nComedy writer Joe Garden, who passes the spot on his way to work, called the destruction \"an abomination\" and said it \"really seems spiteful and unnecessary, verging on cruel\".\n\nConfirmed 5 Pointz graffiti Mecca was painted over last night pic.twitter.com/tweDokQR2Y\n\nPainting over 5 Pointz before tearing it down is one of the most artistically and culturally disrespectful moves I've seen in a while. Damn.\n\nDanny Simmons, a gallery owner and artist who testified in a lawsuit brought by 5 Pointz representatives, said the building has been \u201ca repository of hip-hop history and a place of beauty and wonder\u201d. Simmons is the older brother of hip-hop mogul Russell, and Joseph, or Rev Run, of Run DMC, and all three were closely tied to the rise of hip-hop culture.\n\nDanny Simmons said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a major tourist attraction for the city \u2013 a place where young and old could go for free and let their imaginations run wild. It was an inspiration to art\u2019s free spirit and spoke volumes to artists like myself about color and form. With the painting over and razing of this building, the arts and NYC has been sorely diminished. It will be missed, but the spirit of art for and by the people lives on.\u201d\n\nArtists have been painting on the property since the early 1990s, with permission from the Wolkoffs. But the owners decided in 2010 to demolish the building to make room for two luxury residential towers.\n\n5 Pointz representatives, led by curator Jonathan Cohen, also known as Meres One, had been at odds with the Wolkoffs for several years after an artist was seriously injured in 2009 when an outdoor staircase broke. New York\u2019s building department ordered the largest structure in the complex to close following the incident, but in mid-October the building was still standing.\n\nSince the city granted the property owners permission to demolish the building, Meres and fellow curator Marie Cecile Flageul have been fighting a losing battle. With a band of other graffiti artists, 5 Pointz launched a lawsuit against the Wolkoffs, but federal district judge Frederic Block ruled last week in the Wolkoffs' favour.\n\nOn Saturday, the 5 Pointz crew held what would be the final rally to preserve the building. There were also plans to appeal Block\u2019s decision, and petitions from around the world were submitted in support.\n\nThe decision to paint over the murals comes just after Banksy held a month-long New York residency in October, which ended with him writing a brief comment on his website to \"Save 5 Pointz.\"",

But in this case, Francis is leaving out the Israeli leader who matters most.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as head of government, is the key decision-maker in any peace negotiations with the Palestinians. Yet the Pope\u2019s invitation from a Bethlehem mass on Sunday was extended not to Netanyahu but to Shimon Peres, the famously dovish 90-year-old statesman whose seven-year term in the largely symbolic office of president expires in two months.\n\nPeres readily accepted the Pope\u2019s invitation to travel to the Vatican for \u201ca heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace,\u201d as Francis put it. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said a quick yes, too. That puts together in a room two men of peace who routinely voice the need for a two-state solution to the as-yet-intractable conflict\u2013and who, according to contemporaneous news reports, met discreetly several times in 2011.\n\nAs Peres tells it, he and Abbas came within a whisker of fashioning an agreement that would have resolved the matter by agreeing on the terms for fashioning a state called \u201cPalestine\u201d beside Israel.\n\nBut Netanyahu forbad Peres from closing the deal, according to Peres, who recounted the tortured history earlier this month to an Israeli television station, shortly after the apparent collapse of the Kerry negotiations.\n\nAnd while there is nothing at all wrong with prayer, least of all for peace, the Pope\u2019s invitation truly was one that neither side could refuse. The Israelis and Palestinians have been talking so long about peace \u2013 20 years now, since the breakthrough known as the Oslo Accords that introduced then then-exciting idea of sitting down face-to-face with the enemy \u2013 that to be seen rejecting talks is to be viewed as the villain.\n\nBoth sides have strong incentives to be perceived as inclined toward an agreement, and both sides have strong incentives to avoid the particulars required to produce one. Which is why an invitation to keep things as vague as praying for peace is something of a godsend, especially coming from the most charismatic religious figure in the world. Where\u2019s the downside in that?\n\nNone that\u2019s apparent. But only a fool would rule out this Pope. After barely a year in office, the Argentine Francis has shown himself nothing if not a man of this world, shrewd, and deeply committed to challenging the status quo. It was en route through Bethlehem to the mass where he delivered his seemingly airy invitation that Francis made his unscheduled, quietly thrilling stop at the Separation Barrier. He prayed in silence, and briefly touched his head against the gritty concrete, possibly the way a ram does, in warning.",

It\u2019s been a very busy and exciting time at Apple and I\u2019d like to review some of the highlights of our June quarter. We hosted our best ever Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference last month with over 20 million people from around the world watching our keynote session, which is the a record. We\u2019ve had overwhelming response from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has been redesigned with a fresh look and powerful new apps and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store. With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways.\n\nCustomers can start on activity like writing an email on one device and pass it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They will even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. These are features that only Apple can deliver. With iOS 8, we have opened over 4000 APIs providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, enables wide use of Touch ID to securely authenticate users within apps and lets developers further customize the user experience with major extensibility features such as third-party keyboards.\n\nWe have also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience within building Apple platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire classes of unsafe code and generates apps that run lightning fast. It\u2019s easy to learn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new categories of apps. We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift will result in a huge leap forward for the Apple ecosystem and we can\u2019t wait to what developers will create with Yosemite, iOS 8 and Swift.\n\nWhen we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating system for iPhone. Over the years we\u2019ve extended it to the iPod family with iPod Touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, accessories and services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant ecosystem. We\u2019re extending iOS in even more dimensions as customers around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives, at home, at school, at work and on the go. We\u2019re putting a huge effort into delivering the best experience to our customers wherever they use iOS. That includes a safe and intuitive user interface for driving, called CarPlay, which is being integrated by 29 major car brands including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo; and after-market systems like Pioneer and Alpine.\n\nWe\u2019ve created a new tool for developers called HealthKit, which allows health and fitness apps work to together and empowers customers to choose what health data they share. We\u2019re taking the first steps in this area in collaboration with the Mayo clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive data from a blood pressure app, for example and share it with a physician, or a nutrition app can inform fitness apps how many calories are being consumed each day. Our ARM health app will provide an easy to read dashboard of all health and fitness data.\n\nWe\u2019re enabling new ways to control light and doors and thermostats and other connected devices around the house using Siri with the HomeKit feature of iOS 8. And in the Enterprise, we are including new security, productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to enterprise customers around the world. We are working together to provide companies access to the power of Big Data analytics, right on every employee\u2019s iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we will collaborate to bring over 100 Mobile First apps to enterprise clients, each addressing a specific industry need or opportunity.\n\nThis is a radical step for Enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity for Apple but more importantly, it\u2019s great for productivity and creativity of our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the car, to the workplace, home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be and we\u2019re incredibly excited about our plans.\n\nTurning to our financial results\u2026\n\nLINK: Seeking Appha\u2019s Earnings Call Transcript\n\nFollow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter at @philiped.

        "text": "Even though the forms that have become common musical currency \u2014 sonatas, symphonies, concertos \u2014 underwent lengthy, complex processes of development, we sometimes talk about them as if their materialization was some discrete, easily pinpointed event. A prime example is the string quartet, which is commonly said to have been \u201cinvented\u201d by Franz Joseph Haydn around the middle of the 18th century. In fact, the development of the form unfolded gradually, tentatively and in overlapping phases.\n\nAn inventive program in the summer series of the Society for Historically Informed Performance (SoHIP) is meant to tell at least part of that story. Titled \u201cBirth of the String Quartet,\u201d it includes pieces for two violins, viola, and cello by Georg Philipp Telemann, Johann Friedrich Fasch, and Franz Xaver Richter, three composers in whose work the quartet grows out of its Baroque origins, and ends with a quartet from Haydn\u2019s Opus 1 set.\n\nThe three performances come courtesy of the aptly named Emergence Quartet: violinists Emily Dahl and Lisa Goddard, violist Zoe Kemmerling, and cellist Emily Davidson. The period-instrument group formed last fall, and gave its first performance earlier this year. It was the brainchild of Davidson, a Baroque cellist who was looking to form a chamber ensemble, and was surprised that there didn\u2019t seem to be a regularly performing quartet in Boston\u2019s thriving early-music scene.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a perfect outlet to bring together general classical music fans \u2014 almost everybody loves the string quartet \u2014 to the period-performance angle and explore this repertoire,\u201d Davidson said in a recent phone interview. \u201cWhat kind of music [the string quartet] was coming out of, and the first quartets that were on the scene.\u201d\n\nThe Telemann sonata that opens the program offers a glimpse of the Baroque rhetoric out of which the quartet emerged. Sonatas of this era usually featured a number of solo instruments and a bass line, with figuration that functioned as the harmonic guide for a continuo player (usually on a keyboard).\n\nWhat\u2019s notable about the Telemann piece, Davidson explained, is that there is no continuo part indicated. The cello line simply functions on its own. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big defining factor, if we start to see stand-alone bass lines, rather than a line with a figured bass above it that\u2019s intended to be played by a chordal instrument,\u201d she said.\n\nA sonata by Fasch (1688-1758), by contrast, was actually written with continuo in mind. Yet, Davidson said, \u201cthe writing works quite well in the string quartet style,\u201d without accompaniment. And whereas the Telemann is harmonically conventional, Fasch\u2019s writing is unexpectedly adventurous. \u201cIt\u2019s very dramatic, very surprising music \u2014 Fasch was always sort of pushing the boundaries and writing these outrageous, almost shocking harmonies that were far beyond his time.\u201d\n\nA piece by Richter (1709-89) is the first on the concert to use the title \u201cquartet.\u201d Here, another part of the puzzle drops into place: the equality of all four instrumental parts. \u201cRichter really starts playing with the role of each instrument,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cYou see a lot of melodies being passed off \u2014 where the viola\u2019s usually just playing harmony, we\u2019ll get a moment where it takes over. The cello will often switch off from a bass line role and jump up into the tenor clef, which is an exciting new move.\u201d\n\nGiven the adventurous writing by these two rather obscure composers, Haydn\u2019s G-major Quartet may seem surprisingly conventional. Its five-movement lineup resembles that of a divertimento, an older form, more than what we think of as a string quartet. The melodic writing centers almost exclusively on the first violin, with the three other instruments in a secondary, accompanying role. None of Haydn\u2019s later innovations are present. And yet, there is an unmistakably idiomatic feel to the music, as though it offered a distant foreshadowing of what was now on the horizon.\n\nAsked what she hoped listeners might take from the performances, Davidson hoped it would broaden the idea of what a string quartet can be \u2014 both in terms of the repertoire and of the Emergence\u2019s sound. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice to sort of push the years back and hear where those sounds were coming out of, and understand that a quartet can make a number of different aesthetics and create a number of different sound worlds just by the style of writing and the setup of the piece. There\u2019s a lot more variety than we\u2019re aware of.\u201d",

It\u2019s hard to find a major coffee company that doesn\u2019t have a recurring home delivery option.

In April, for instance, Peet\u2019s hired digital marketing agency Razorfish to overhaul its e-commerce platform, which offers subscriptions for both coffee and tea, at various prices based on the coffee bean or tea leaf.\n\nNik Bauman, Tonx co-founder and now Blue Bottle\u2019s Director of Digital Product, admits that in terms of offering a subscription, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing something completely revolutionary.\u201d Rather, he explains, \u201cWe\u2019re sweating the details.\u201d What type of coffee you want, at what cadence\u2014and in the perfect packaging\u2014should be a top-shelf experience.\n\nThe acquisition was warmly welcomed by Tonx, which needed a jolt of energy to move from savoring a strong digital following toward attempting to become a household name. \u201cJumping over that chasm and getting to real brand recognition in the marketplace\u2014you can\u2019t rush that,\u201d Bauman says. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t enjoy putting money behind the phrase \u2018brand building\u2019.\u201d By aligning with Blue Bottle, Tonx was getting the boost of a proven brand.\n\nBlue Bottle already had a skeletal subscription service. The idea of bringing on a technical partner to optimize the existing system had been percolating for a while. \u201cDavid [Bowman, Blue Bottle\u2019s CFO] and James [Freeman, Blue Bottle's CEO] had been looking at Tonx before I called them,\u201d Bauman says.\n\nFor founders known for obsessing about single origin beans, the blend of the two companies is surprisingly smooth. Blue Bottle is known for high quality control standards, refusing to outsource any offering, even down to its pastries. Freeman says though he greatly admires Tonx, the idea of an acquisition was, for a short time, a major philosophical hurdle. His biggest challenge was understanding that \u201cit\u2019s okay to not make it yourself sometimes,\u201d he says with a chuckle. His team was behind the merger from early on. \u201cSometimes the reason to have people on your team is to listen to them,\u201d he further concedes.\n\nBlue Bottle at Home arrives at a time when, thanks to the ever-expanding subscription economy, you can have everything from beauty samples to exotic foods delivered straight to your door on a recurring basis. But Bauman notes that an off-the-shelf subscription model doesn\u2019t actually fit that many businesses. He warns that simply getting someone to sign up isn\u2019t the goal, and in fact, overselling your product up front is a great way to lose a potential long-term customer. \u201cIf you subscribe to paper towels and you get two bundles of six, you have 12 paper towel rolls sitting around,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nOptimizing the Blue Bottle at Home experience isn\u2019t just about looking at a virtual dashboard, though the engineering team does collect customer data to improve the overall experience. But Bauman notes that a typical Blue Bottle customer wants a delightful but utilitarian experience. Proactively reaching out to customers is a further extension of the thoughtful care Blue Bottle has been known for. \u201cYou have two months to make sure you meet and exceed [the customer\u2019s] expectation,\u201d Bauman adds. \u201cThey want us to have sweat the details, to have crafted things in a way that creates a pleasant and fun experience but not for fun\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition also brews fresh opportunities for brick-and-mortar, with new caf\u00e9s opening next week in Los Angeles and New York City. Blue Bottle\u2019s first caf\u00e9 abroad is slated open in Japan during the first quarter of 2015. \u201c[Tokyo] is not a license. It\u2019s not a joint venture,\u201d Freeman emphasizes. \u201cIt\u2019s all our money and all our risk.\u201d Japan is also an ideal testing ground abroad, he notes. \u201cTokyo and Japan in general has most demanding consumer culture in the world. If we can please them, we\u2019ve proven something we can bring back to benefit the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect Blue Bottle to saturate urban neighborhoods the way Starbucks did\u2014at least, not yet. \u201cCafes are expensive. They take a long time to build. Even if we had all the money in the world, it would take a long time to build cafes,\u201d Freeman explains. By taking a two-pronged approach with new storefronts and a customizable subscription plan, Blue Bottle can quench consumers\u2019 thirst for both more shops and a better home brewing experience.\n\n\u201cSomeone is our customer, whether or not they\u2019re in a caf\u00e9 or having Blue Bottle at home,\u201d Freeman says.",

        "text": "Ana\u00efs Mitchell wanted to keep it simple. In four years, she has released a trio of thematically rich albums, which in their pure inventiveness and musical diversity form a stunning creative hot streak. She has done this with help from a growing cast of collaborators culled from the world of Americana and contemporary folk. But for her latest effort, she wanted to strip it right back to the source.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming of musical age, I was really into the coffeehouse scene and Dar Williams and Ani DiFranco, and all those characters were touring solo at the beginning and I would always be disappointed when they finally started having a budget to have drums and bass and stuff,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cAnd of course, as soon as I could afford a band, I had one, too. But I always wanted to just make a record of the songs as they were written.\u201d\n\nSo this month saw the low-key release of \u201cxoa,\u201d which plays as part autobiography and part love letter to Mitchell\u2019s fans. Featuring the artist on guitar and vocals, unaccompanied, it\u2019s composed of newly recorded versions of songs from throughout her career \u2014 notably, including some tunes whose lead vocals were sung by guest artists on the original versions \u2014 plus a few that haven\u2019t been heard before. Selections like \u201cOur Lady of the Underground,\u201d \u201cYoung Man in America,\u201d and \u201cYou Are Forgiven,\u201d heard in these unadorned renditions, should act as catnip to Mitchell\u2019s fans.\n\n\u201cIt really is more of a homespun effort,\u201d she says, \u201cfor people who are already familiar with the music.\u201d The sound isn\u2019t entirely dissimilar from her earliest work, but the record stands alone as a purely solo effort.\n\nAs the Vermont native speaks, she\u2019s in the cafe at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland. (Spotting Pete Seeger\u2019s banjo was a highlight, she says.) In the background of the phone call, her 1-year-old daughter contributes a few wordless comments to the conversation. Ramona\u2019s birth, her mom says, helped trigger Mitchell\u2019s current exercise in artistic introspection.\n\nIt\u2019s a long tour, and after her show at Club Passim in Cambridge on Monday, Mitchell will carry on with more than two-dozen dates in Europe. This is her first extended solo excursion after spending much of last year touring with New York-based musician Jefferson Hamer behind their album of reconfigured English and Scottish folk songs.\n\nBefore that, she had traveled with a band to focus on material from \u201cYoung Man in America,\u201d her darkly ruminative concept album inspired by her father and grandfather. And she\u2019s spent much of her time in the past eight years refining \u201cHadestown,\u201d her folk-operatic retelling of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, having released a staggeringly good all-star studio incarnation in 2010. (Mitchell was in residence at Dartmouth College this past August, further developing the show in tandem with New York Theatre Workshop.)\n\nMitchell\u2019s last two records were produced by Gary Paczosa, an in-demand, Nashville-based engineer and producer who has worked on a dozen albums with Alison Krauss, plus others by Dolly Parton, Chris Thile, and Gillian Welch.\n\nSeveral artists with whom he was working told him he needed to hear \u201cHadestown,\u201d Paczosa says. He put the CD on in his studio, planning to listen to one song and then rush out the door to another commitment. \u201cWe sat and listened to the entire record. We didn\u2019t move,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019m rarely that captivated.\u201d\n\nMitchell says she has no particular interest in writing concept albums \u2014 sometimes things just work out that way.\n\n\u201cI think it just happens that songs come in and they bring along a couple friends, or a couple of cousins,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they may all seem to be chipping away at the same block, but it just happens to be the stuff that's going through your heart and your head at that time.\u201d\n\nWith the most recent addition to the family, she and her husband moved back to Vermont from Brooklyn, where they had spent a few years. She has begun a graduate program in creative writing at Goddard College, pursued remotely through independent study. She\u2019s been listening to a lot of operas and musicals, and wants to sharpen her skills to write another staged production.\n\nShe says the new album and current tour are part of the process before \u201cmoving ahead into the new era.\u201d\n\nWhat does the new era have in store?\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s that I\u2019m rolling around in a van, and trying to do an MFA program, and trying to jog in the parking lot of the hotel with Ramona in a stroller,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to go to bed immediately after the gig, rather than having a bohemian evening afterwards.\u201d",

It believes its patent-pending SQL relational database technology\u2014built completely from scratch\u2014can accommodate more types of business data than legacy offerings from the likes of Teradata TDC or big data management platforms building on Hadoop. \u201cCustomers do have existing solutions, but they\u2019re not satisfied. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re entering a market where people are happy with their current solutions,\u201d Muglia says.\n\nRather than requiring customers to install its technology on site, Snowflake is offering it as a service. Businesses pay for how much data they are storing and by the number of hours it takes to analytics queries against their information. The most direct competitor is Redshift from Amazon Web Services . The company claims its approach costs 90% less than investing in the hardware and software necessary to build on on-site data warehouse.\n\nSnowflake was founded two years ago by a team of engineers who between them hold more than 120 patents in databases and data management technologies: Oracle ORCL veterans Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes, and Dutch computer scientist Marcin Zukowski. The whimsical name pays homage to their mutual love of snow sports. Muglia joined as CEO in June, taking over from Sutter Hill director Mike Speiser, who was managing the team while it was in stealth mode.\n\nMuglia admits Snowflake won\u2019t appeal to companies that aren\u2019t willing to put their data on cloud servers and storage. Its initial customers hail from the advertising, media, and technology sectors.\n\n\u201cWhoever has the biggest dataset can answer the hardest questions,\u201d says James Rooney, senior vice president of media platforms at Accordant Media, one of Snowflake\u2019s beta customers. \u201cInstead of spending an hour waiting for a response, we get it in five minutes with Snowflake. So we can spend more time interpreting the result or whiteboarding harder questions.\u201d\n\nWhether Snowflake can melt the hearts of skeptics remains to be seen.

The original article can be found here.\n\nTwo Palestinians stormed a Jerusalem synagogue on Tuesday, attacking worshippers praying inside with knives, axes and guns, and killing four people before they were killed in a shootout with police, officials said.\n\nThe attack, the deadliest in Jerusalem in years, is bound to ratchet up fears of sustained violence in the city, already on edge amid soaring tensions over a contested holy site.\n\nThree of the victims held dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship and the fourth man was a British-Israeli national, police said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Israel will \u201crespond harshly\u201d to the attack, describing it as a \u201ccruel murder of Jews who came to pray and were killed by despicable murderers.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke to Netanyahu after the assault and denounced it as an \u201cact of pure terror and senseless brutality and violence.\u201d\n\nIsraeli police called it a terrorist attack and said the two Palestinian assailants were cousins from east Jerusalem. It was not immediately known if they were affiliated with any group. Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack but stopped short of claiming responsibility.\n\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said six people were also wounded in the attack, including two police officers. Four of the wounded were reported in serious condition. He said police were searching the area for other suspects.\n\nAssociated Press footage from the scene showed the synagogue, in Jerusalem\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Har Nof neighborhood, surrounded by police and rescue workers following the attack.\n\nWounded worshippers were being assisted by paramedics and a bloodied butcher\u2019s knife lay near the scene of the attack.\n\n\u201cI tried to escape. The man with the knife approached me. There was a chair and table between us \u2026 my prayer shawl got caught. I left it there and escaped,\u201d Yossi, who was praying at the synagogue at the time of the attack, told Israeli Channel 2 TV. He declined to give his last name.\n\nA photo in Israeli media from inside the synagogue showed what appeared to be a body on the floor draped in a prayer shawl, with blood smattered nearby.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Luba Samri said the attackers were Palestinians from east Jerusalem, which has been the scene of relentless clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in recent months.\n\nJerusalem itself has seen a spate of attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. At least six people have been killed in the city, the West Bank and Tel Aviv in recent weeks, prior to Tuesday\u2019s casualties.\n\nJerusalem residents have already been fearful of what appeared to be lone wolf attacks using cars or knives against pedestrians. But Tuesday\u2019s synagogue attack harkens back to the gruesome attacks during the Palestinian uprising of the last decade.\n\nIsrael\u2019s police chief said Tuesday\u2019s attack was likely not organized by militant groups, similar to other recent incidents, making it more difficult for security forces to prevent the violence.\n\n\u201cThese are individuals that decide to do horrible acts. It\u2019s very hard to know ahead of time about every such incident,\u201d Yohanan Danino told reporters at the scene.\n\nTensions appeared to have been somewhat defused last week following a meeting between Netanyahu, Kerry and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II in Amman. The meeting was an attempt to restore calm after months of violent confrontations surrounding a sacred shrine holy to both Jews and Muslims.\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians said then they would take steps to reduce tensions that might lead to an escalation.\n\nIn his statement, Netanyahu blamed the violence on incitement by both Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and said the international community ignores the incitement.\n\nKerry blamed the attack on Palestinian calls for \u201cdays of rage,\u201d and said Palestinian leaders must take serious steps to refrain from such incitement. He also urged Palestinian leaders to condemn the attack \u201cin the most powerful terms.\u201d\n\nHamas\u2019 statement praised the synagogue attack, saying it was a \u201cresponse to continued Israeli crimes, the killing, desecrating al-Aqsa (mosque),\u201d a reference to a recent incident at the holy site.\n\nMuch of the recent violence stems from tensions surrounding the Jerusalem holy site referred to by Jews as the Temple Mount because of the Jewish temples that stood there in biblical times. It is the most sacred place in Judaism; Muslims refer to it as the Noble Sanctuary, and it is their third holiest site, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe site is so holy that Jews have traditionally refrained from going there, instead praying at the adjacent Western Wall. Israel\u2019s chief rabbis have urged people not to ascend to the area, but in recent years, a small but growing number of Jews, including ultranationalist lawmakers, have begun regularly visiting the site.",

Siluanov has already warned that the big increase in defense spending earmarked for the next three years is unaffordable.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the consequences of geopolitics, they are, of course, substantial,\u201d Siluanov said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as critical for the exchange rate and even for the budget as the oil price.\u201d\n\nSiluanov\u2019s comments come on the eve of a crucial meeting of oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, which will focus on the alarming slide in oil prices since the summer. In a weekend interview with ITAR-TASS, Putin insinuated that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had conspired to drive up global supply well beyond actual levels of demand, in order to weaken the Russian economy. Somewhat confusingly, he later added that \u201cmaybe the Saudis want to \u2018kill off\u2019 their competitors\u201d in the U.S. shale oil sector.\u201d\n\nRussia isn\u2019t a member of OPEC, but depends on taxes from oil and gas companies for some two-thirds of its budget revenue. A draft for next year\u2019s budget, approved in September, assumes an average oil price of $100 a barrel, while banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase & Co. think it will be nearer $80.\n\nBarred from western financial markets, the government will either have to cut spending or raise taxes to keep the deficit down to its projected 0.6% of gross domestic product, or borrow at increasingly expensive rates from domestic savers and institutions. The yield on the government\u2019s 10-year bonds has risen to 10.12% as of Monday from 7.71% at the start of the year, as the ruble has depreciated by 30% against the dollar.\n\nRussia\u2019s central bank earlier this month cut its forecast for growth next year to zero, after having to raise interest rates sharply to stop the ruble\u2019s fall. GDP rose by only 0.8% on the year in the third quarter, although that was above economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe ruble has rebounded sharply against the dollar in recent days as the central bank\u2019s actions have started to gain traction and stem a wave of speculation. By mid-day in Moscow, the ruble was at its highest in more than two weeks against the dollar as oil and gas companies converted their export earnings back into rubles ahead of a routine tax payment deadline.",

Miller, TIME\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced a proposal Thursday to provide two years of free community-college tuition to American students who maintain good grades.\n\n\u201cPut simply, what I\u2019d like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everyone who\u2019s willing to work for it,\u201d Obama said in a video filmed Wednesday aboard Air Force One and posted to Facebook.

And like Amazon, sales have grown rapidly \u2014 while its profit shrinks.\n\nThe upscale department store\u2019s overall revenue rose 9.8% to $3.12 billion for the quarter ending May 2. Comparable sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores, rose 4.4% from the year-ago period, the strongest among the company\u2019s peers.\n\nYet Nordstrom\u2019s profit fell to $128 million from $140 million while its return on invested capital fell just over one percentage point to 12.2%.\n\nNordstrom has been pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into building up its digital sales, expanding into Canada and planning a beachhead in Manhattan. It\u2019s doubling the size of its Rack outlet chain and acquired e-commerce sites like Trunk Club, as it looks to keep up with shoppers\u2019 quickly changing behavior and avoid the doldrums afflicting many brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\n\u201cOur customer strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the high level of service they expect from us,\u201d Blake Nordstrom, one of three siblings who are presidents at the retailer and scion of the company\u2019s founding family, said on a conference call with investors.\n\nIt seems to be working with Nordstrom now getting 20% of sales from e-commerce. That\u2019s well ahead of the 12% share of e-commerce at Macy\u2019s M and comparable to Neiman Marcus, which has a natural advantage thanks to its legacy catalog business. Two years ago, Nordstrom only got 13% of sales online.\n\nNordstrom\u2019s goal is to hit $20 billion in overall sales \u2014 bricks and mortar plus online \u2014 by 2020, 50% more than 2014 levels. To get there, the department store plans to spend $4.3 billion between now and 2019, or about 5% of sales.\n\nThe biggest chunk of that, $1.5 billion will be dedicated to technology and warehouses to speed up the delivery of online orders to better compete with Amazon, among others. For example, it is opening a new fulfillment center in Pennsylvania so that online orders can reach the East Coast more quickly.\n\nNordstrom is also spending big on things like updating its mobile shopping app and upgrading tools to better target customers with discount offers. It has added location-based features to it app and recently integrated its loyalty rewards program to make it easier for customers to redeem awards from mobile devices.\n\nWhile Nordstrom\u2019s full-service upscale department store will remain the centerpiece of the company\u2019s business (by 2020, it would still represent 58% of sales, the company told Wall Street analysts on Thursday), it is clear growth will have to come from elsewhere. Its traditional department stores had comparable sales growth of a mere 0.5% in the first quarter. In contrast, Nordstrom.com sales rose 20%.\n\nOn the discount store front, online sales at Nordstrom Rack and Nordstrom\u2019s flash sales site HauteLook.com, rose 51% to $117 million even as comparable sales at physical Rack stores slipped a bit. Nordstromrack.com launched only a year ago and the company has had to spend money to expand the assortment available on the site.\n\nAs for international expansion, Nordstrom recently opened its second Canadian store, in Ottawa. Long term, the retailer is planning six stores in Canada and thinks that market can eventually be a $1 billion business. It is also working on its first Manhattan department store, set to open in three years.\n\nWall Street has occasionally dinged Nordstrom for its big spending on new initiatives. But Thursday, after the earnings report, the company\u2019s shares JWN rose despite the profit dip because management showed that the investments are paying off.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story at Amazon, although it has taken big spending to a new level by tolerating quarterly losses. That company has been building up its cloud computing business, adding perks to its Prime subscription shipping plan, opening warehouses, and testing online grocery delivery. The result has been an industry leader with sales that rose 15% last quarter, and a loss that investors sometimes grumble about but forgive AMZN .\n\nThere must be something in the water in Seattle.\n\nFor more about Amazon, watch this Fortune video:",

        "text": "Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, who has died aged 78, was Australia's most distinguished potter. Because she had learned much of her craft in England, training with some of its best-known figures, and had set up her first studio in London, she achieved honorary status as an important British artist as well. The association with Britain has been rekindled in a memorable series of exhibitions in the UK over the past 20 years, and it was while visiting London for the latest of these that she suffered a stroke.\n\nHanssen Pigott created a new language for ceramics through her famous still-life groupings of pots, some extended into larger assemblies of pieces: bowls, bottles, beakers, jugs and cups displayed in carefully orchestrated arrangements. They were sculptural artworks, but used the most basic language of pottery forms, of everyday objects. Her roots as a functional maker were always clear, and owed much to her first teacher, the pioneering potter Ivan McMeekin, and her early admiration for Song dynasty Chinese pottery.\n\nBorn Gwyn John in Ballarat, Victoria, she discovered the beauties of oriental pots at the National Gallery of Victoria while a fine art student at Melbourne University. She was greatly influenced by Bernard Leach's A Potter's Book. Hearing about McMeekin, she succeeded in becoming apprenticed to him at his Mittagong studio in New South Wales. She was immersed in a creative philosophy that embraced the processing of raw materials, the rhythms of throwing on the wheel, and wood firing, all aspects that she carried with her in what she described as \"a very graceful potting life\".\n\nIn 1958, keen to build on this knowledge, she travelled to Britain to work with a succession of noted potters including Leach, Michael Cardew and Ray Finch. It was while she was with Finch at his Winchcombe workshop that she cycled 25 miles to my father Geoffrey Whiting's pottery in Worcestershire, arriving late in the evening and unannounced. Her energies were clearly devoted to her new passion, and to a studio movement only just burgeoning. In 1960 she and her husband, Louis Hanssen, set up a workshop in a basement in Notting Hill, London, where she produced well crafted tablewares for outlets including Heal's and Primavera, and she made useful contact with the potter Lucie Rie, which helped to inject a crisp modernity into her work.\n\nIn 1966, after the end of her marriage, Hanssen Pigott established a pottery at Ach\u00e8res, in the Loire valley, where she made handsome domestic ware in rich, muted glazes, as well as elegant, thinly potted porcelain and stoneware pieces that were premonitory of her later work. In 1973, she returned to Australia and subsequently created a studio in Tasmania with her second husband, John Pigott. She experimented further with wood firing, enjoying the varied surface effects of pots brushed by kiln flame. In a few years she was concentrating on porcelain alone, working with the chromatic combination of cool celadons and warmer orange and ochre surfaces.\n\nBy the late 80s, during which time she had residencies in Adelaide and Brisbane, the forms were stripped down to essentials, and the pots soon arranged in spatially nuanced configurations. Her admiration for the painter Giorgio Morandi was a particular catalyst. Hanssen Pigott loved the intensity of Morandi's gaze, his ability to make commonplace utility objects into something poetic. She enjoyed his focus on negative space, the pauses and intervals in his carefully staged groups. Hanssen Pigott translated such ideas into the studied poise of her increasingly ambitious, often lengthy, clusters of pots \u2013 pieces that were refined, quiet and superbly finished, and that intelligently explored relationships of shape, colour and tone. The effect was painterly as well as sculptural.\n\nBy the time she had moved in 1989 to Netherdale, in the sugar cane country of Queensland, her international reputation was being consolidated by extensive travelling and teaching, and by solo shows in countries including Britain, Australia, the US, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and Italy.\n\nIn London she was given beautifully presented exhibitions at Galerie Besson, Tate St Ives, and finally at Erskine, Hall & Coe. In 2002, shortly after moving to her last studio, at Ipswich in Queensland, she was awarded the medal of the Order of Australia; this was followed by a rare retrospective at the National Gallery of Victoria where, 50 years earlier, she had first fallen in love with ceramics.\n\nShe was energetic and lively in personality and prodigiously gifted, technically and intellectually; no one was more engaged with the language of clay or the wider visual world. As she said of the luminous translucency of her mature work: \"The way the pots transform in light is something special to me because this reflects what we are as human beings, ordinary but with the possibility of joy.\"\n\n\u2022 Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, potter, born 1 January 1935; died 5 July 2013",

        "text": "By Russell L. Parr and George Hovanec , guest contributors\n\nA January decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had a sweeping effect: it dropped the value of US patents. Just how much the value has been reduced, overall, is not yet known. Part of the reason we don\u2019t know is because the reduction in value is not going to be equally distributed across every patent. Rather, we know that patents owned by individual inventors, universities and research institutes will be hardest hit. Here, we\u2019ll explain what happened, and why it matters.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s what happened last month. A frequently used method in determining damages for patent infringement, \u201cthe 25% Rule of Thumb,\u201d was rejected by the Court in Uniloc USA, Inc. et al. v. Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft was found to infringe Uniloc\u2019s patent for a piece of technology. Expert testimony at trial concerning patent damages had, like many cases through history, relied on the 25% Rule of Thumb to determine damages owed to Uniloc.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT appealed the decision reached by the jury and the Court rejected the use of the 25% Rule of Thumb. Not just for this particular case \u2014 but for forever \u2014 even though it has been used in and out of court to determine royalty rates for decades.\n\nThe 25% rule isn\u2019t just for court cases, however. Patent owners often license the rights to use a patented invention in exchange for royalties. The royalty is usually a percentage rate (royalty rate) applied to the sales earned by using the patent. The \u201c25% Rule\u201d is a typical starting rate that suggests that 25% of the profits earned from using the invention goes to the patent owner while the remaining 75% stays with the licensee. The thinking here is that the licensee has brought other assets to the commercialization of the patented invention. These can include manufacturing expertise, well established brand names and a distribution network. By retaining 75% of the profits, the licensee is allowed to earn a return on its significant contribution.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all bad though: blind application of the 25% Rule can and does lead to errors. Many other factors must be considered \u2014 and usually are thoroughly considered \u2014 by most experts. But the rule can be a shortcut in both the good and bad sense of the word.\n\nWhen the licensed invention is central to the success of a product then the rule is a good starting point, such as when the patented invention is the active ingredient in a cancer therapy. But for example, if a design alternative can be inexpensively substituted without infringing the patent, an entirely different analysis is needed. When 25% Rule has been improperly applied, extraordinary damage awards for seemingly minor improvements to a product have been made. It seems the Court has become frustrated by these abuses of the 25% Rule and used the Microsoft/Uniloc case to react.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get complicated, and patent values can potentially go down: Companies whose patents are infringed can often find other ways to calculate damages especially against competitors who unfairly used their patents. But individual inventors, universities and research institutes typically cannot commercialize their inventions, and need to recover damages after the infringement has occurred. Without being able to rely on the 25% Rule, inventors, universities and research institutes have lost an important arrow in their quiver.\n\nBy making the determination of a royalty rate more difficult, it also becomes more difficult and expensive to protect patents from being infringed upon. And that could encourage more infringement to happen. All in all, it just became a lot harder for researchers and inventors to protect themselves in patent fights, especially if big corporations are the ones on the other side of the battle.\n\n\u2014 Russell L. Parr is President of Intellectual Property Research Associates. George Hovanec is a shareholder in the Intellectual Property Section of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, PC.",

Take into account the financial challenges millennials face and it's easy to understand why so many feel like they aren't making enough, say experts.\n\n\"Millennials have an uphill climb,\" said Anthony P. Carnevale, a professor and director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. \"The economy has increased the demand for skills and millennials are the first generation that has had to deal with that.\"\n\nThe cost of getting a job is leaving millennials in the red. Educational requirements for many jobs have increased, and so has college tuition.\n\nThe average cost of attending undergraduate classes at a four-year private university is now nearly $42,500 per year\u2014triple the price tag in 1990. Even state schools now cost students nearly $19,000 per year on average, a more than 100 percent increase over the last 25 years.\n\nRead MoreIs a college degree overvalued?\n\n\"There's no doubt that more [millennials] are likely to graduate with student debt and the amounts that they owe are greater\" than other generations, said senior researcher Richard Fry of the Pew Research Center. On average, student borrowers who graduated this year will owe $35,051, according to Mark Kantrowitz, a student financial aid policy expert and publisher of Edvisors.com\u2014a record high.\n\nA lot of millennials also graduated into or after the Great Recession, which was deeper and longer than the recession Gen Xers faced in the 1990s.\n\nThe 1990-91 recession in America lasted eight months and saw unemployment rise to 7.8 percent. But unemployment reached as high as 10 percent in 2009, just after the Great Recession officially ended. (That downturn officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.)\n\nWhile earnings of full-time workers are up slightly compared to the 1990s, \"On every other indicator\u2013unemployment rate, landing full-time jobs, average hours worked, etc.\u2013there's no doubt that millennials four years into the recovery were worse off than any other generation,\" said Fry.\n\nBased on his studies, Carnevale estimates about 23 percent of millennials are underemployed but projects that will drop down to about 17 percent in the next few years as the economy continues to improve. Still, he adds: \"The Great Recession will mark the millennials for the rest of their lives. It affects your earnings trajectory for the rest of your life.\"\n\nThere is one silver lining for millennials though: baby boomers. Over the next decade, economists estimate about 30 million job openings will arise from baby boomers retiring. That's good news not just for the underemployed or out-of-work millennials, but for the millions of younger millennials who will soon be entering the workforce.",

The world must unite behind a holistic drive to discredit the ideology that gives extremists their power, and to restore hope and dignity to those whom they would recruit.\n\nRead MoreCost of US campaign against ISIS is roughly $1 billion\n\nISIS certainly can \u2013 and will \u2013 be defeated militarily by the international coalition that is now assembling and which the UAE is actively supporting. But military containment is only a partial solution. Lasting peace requires three other ingredients: winning the battle of ideas; upgrading weak governance; and supporting grassroots human development.\n\nSuch a solution must begin with concerted international political will. Not a single politician in North America, Europe, Africa, or Asia can afford to ignore events in the Middle East. A globalized threat requires a globalized response. Everyone will feel the heat, because such flames know no borders; indeed, ISIS has recruited members of at least 80 nationalities.\n\nISIS is a barbaric and brutal organization. It represents neither Islam nor humanity's most basic values. Nonetheless, it has emerged, spread, and resisted those who oppose it. What we are fighting is not just a terrorist organization, but the embodiment of a malicious ideology that must be defeated intellectually.\n\nI consider this ideology to be the greatest danger that the world will face in the next decade. Its seeds are growing in Europe, the United States, Asia, and elsewhere. With its twisted religious overtones, this pre-packaged franchise of hate is available for any terrorist group to adopt. It carries the power to mobilize thousands of desperate, vindictive, or angry young people and use them to strike at the foundations of civilization.\n\nRead MoreAlbright looks to Turkey for help in war against ISIS\n\nThe ideology fueling ISIS has much in common with that of Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. What most worries me is that a decade ago, such an ideology was all that Al Qaeda needed to destabilize the world, even from a primitive base in the caves of Afghanistan. Today, under ISIS, adherents have access to technology, finance, a huge land base, and an international jihadist network. Far from being defeated, their ideology of rage and hate has become stricter, more pernicious, and more widespread.\n\nThe destruction of terrorist groups is not enough to bring lasting peace. We must also strike at the root to deprive their dangerous ideology of the power to rise again among people left vulnerable by an environment of hopelessness and desperation. And, on this note, let us be positive.\n\nThe solution has three components. The first is to counter malignant ideas with enlightened thinking, open minds, and an attitude of tolerance and acceptance. This approach arises from our Islamic religion, which calls for peace, honors life, values dignity, promotes human development, and directs us to do good to others.\n\nOnly one thing can stop a suicidal youth who is ready to die for ISIS: a stronger ideology that guides him onto the right path and convinces him that God created us to improve our world, not to destroy it. We can look to our neighbors in Saudi Arabia for their great successes in de-radicalizing many young people through counseling centers and programs. In this battle of minds, it is thinkers and scientists of spiritual and intellectual stature among Muslims who are best placed to lead the charge.\n\nRead MoreISIS airstrikes: Who are the US's Arab allies?\n\nThe second component is support for governments' efforts to create stable institutions that can deliver real services to their people. It should be clear to everyone that the rapid growth of ISIS was fueled by the Syrian and Iraqi governments' failings: the former made war on its own people, and the latter promoted sectarian division. When governments fail to address instability, legitimate grievances, and persistent serious challenges, they create an ideal environment for hateful ideologies to incubate \u2013 and for terrorist organizations to fill the vacuum of legitimacy.\n\nThe final component is to address urgently the black holes in human development that afflict many areas of the Middle East. This is not only an Arab responsibility, but also an international responsibility, because providing grassroots opportunity and a better quality of life for the people of this region is guaranteed to ameliorate our shared problems of instability and conflict. We have a critical need for long-term projects and initiatives to eliminate poverty, improve education and health, build infrastructure, and create economic opportunities. Sustainable development is the most sustainable answer to terrorism.\n\nOur region is home to more than 200 million young people. We have the opportunity to inspire them with hope and to direct their energies toward improving their lives and the lives of those around them. If we fail, we will abandon them to emptiness, unemployment, and the malicious ideologies of terrorism.\n\nEvery day that we take a step toward delivering economic development, creating jobs, and raising standards of living, we undermine the ideologies of fear and hate that feed on hopelessness. We starve terrorist organizations of their reason to exist.\n\nI am optimistic, because I know that the people of the Middle East possess a power of hope and a desire for stability and prosperity that are stronger and more enduring than opportunistic and destructive ideas. There is no power stronger than that of hope for a better life.\n\nCommentary by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai.

If not, we can just be friends,' \" Palm tells PEOPLE of one of his first dates with Kirsten. \"And she signed on with a smile on her face.\"\n\nBorn in Illinois and raised primarily in Southern California, Palm, now 41, was the son of a minister and grew up with a love for aviation and a desire to help people.\n\nAt age 16, Palm says he had a \"life-changing\" experience that inspired him to find a way to combine his two passions.\n\n\"I got the chance to go to Mexico with my church's youth group to build houses for people who were less fortunate,\" he says. \"Being a part of that felt like a godsend. It was confirmation that I needed to use my passion for aviation to serve in a remote area of the world.\"\n\nThree years later, while in college, Palm and a friend took a trip to Papua New Guinea in the southwest Pacific Ocean. They spent five weeks visiting remote islands and living with the tribes.\n\n\"These people were living without the basics,\" Palm says of his 1994 trip. \"They brought us this little boy who had a small cut on his leg that was badly infected. It was something so simple that here in the States we would put a little bit of ointment on and it would be over. But this little boy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that. We used a first aid kit and we tired to fix him up the best we could, but we realized this is a place that needed help.\"\n\n, a medial outreach program that now serves the 500,000 residents of Papua New Guinea's East Sepik Province.\n\nMark Palm in Papau New Guinea.\n\n\"Eighty percent of these people live in remote areas and would have to travel two to five days to reach the one hospital in the province,\" says Palm. \"But [in 2010,] we started operating the area's only seaplane. We deliver medicine and supplies and provide transportation to people in emergency situations.\"\n\nPalm estimates that Samaritan Aviation \u2013 which is funded by donations as well as the government of Papua New Guinea \u2013 has helped save almost 400 lives, many of them mothers and babies.\n\n\"One time we got called to pick up a woman who had passed out during a breech birth. We got a local nurse and flew to pick the mom up, but there wasn't room for her husband to come along with us. He had to take the long way,\" says Palm. \"It took him a few days to reach the town where the hospital is and when he did he went to the morgue assuming that's where he'd find both his baby and his wife but they weren't there.\"\n\n\"They sent him to the hospital where he found his wife and twin babies,\" Palm continues. \"I remember him looking at my wife and basically saying, 'I don't deserve this. I'm a bad person and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve you guys coming over here to save my wife.' That was a picture of grace for us. That is why we do what we do.\"\n\nPalm has dedicated his life to Samaritan Aviation but is quick to acknowledge that he does not do it alone. He spent the first part of last year training a second pilot and has hired a medical director. A second seaplane will be in operation beginning in early 2016 with another pilot moving out soon to help with the workload.\n\n\"That plane is invaluable,\" says Andrew Rankin, a former Sepik program manager with Oxfam in Papua New Guinea, an organization that has helped fund Samaritan Aviation's work. \"Without Mark and his operation, it would be impossible to service the villages in that area. It literally is a life-and-death situation that they are saving people from.\"\n\nKirsten Palm in Papau New Guinea.\n\nPalm is grateful for the support of his board, donors, mentors and fellow pilots, but he is perhaps most thankful that his wife and three kids \u2013 Sierra, 13, Drake, 11, and Nolan, 10 \u2013 have been with him the entire time.\n\n\"I couldn't do this without my wife. She will drive the ambulance from the plane to the hospital and she stays with the patients. She helps feed them and prays with them,\" says Palm. \"And my kids are right there too. They see the needs and they've had the chance to respond to those needs at a young age. I think it's important that they see that things are bigger than themselves. I think that is shaping who they are as people.\"\n\nPalm would love for Samaritan Aviation to expand across the globe, but for now, he's focused on helping the people of the East Sepik Province.\n\n\"The need is so great for right now in Papua New Guinea. If we find other opportunities, we'll look at those. But the priority is helping here before we worry about anywhere else,\" he says. \"It's all about looking outward and saying, 'What are the needs around us and how can we make a difference?' \"",

Saxony criminal police chief Joerg Michaelis says that the three Syrians who captured him recognised the suspect from wanted posters police posted online as part of the manhunt.\n\nAfter taking him to their apartment late Sunday night, two of the Syrians bound and held Albakr while the third brought a photo of Albakr to a local police station, leading to the arrest early Monday, Michaelis said.\n\nProsecutors and police said on Monday they considered Albakr an extremist with likely links to the Islamic State group. Germany's domestic intelligence agency had been watching him since September and alerted Saxony authorities about his alleged possible plot on Friday, authorities said.\n\nWhen police raided the apartment in the city of Chemnitz where he was thought to be staying on Saturday, Albakr was able to flee. Inside the apartment they found 1.5kgs \"extremely dangerous explosives'' and components, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nMichaelis said at this stage of the investigation \"the behaviour and actions of the suspect currently speak for an IS context.'' He didn't elaborate.\n\nA security official said there was no indication yet that Albakr was being directed by the Islamic State group, but investigators are still checking evidence.\n\nPolice said it was not clear when and how the suspect met up with his three countrymen in Leipzig, about 80kms from Chemnitz, or if they already knew him.\n\nThey would not release any further information about the three Syrians who apprehended Albakr. If the signs of his having an extremist background were substantiated, \"the people who gave the tip are of course in danger,'' the police chief said.\n\nGerman prosecutors say they they had no indications that an attack target had been chosen.\n\nBut Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the domestic intelligence agency, later told ARD public broadcaster their investigations suggest the suspect had \"an eye on the Berlin airports'' as potential targets.",

        "text": "Master of contrast ... Ib Geertsen. Photograph: Rocket Gallery\n\nThe Danish modernist artist Ib Geertsen, who has died aged 90, was one of the originators of the \"Konkret\" movement in postwar Scandinavia. Derived from constructivism, the movement was closely associated with Denmark's social democracy and with major state-sponsored public art commissions. Geertsen, a progressive and a populist, became a committed proponent of the Konkret aesthetic and the universalism with which it was associated.\n\nBorn in Copenhagen, Geertsen grew up in the second city of Aarhus, where he trained as a gardener. His non-academic background and diverse early career reflected one important strand of the Danish modern movement, which was as equally rooted in provincial arts and crafts traditions as it was in the intellectual and bohemian life of the capital.\n\nAs a teenager, Geertsen became interested in the work of the Greenland artist Karale Andreassen, whose output was in the Nordic modern romantic manner. He also sought to emulate C\u00e9zanne's flat compositional structure in his portraits and still life paintings of the late 1930s. Indeed structure and form rather than subject or motif increasingly became Geertsen's central preoccupations.By the early 1940s, by which time Denmark was under German occupation, Geertsen had become increasingly involved in the Danish avant garde, perhaps as a form of resistance to the kitsch academic styles of Nazi art. His growing circle of artist friends were all politically left-leaning and, to varying degrees, involved in the resistance movement. In 1941, he helped the art dealer Thorkild Hansen to arrange a small exhibition of abstract art by Asger Jorn, Egill Jacobsen, Richard Mortensen and others in Aarhus. By 1943, Geertsen's work had also been exhibited by Hansen at his gallery in Copenhagen. As a result, Geertsen moved there and his work quickly developed a vigorous expressionist manner, also favoured at that time by Mortensen, his close friend and mentor.\n\nAlong with his fellow artists Albert Mertz and Richard Winther, Geertsen co-founded the multi-disciplinary neo-Dada Linien II group in 1947. Their first exhibition that year not only featured paintings and sculptures, but also performances and concerts. Thereafter, Geertsen's work became increasingly disciplined and was characterised by bold, flat forms and clearly delineated blocks of bright, contrasting colour.\n\nNew members of Linien II, such as Gunnar Aagaard Andersen and the French constructivist Jean Dewasne, probably influenced Geertsen's shift from expressionism to constructivism. More generally, after Denmark's liberation, the country was swept by a wave of Americanism that affected Danish art, design and architecture on many levels. Thus, notwithstanding Geertsen's claim to work instinctively, his more theoretically minded colleagues were undoubtedly aware of the New York art critic Clement Greenberg's writings on \"medium-specific purity,\" which influenced the international development of constructivist art in the west from the late 1940s onwards.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Geertsen had developed a simplified formal language to use throughout his work, the \"tear drop\" or \"circle-square\" (a circular motif with one corner squared off) becoming a recurring motif, which he intended the public to recognise as his signature. This development coincided with the growth of Denmark's welfare state and with the widespread commissioning of substantial modernist artworks by the government and municipal authorities to adorn nearly all new public buildings and transport infrastructure. As a result, Geertsen's vivid colours and dynamic forms brightened up hospitals, road underpasses, schools and universities.\n\nAt the same time, Geertsen began to produce painted steel sculptures and mobiles which shared the playful abstract language of his paintings and screen prints. His cast-concrete sculptures for children's play areas contained tunnels through which to crawl. He hoped that his work would bring spiritual uplift to passers-by, who would enjoy its formal and aesthetic qualities; there was no mysterious message and what you saw was what you saw.\n\nA charming and intelligent man, Geertsen nonetheless studiously avoided being doctrinaire and sought to engage with as wide an audience as possible, in line with his centre-left political outlook. He planned his canvases by cutting out the various shapes in paper and adjusting them until he achieved the desired arrangement. Then, he drew round the shapes and blocked in the colours without using masking.\n\nGeertsen was married three times. With his third wife, Birthe S\u00f8derberg, whom he married in 1960, he had a daughter, Anne Marete, born in 1964; her death in 2006 came as a great personal blow to Geertsen. Thereafter, he gave up painting and concentrated only on making mobiles and sculptures.\n\nGeertsen remained little known outside Denmark until late in his long career. In February 2009, an exhibition of his work was held for the first time in London, at the Rocket Gallery in Shoreditch, where he showed significant pieces in a variety of media spanning the past half-century. By this point, his health was in decline - yet he attended the opening, charming everybody present.\n\nMeanwhile, a major summer retrospective exhibition, concentrating on Geertsen's sculptures and mobiles, was being planned at the ARoS art museum in Aarhus. On the eve of the private view, he died.\n\nHe is survived by Birthe and by his grandson and granddaughter.\n\n\u2022 Ib Geertsen, artist, born 7 January 1919; died 3 June 2009",

        "text": "With the death of the artist Frederick Gore, aged 95, a link has been lost with the Camden Town school of painting. Gore never knew his father, the painter Spencer Gore, a leading member of the group, who died in 1914 only a few months after Frederick's birth in Richmond, Surrey, but he revered his memory and for many years was a guardian of his reputation. Fred Gore, sometimes patrician and slightly raffish, with a love of street scenes and popular entertainments, was himself rather like a Camden Town artist. Some people think that his style became more akin to his father's as he grew older.\n\nAt Lancing college, West Sussex, Gore was head boy and an athlete, performing well in the public school championships held at the old Stamford Bridge track in south-west London. Corinthianism \u2013 doing better than professionals in a determinedly amateur fashion \u2013 was always a part of his character, sometimes to the bemusement of art school colleagues. At Trinity College, Oxford, which he entered in 1932, officially to read classics, he continued his athletic career. \"I had a scholarship. I did not do any work at Oxford. I drank a good deal and found a rather inappropriate lady of the town, whom I fell for.\"\n\nWhen not otherwise having a good time at Oxford, Gore studied at the Ruskin school of art. Its master was Albert Rutherston, his father's best friend, who led Gore towards art as a career. He eased him out of Oxford and into the Westminster art school in London, and then the Slade. Gore was one of those artists who was so willing a student that he accepted influence from a variety of sources. Camden Town painters, especially Walter Sickert, he could scarcely avoid. His earliest paintings were also influenced by Barnett Freedman, Mark Gertler, Bernard Meninsky and Cedric Morris.\n\nGore had his first show at the Redfern gallery in 1937. He then painted in Greece and exhibited the results in Paris, with a catalogue introduction written by Louis Vauxcelles, the veteran art critic who had coined the expression \"Fauves\". From 1940 to 1946 he served in the army, then returned to Greece and France. He then produced mural-like canvases of dancing peasants and a number of solitary, almost experimental landscapes. A plein-air artist by nature, Gore liked to carry his easel and painting materials to remote mountain sites in the south of France. When he found a place in which he sensed both solitude and danger, he knew he had found his subject.\n\nGore was head of the painting department at St Martin's school of art from 1951 until 1979, during which time he expanded facilities, conducted memorable battles with the renowned sculpture department and employed a succession of unconventional tutors, chief among them Gillian Ayres and Henry Mundy. In fact, his career at St Martin's coincided with the anarchic golden age of British art schools. He encouraged or tolerated eccentricity and believed that \"the pedantic side of art schools is an appalling thing\".\n\nIn almost the next breath, however, Gore could denounce Picasso (in his distinctly upper-class voice) as \"that dreadful fellow who has ruined all our lives\". It was often difficult to know where his allegiances lay. Some of his paintings, especially the landscapes, look like the work of a reborn post-impressionist. Many other canvases depict rock stars such as Ian Dury, whom Gore much admired, or Times Square in New York (painted from a hotel window), and these pictures often have the look of naive or amateur art.\n\nAt one time he was much excited by Jackson Pollock, who \"liberated me from concern with what kind of painting I did\". Gore never imitated Pollock. He simply realised that, like Pollock, he could do as he wished. Although he was not an abstract painter, Gore was a champion of abstraction at a time when, in Britain, non-referential painting was regarded with suspicion. His short but telling book, Abstract Art, published in 1956, praises a number of contemporary London painters for their abstract work and contains a generous description of Pollock's \"action painting\".\n\nGore thought of himself as a competent amateur theologian (his great-uncle was Bishop Charles Gore), and as a scholar. Another short book, Piero della Francesca's The Baptism, appeared in 1969. Gore wrote it to confront Kenneth Clark, who had unwisely attempted to snub him in a meeting and who (Gore believed, perhaps rightly) regarded the early renaissance master as his own intellectual property.\n\nHis ability to speak on equal terms with both establishment grandees and difficult artists made Gore a perfect helmsman of the Royal Academy as it came to terms with the new conditions of the 1980s and 90s. He was the most influential academician never to have been made president, a post he did not seek. He became an associate member in 1964, a full member in 1973, and was chairman of the academy's exhibition committee from 1976 to 1987.\n\nGore organised the academy's jubilee exhibition, British Painting 1952-77. Its selection appears much less peculiar today than it did at the time. Many of the avant-garde and eccentric artists represented soon became academicians, some of them reasoning that an institution with Freddie Gore as its guide might be worth joining.\n\nHe was not only a man who chaired committees. He had many unusual friends, a mysterious connection with the Hell's Angels (\"a rather elderly chapel, I'm afraid\") and until very late in life was a star at any party. This was because of his devotion to Russian folk dancing. Sometimes wearing a top hat, Fred in action was an amazing sight. He said that dancing was as much in his blood as was painting.\n\nHis mother had been a dancer, and in his youth he had frequented the Bal N\u00e8gre nightclub in Paris. His wife Connie had introduced him to flamenco dancing via a Gypsy friend. For technical reasons, which included great leaps and stamps, Russian dancing suited him best. Gore was a prominent member of the Balalaika dance group for more than 30 years. His friends often listened to his explanations of the balalaika (\"a crude gourd, don't you see, made triangular, with three strings of which two have the same percussive element\"). These lessons were often as baffling as his attitudes to art.\n\nHe is survived by Connie and his son and two daughters.\n\n\u2022 Frederick John Pym Gore, painter, born 8 November 1913; died 31 August 2009",

        "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is poised to vote on the most controversial Internet policy proposal in years, after opponents of the plan \u2014 from both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 launched a furious last-minute lobbying campaign to influence the outcome.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote on FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler\u2019s new Open Internet proposal has become a flash point in the intensifying public debate about \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the principle that broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon should treat all Internet traffic equally.\n\nWheeler, a former venture capitalist who\u2019s only been on the job for six months, finds himself squeezed in a vice-like grip between net neutrality advocates and public interest groups, who argue his rules don\u2019t go far enough, and industry giants and their allies on Capitol Hill, who oppose net neutrality regulations altogether.\n\nBoth sides warn that the very future of the Internet \u2014 which has spawned a generation of technological innovation and billions of dollars in economic growth \u2014 hangs in the balance. The fundamental question is whether broadband regulation should move in a direction that treats Internet service more like a utility and less like a premium service.\n\nNet neutrality advocates have been camping out for days in front of the FCC\u2019s office, which has struggled to maintain open phone lines under a torrent of calls. Wheeler, an avowed supporter of Open Internet principles, came out to chat with the protestors on Wednesday morning, and was even photographed wielding a \u201cHonk for the Open Internet\u201d sign.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote wouldn\u2019t enshrine the new rules, it would only approve what\u2019s called a \u201cnotice of proposed rulemaking\u201d (NPRM) making the draft proposal available for public review, and trigger several months of public comment. Wheeler hopes to have the new rules in place by the end of the year. The FCC\u2019s meeting starts at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nNet neutrality advocates want Wheeler and his colleagues to reclassify broadband companies under Title II \u201ccommon carrier\u201d provisions of the Communications Act that have governed traditional phone companies for decades. Such rules would subject the broadband companies to tighter regulation.\n\n\u201cWe urge the FCC to use its clear authority under Title II of the Communications Act to reclassify the transmission component of broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service,\u201d thirty-six U.S. lawmakers wrote in a letter to the FCC on Wednesday. \u201cRecognizing our nation\u2019s communications providers as common carriers under the law is common sense.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest broadband companies strenuously oppose such reclassification, arguing that it would \u201cthreaten new investment in broadband infrastructure and jeopardize the spread of broadband technology across America, holding back Internet speeds and ultimately deepening the digital divide.\u201d\n\n\u201cReclassification of broadband Internet access offerings as Title II \u2014 telecommunications services would impose great costs, allowing unprecedented government micromanagement of all aspects of the Internet economy,\u201d twenty-eight CEOs including Lowell McAdam of Verizon, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Robert Marcus of Time Warner Cable, and Brian Roberts of Comcast, wrote in a letter to the FCC. \u201cUnder Title II, new service offerings, options, and features would be delayed or altogether foregone. Consumers would face less choice, and a less adaptive and responsive Internet.\u201d\n\nWheeler\u2019s plan would reportedly allow broadband providers to strike special deals with Internet companies for preferential treatment \u2014 sometimes called \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d \u2014 in the \u201clast mile\u201d to consumers\u2019 homes. Such Internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d would threaten innovation, net neutrality advocates argue, because they would put Internet startups \u2014 the next YouTube, Skype or Netflix, perhaps \u2014 at a disadvantage compared to deep pocketed media giants.\n\nIn January, a federal court struck down most of the FCC\u2019s 2010 Open Internet order prohibiting broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon from blocking traffic like Skype or Netflix on wired networks or putting them into an Internet \u201cslow lane.\u201d (Comcast is currently the only broadband company bound by the Open Internet order, as a result of an agreement it made with the government as part of its purchase of media giant NBC Universal.)\n\nWheeler\u2019s plan \u2014 which was leaked to the press two weeks ago \u2014 would allow companies to strike paid-prioritization deals as long as they acted in a \u201ccommercially reasonable manner subject to review on a case-by-case basis.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what kind of financial agreement would be considered \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d because Wheeler\u2019s draft proposal hasn\u2019t even been made public.\n\nLast week, more than 100 Internet giants and startups sent a letter to the FCC expressing alarm over Wheeler\u2019s proposed net neutrality rules. In response, Wheeler wrote that he has \u201cmade clear that if someone acts to divide the Internet between \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have nots,\u2019 I will use every power at my disposal to stop it, including Title II. I will not allow some companies to force Internet users into a slow lane so that others with special privileges can have superior service.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of an intense backlash from Internet giants, startups, venture capitalists, public-interest groups and consumers, Wheeler modified his draft proposal to make Title II reclassification a more realistic option, a FCC official told TIME earlier this week. But any proposal that doesn\u2019t include strict safeguards preventing the largest broadband giants from establishing what net neutrality advocates consider to be a \u201ctwo-tiered Internet\u201d is unlikely to quell the firestorm.",

Copyright protection on the 59 hitherto unreleased songs \u2014 two hours of outtakes, BBC recordings and demos (track list below) \u2014 expires at the end of the December, 50 years after they were recorded.\n\nBut thanks to a November revision of European Union intellectual property laws, copyright protection of released songs is extended to 70 years. If Apple Corps, which owns the copyrights, didn\u2019t make these recordings available for sale, every Beatles collector with bootleg MP3 files could legally put out their own album.\n\nNorwegian Beatles blogger Roger Stormo, who broke the news and published the track list last Tuesday, had the copyright angle by Wednesday. The Guardian and the BBC followed up the next day, predicting a wave of annual bootleg releases just ahead of expiration. As the BBC reported:\n\nBob Dylan\u2019s record label rushed out 100 copies of an album last year containing early TV performances, alongside multiple versions of Blowin\u2019 in the Wind, Bob Dylan\u2019s Dream and I Shall Be Free.\n\nOfficially called The 50th Anniversary Collection, it carried a subtitle which explained its true purpose: The Copyright Extension Collection, Vol. 1.\n\nThe BBC goes on to speculate, based on the low-key nature of the Beatles release, that after a decent interval Paul McCartney et al. will take the new material off iTunes, \u201callowing them to exploit the recordings in a more considered way later on.\u201d\n\n1.

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 Call him the Freddy Krueger of potential presidential nominees. Liberals, feminists, and plain-old targets of his withering dismissiveness may have thought they destroyed Larry Summers\u2019 shot at the Federal Reserve chairmanship. But he\u2019s back \u2014 haunting their dreams of seeing stately womanhood at the helm of the nation\u2019s money supply.\n\nWhite House leakers tell the Washington Post that Summers is still in the running to succeed outgoing Ben Bernanke \u2014 and, by some accounts, even topping the President\u2019s list. A Summers nomination would shock and defy vocal critics who form the core of Obama\u2019s liberal base and have been pushing Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen. And it\u2019s not just liberal activists: Yellen easily trounced Summers in a Reuters poll of economists asking who should be the next Fed chair.\n\nThe Post and others say Summers remains in the mix largely because of President Obama\u2019s close relationship with, and regard for, the economic adviser who guided a new and uncertain administration through the early dark days of a massive recession. Summers is a believer in big, bold government action in the face of hard times. \u201cCould the stimulus be too big?\u201d he once said to me. \u201cThat\u2019s like asking me if I could lose too much weight.\u201d\n\nObama also owes Summers critical political points. As National Economic Council director, Summers vigorously backed bailing out the auto industry. It was a decision that, in his own words on election day last year, led to a \u201cvery different economy in Ohio and a very different economy in Michigan\u201d \u2014 and a losing battle in both states, he noted, for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nMORE: Jack Lew: The known unknown at the Treasury\n\nIf Summers does win the nomination, watch for the White House to counter a powerful storm of criticism with these talking points:\n\n\u2013 Critics say his support for deregulation in the 1990s \u2014 blocking proposals to regulate derivatives and favoring the elimination of Glass-Steagall \u2014 contributed to the financial crisis. But Summers was long a vocal critic of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, arguably far more important contributors to the collapse. As Summers said at a Harvard Kennedy School panel that I moderated earlier this year: \u201cWhen I hear people talk about public-private partnerships, I reach for my wallet. No one used the term more than Fannie Mae, unless it was Freddie Mac. Massive collaboration, massive disaster.\u201d\n\n(Conservative critics could ask where Summers\u2019 suspicions of public-private partnership were hiding when solar company Solyndra was blowing through half a billion dollars of taxpayer money.)\n\n\u2013 Much speculation has, rightly, centered on what a Summers chairmanship would mean for monetary policy. But a key part of the Fed chair\u2019s job is an ability to foresee crises on the horizon \u2014 something all top regulators dropped the ball on pre-2008. So watch for the White House to position Summers as a (rare) seer of dangers to come. In 2006, he worried about the level of risk-taking with these words: \u201cThe main thing we have to fear is lack of fear itself.\u201d\n\nAnd in November of 2007, four months before the collapse of Bear Stearns, he called on policy makers to \u201cwake up to the dangers of a deepening crisis.\u201d He added: \u201cThree months ago it was reasonable to expect that the subprime credit crisis would be a financially significant event but not one that would threaten the overall pattern of economic growth \u2026 Without stronger policy responses than have been observed to date \u2026 there is the risk that the adverse impacts will be felt for the rest of this decade and beyond.\u201d\n\nMORE: Are we ready for the next meltdown?\n\n\u2013 To concerns that Summers is too pro-business, expect the President to talk about their shared concerns over a widening income gap and decreasing social mobility for average Americans. Our \u201clevel of inequality and social mobility has deteriorated,\u201d Summers told the same Harvard audience earlier this year, calling it \u201cstunning\u201d that the ability of both a rich child and a poor child to go to a good college is smaller than it was 30 years ago.\n\n\u2013 Feminists not only support an historical appointment of Yellen as the first female Fed chief, but also view Summers as sexist, based on his controversial women-in-science remarks as Harvard President and his clashes with fellow Obama economic adviser Christina Romer (In the Post story, Romer questions Summers\u2019 management skills). To counter that perception, the White House will likely call upon Facebook FB Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who counts Summers as a mentor in a career that put her at his side at the World Bank and the Treasury Department. (Another powerful woman Summers supported in her career: Facebook Global Public Policy vice president Marne Levine). Sandberg, author of the post-feminist best-seller Lean In, has already publicly defended Summers on this score.\n\nIf the President Obama does tap Summers, the White House will have to mount a defense that gets him to 60 votes in the Senate \u2014 and for that, he\u2019s still likely to need support from Republicans.",

        "text": "We are in the middle of the most elaborate and complex remembering ritual that Europe has devised in the past 2,000 years: Easter. A four-day solemn liturgy turned into a holiday, where crucifixes jostle pagan eggs and chocolate bunnies. An eclectic, shifting remembering.\n\nOur collective memories are welcoming places, and one image, that of Jesus, has absorbed and appropriated elements of other traditions and aspirations in order to shape our communal remembering.\n\nThere is not much we can say with absolute confidence about the early church, but we can be fairly sure that the first Christians would not have dreamed of making a likeness of Jesus. Not just because there was no record of his appearance that they could have based a likeness on, but more because their Jewish inheritance of a god, worshipped in spirit and in truth but emphatically not represented in art, would have inhibited them (as it later did the Muslims) from any such attempt. For the first two or three Christian centuries the idea of looking on the face of God, even in human form, would have been inconceivable. Yet we now all live in a world where the likeness of Christ is commonplace, a cliche repeated in films and books or borrowed for very different purposes by advertising and politics. The decision to try to show the face of Christ was not just a major theological step, but one of the decisive turning points in European visual and, indeed, political culture. We don't know where it first happened, where an artist first tried to capture the likeness of Jesus, and it is probable that many early attempts have been lost. But the strongest candidate for the oldest, securely datable image of Christ was made not for a church in the eastern Mediterranean or imperial Rome, but for the floor of a dining room in Dorset around the year 360.\n\nThe face of Christ in Dorset is now in the British Museum's Weston gallery of Roman Britain. Here, you get an extraordinary impression of what life must have been like in this northernmost province of the Roman empire. The last century of Roman rule (c300-400AD) was, in many ways, a golden age. Roman Britain was prosperous, indeed rich. The ruling class built large villas with huge estates and enormous sums of money were spent on ostentatious decoration and spectacular silver tableware. The hoards of silver found, especially in East Anglia, include bowls, plates, spoons and even pepper pots (pepper was so expensive that it was used to pay part of the ransom that Alaric later demanded from Rome). This is a society that seems to have accommodated itself comfortably to paganism and Christianity. The great silver dish found at Mildenhall in Suffolk shows Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, drunkenly cavorting with pliant nymphs in an elegant and very alcoholic dance: some of the spoons found in the same hoard carry Christian symbols.\n\nThe Dorset dining-room floor mosaic was found in the ruins of a large Roman villa at Hinton St Mary, a small village in the Blackmoor Vale about eight miles from Shaftesbury. It is made mostly of local Dorset materials of black, red or yellowish stone with pieces of ceramic here and there, all set in that greatest of Roman building inventions, cement. In the corners are representations of the four seasons, and there is the usual arrangement of garlands and decorative strips. In the centre of the floor are two roundels. In one, the mythical hero Bellerophon, riding the winged horse Pegasus, overcomes the monster Chimaera. It was a popular image in the Roman world, the hero zapping the forces of evil. In the other roundel, you would have expected to find either Orpheus charming the world with his music, or the wine god Bacchus. But, in Hinton St Mary, it is Christ. In a society that had for centuries been used to seeing its gods, someone had decided that this new god must make an appearance.\n\nBut here the artist must have had a real problem. There was no prototype, no model, no description. He had to invent Christ in order to show him. How do you represent a god that you have never seen? It is a testing conundrum, theologically and artistically. This artist must have seen and made images of Orpheus and Bacchus in similar mosaic floors. Orpheus would generally be wistful, young and artistic-looking. Bacchus would be energetic and sexy. Each would essentially be distinguished by his attributes: Orpheus would have his lyre, Bacchus a bunch of grapes or something similar. You would know who they were, not because of how they looked, but because of what they held. But this is difficult with Jesus. What is Jesus's physical attribute? He told his disciples that he was the way, the truth and the life, but it is very difficult to show any of these physically. He announced that he was the light of the world, but it is extraordinarily hard to show light in a mosaic. And although he did compare himself to a vine and his followers to branches, the vine was the property of Bacchus and could have led only to confusion.\n\nThen there was the question of what general tone his face should carry. Clearly not specifically artistic or pleasure-seeking like Orpheus or Bacchus, but equally, for a Roman public used to seeing their gods as heroes, not looking like a poor suffering man brutally put to death on the gallows.\n\nThe artist at Hinton St Mary found an ingenious and revealing solution: he looked at a coin. At least we can be fairly certain that is what he did. He seems to have taken a coin of the emperor, or of the man who claimed to be emperor and who had usurped Britain and Gaul in the middle of the fourth century, Magnentius. The emperor is shown as you would expect, robed and severe in the circular field of the coin. On the other side, that particular emperor chose the Christian symbol of the chi rho, the two letters that begin Christ's name in Greek, written as though they were X and P in our alphabet. It was the symbol that Constantine, the first Roman emperor to become a Christian, had taken after his conversion and his victories in 313. It had become the logo of the new religion throughout the western empire. On a coin like this (and one has been found in a a grave near Hinton St Mary), Magnentius shows himself not just as emperor, but as a Christian emperor, heir to Constantine.\n\nThe artist has simply combined the front and the back of the coin. So, in the mosaic, an imperial bust looks out at us full-face, robed with authority. We know we are looking at a ruler. And to make it clear that we are looking not at a secular ruler, but at the king of kings, the artist has put the chi rho monogram behind his head. You would not recognise this as the face of Christ, for you would never have seen a picture of Christ before. But you would know this was Christ, and Christ the emperor. Jesus has found his attribute, and it is temporal power. In this, perhaps the oldest surviving image of Jesus, and certainly the oldest known in Britain, we already have the fusion - perhaps deliberate confusion - of the authority of God and the authority of Man. In mid-fourth-century England, it is no longer possible to distinguish what should be rendered unto Caesar and what should be rendered unto God, because Caesar claims God's authority on a coin and God looks like Caesar in the mosaic.\n\nYet the artist wanted to show more: that this man was not only lord of life but lord over death. So, he has put a pomegranate either side of Christ's head. For any Dorset diner, this would resemble the myth of Persephone carried off to the underworld by Pluto, rescued by her mother and brought back to the land of the living as a great allegory of the cycle of the seasons, of death and rebirth, of descent into hell and return to the light. By the inclusion of this simple fruit, the artist links Jesus to much older resurrection myths: to Persephone, and to Orpheus, who went to the underworld in search of Eurydice. In each case, the miracle was accomplished by love. This Christ pulls together the hopes of the ancient world, the deepest of all human hopes, that love is stronger than death.\n\nThe Hinton St Mary mosaic is a striking example of how memories can be manipulated to create new meanings. The association of imperial power that the coin image evokes is so strong that it overwhelms every other aspect of the life and teaching of Jesus, tying the church firmly to the apparatus of the state. It is an irony of history that it should appear in England, for it documents an important early step towards the established church. And the pomegranate associations show that this church was, even then, a broad one: there was no need to cast off the old religion completely before embracing the new. This is both/and, not either/or theology. It is the spiritual equivalent of fusion cuisine. There is no reason to suppose it was any less nourishing.\n\n\u00b7 Neil MacGregor is director of the British Museum. The Hinton St Mary Mosaic can be seen in The Museum of the Mind, Art and Memory in World Cultures at the British Museum, London WC1, until September 7. Details: 020-7323 8000.

The artist also included pomegranates on either side of Christ's head, symbolizing death and rebirth.

        "text": "Two good, new books are now shedding light on the controversial environmental lawsuit filed in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, in 2003, which culminated in a $18.2 billion judgment against Chevron CVX in February 2011, later reduced to $9.5 billion. But Steven Donziger, the plaintiffs lead U.S. lawyer, is alleging that one of the books defames him, and appears to be leading a smear campaign against its author.\n\nThe suit stems from contamination allegedly left behind by Texaco (acquired by Chevron in 2001) when it drilled for oil in the Amazon rainforest of eastern Ecuador from 1964 to 1992. Many environmentalists and human-rights advocates regard the case as a historic victory for third-world peoples.\n\nIt\u2019s also the case, however, in which a Manhattan federal judge concluded last March, in a 485\u2013page, 1842-footnote ruling, that Donziger achieved the historic judgment through bribery, fraud, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and other crimes. The jurist, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, barred any American court from enforcing the Ecuadorian judgment, and barred Donziger from personally benefiting from it, even if some non-U.S. court ever does enforce it. Donziger denies wrongdoing and has appealed. (Chevron has virtually no assets in Ecuador, so the judgment is worthless unless the plaintiffs can persuade a court to honor it in a country where Chevron does have assets.)\n\nPaul M. Barrett\u2019s book, The Law of the Jungle: The $19 Billion Legal Battle Over Oil in the Rain Forest and the Lawyer Who\u2019d Stop at Nothing to Win It (Crown Publishers, 304 pages, $26), is due for release on September 23, while Michael Goldhaber\u2019s Kindle Single ebook, Crude Awakening: Chevron in Ecuador (RosettaBooks, 27,000 words, $2.99), came out last month.\n\nBoth authors are highly experienced, well-credentialed journalists. Barrett, an assistant managing editor and senior writer for Bloomberg BusinessWeek, graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, while Goldhaber, the \u201cThe Global Lawyer\u201d columnist for The American Lawyer, has degrees from Harvard College, Columbia Journalism School, and Yale Law School. The Law of the Jungle is Barrett\u2019s fourth book (his last one, Glock: The Rise of America\u2019s Gun, became a New York Times bestseller), while Crude Awakening is Goldhaber\u2019s second, after A People\u2019s History of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe books are complementary, rather than redundant, because the authors have different aspirations. Barrett has written an accessible, fast-paced read for the generalist, providing both an overview of the whole environmental dispute and vivid portrait of Donziger, the larger-than-life enigma at the center of the litigation. Goldhaber\u2019s more specialized work is aimed at lawyers and others in the field, focusing on the detective work that enabled Chevron to unearth Donziger\u2019s alleged crimes, on the baroque intricacy of the alleged wrongdoing, and on broad legal questions presented by global human rights litigation generally. Goldhaber is a less mellifluous writer than Barrett, so his book will be a tougher read, even for lawyers. Still, in litigation, the devil is in the details, and Goldhaber presents more of those appalling details.\n\nBoth authors attended much of Chevron\u2019s civil racketeering trial against Donziger in Manhattan last fall, and both appear to conclude that Donziger was guilty of almost all of the wrongdoing Chevron alleged. (For a summary of the key accusations, see my companion piece, \u201cWhere\u2019s Preet?\u201d also being published today.) At the same time, both authors\u2014like Judge Kaplan himself, as he acknowledged in his ruling\u2014remain troubled about the unresolved merits of the underlying dispute, i.e., the question of whether Texaco behaved improperly in Ecuador and whether Chevron, as a consequence, still owes recompense, notwithstanding Texaco\u2019s prior environmental settlement with the Ecuadorian government in 1998. Goldhaber even pledges to donate his book royalties to \u201cthe indigenous peoples of Ecuador,\u201d and closes his book by calling upon Chevron, \u201cwithout honoring its corrupt adversaries or their false narratives, to make a similar gesture of good will for all residents of the region.\u201d\n\nBarrett wrote a very sympathetic cover story about Donziger for BusinessWeek in March 2011\u2014one that Donziger\u2019s public relations person, Karen Hinton, was so pleased with at the time that she distributed it to all the reporters covering the case. Barrett\u2019s views have evolved since then, however, and the portrait of Donziger here is less forgiving. The book culminates in an exceedingly telling incident that plays out between Barrett and Donziger in a bistro near Donziger\u2019s Upper West Side apartment late last year. To preserve suspense, I won\u2019t give that one away.\n\nDespite the focus on Donziger, Barrett also provides a valuable and, for the most part, scrupulously even-handed account of the context of the underlying case. He begins, for instance, with the memories of a Cof\u00e1n Indian leader, whose life was turned upside down shortly after Texaco\u2019s helicopters first began hovering over his homeland in 1964. \u201cBefore long, a multicolored sheen appeared on the surface of the streams where the Cof\u00e1n fished and bathed and gathered drinking water,\u201d Barrett writes. \u201cCof\u00e1n children began to suffer from unfamiliar stomach ailments that neither the shaman\u2019s roots, nor the missionaries\u2019 medicine, could cure.\u201d Later, two of the leader\u2019s children died from diseases that the man believes were caused by oil contamination.\n\nAt the same time, Barrett suggests that the Republic of Ecuador shares plenty of responsibility for everything that happened, having invited Texaco into the country; having ignored the environmental problems as they were occurring; having been the majority partner in the drilling venture from 1977 onwards; and having, when taxes are taken into account, extracted 93 percent of the profits from the joint venture during its years of operation. Ecuador\u2019s state-owned oil company, Petroecuador, also continued drilling in the region after Texaco pulled out 22 years ago, compiling an even worse environmental record than its former joint-venture partner, Barrett suggests, and complicating efforts to separate out Texaco\u2019s responsibility today.\n\nWhile Barrett does provide a basically fair overview, my subjective opinion is that he is sometimes too uncritical in permiting Donziger, when attacking Chevron, to gin up mountains out of molehills and to level unsubstantiated accusations. This enables Barrett to conclude that \u201cboth sides were doing business of one sort or another with the devil.\u201d\n\nBut if Barrett does sometimes give Donziger\u2019s bare accusations too much credence, it\u2019s unlikely he will make the same mistake again in the future, because Donziger is now dishing out unsubstantiated smears at Barrett himself in an effort to dissuade people from reading or crediting his book.\n\nIn fact, both Goldhaber and Barrett deserve commendation for ever having enlisted for the project of writing about this case. It had to have been clear from the outset that anyone who did so conscientiously\u2014a task that would necessarily include discussing the overwhelming evidence of Donziger\u2019s use of mendacity and intimidation to achieve his goals\u2014would end up being tarred with baseless attacks on their integrity emanating from Donziger\u2019s camp. (A Google search of my own name\u2014for I, too, have been writing about this case for the past four years\u2014usually turns up at least two of these retaliatory, search-optimized, diatribes.)\n\nThough Donziger\u2019s team is also taking Goldhaber to task, it is Barrett who is getting pelted with most of the mud at the moment, doubtless because Donziger\u2019s people recognize that his book, aimed at the general reader, stands the greater chance of scoring wide impact.\n\nThe attacks on Barrett began on July 31 with an 1650-word, unsigned broadside on The Chevron Pit, a web site that has, in the past at least, been controlled by Donziger and his public relations person, Karen Hinton, according to testimony and emails that emerged during the civil racketeering litigation. Hinton says she no longer works on that site, and it\u2019s difficult to say authoritatively who controls it now since most of its posts are signed only \u201cAdmin.\u201d and it identifies its staff only as \u201cthe team working to hold oil giant Chevron accountable for its human rights and environmental abuses in Ecuador.\u201d (I\u2019m not linking here to the Chevron Pit post attacking Barrett\u2014or those attacking me, for that matter\u2014in part because I think they\u2019re defamatory, but also because Google takes such links into account in determining the prominence to give such blogposts in search results. Why Google still allows its results to be so easily manipulated by malevolent, anonymous smear campaigns is a topic for another day.)\n\nIn any case, the initial Chevron Pit assault was followed by an unsigned, 1200-word \u201ccritique\u201d that Hinton emailed to reporters on September 3.\n\nThe broadsides claim that Barrett\u2019s book is \u201criddled\u201d or \u201creplete\u201d with \u201cerrors,\u201d but neither gives specific, verifiable examples. Each accuses Barrett of suffering from \u201cconflicts of interest,\u201d but the specifics are vapid to the point of unintelligibility. The first alleged \u201cblatant conflict\u201d is that Barrett wrote the book while also continuing to write for Bloomberg BusinessWeek, an arrangement that his employer and publisher both knew about and approved of, and one that is obviously both benign and routine.\n\nThe second alleged conflict is that Barrett accepted the invitation of a U.S. House Foreign Affairs subcommittee to testify about the case last July. The calumniators speculate that Chevron arranged for the hearing to take place (which a spokesperson for Chevron denies), and then further speculate that Chevron arranged for Barrett to be called as a witness (which Chevron and Barrett both deny). A Chevron spokesman told me he was surprised\u2014and chagrined\u2014to discover that Barrett was testifying, since Barrett\u2019s book suggests that Texaco behaved improperly in Ecuador, a proposition that is obviously inimical to Chevron\u2019s core legal position. In an email Barrett tells me that he knows how the invitation came about: \u201cA Latin American journalist I know has friends who work on the subcommittee staff. He told them about my book. When their hearing came up, they called me to ask if I would testify. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nNext, and more seriously, the attacks accuse Barrett of bias\u2014specifically, of having told unidentified people that he \u201cplanned to use his book to \u2018take down\u2019 Donziger.\u201d In an email to me, Barrett says, \u201cThis is a lie. I never said this.\u201d\n\nAsked when, where, and to whom Barrett made these \u201cexplicit threats,\u201d as the Pit post calls them, Hinton said that she was \u201cnot involved in writing\u201d either the Chevron Pit post or the \u201ccritique\u201d that she blast-emailed to reporters. She said she would forward my inquiries to Donziger.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Donziger said, first of all, that I should not be writing a review of the Barrett or Goldhaber books at all, because I, too, have a \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d in that he does not deem my coverage of the case to have been \u201cbalanced.\u201d As for Barrett\u2019s alleged \u201cthreat,\u201d he says it was made to \u201ca person on our legal team,\u201d but \u201cI am not going to provide more details at this point for various litigation-related reasons.\u201d Donziger added that he had written a detailed letter to Barrett, his agent, and his publisher \u201coutlining some of the defamatory statements in the book\u201d which, he claims, \u201ccreate exposure for Barrett and the publisher,\u201d though he did not indicate which statements those were. (Matthew Martin, senior vice president and associate general counsel for Penguin Random House\u2014Crown\u2019s parent\u2014said, \u201cWhile we generally refrain from commenting on pending legal claims or litigation, I can tell you that Law of the Jungle was carefully and diligently researched over many years and we stand fully behind Paul Barrett\u2019s reporting.\u201d )\n\nThe Chevron Pit post also asserts that Barrett \u201cnever interviewed a single member of the legal team for the villagers,\u201d and both broadsides fault Barrett for giving too little attention to the team\u2019s key Ecuadorian leaders, Pablo Fajardo and Luis Yanza. The assertions are both inaccurate and highly misleading. As Barrett explains in the book itself, \u201cSteve Donziger spoke to me at length for the initial [BusinessWeek] magazine profile [in March 2011] and in the months thereafter. When my attention turned to this book, however, he cut off communication and discouraged certain other people from cooperating.\u201d In an interview with me, Barrett specifies that he had actually already booked interviews with Fajardo and Yanza, among others, and was at the Miami airport waiting for his flight to depart, when Donziger intervened and saw to it that those were cancelled.\n\nDonziger admitted to me that he stopped speaking to Barrett\u2014citing both qualms with Barrett\u2019s reporting and legal advice from his attorney. He also admitted having \u201cshared [his] thoughts\u201d about speaking to Barrett with \u201cmembers of his local team, including Fajardo and Yanza,\u201d but said that they \u201cdecided independently to not cooperate with Barrett. . . . These sentient beings make their own decisions about their lives, including whether to conduct interviews with reporters like Barrett.\u201d\n\nBut whatever their reasons for not talking to Barrett, there is no dispute that it was their decision\u2014not Barrett\u2019s. The calumniators are implying that Barrett failed to reach out to these people for their perspectives when in fact, as they well know, Barrett reached out, but the people in question refused to speak to him. That\u2019s absurdly misleading.\n\nFinally, the Chevron Pit blog poster asserts that he or she knows of \u201cmultiple reports\u201d that \u201cChevron is quietly helping to promote\u201d Barrett\u2019s book. The post doesn\u2019t link to any of those \u201creports,\u201d though, and, for the reasons mentioned above, the allegation seems preposterous on its face. Barrett\u2019s book is very sympathetic to the plight of the people Donziger represents, critical of Texaco and Chevron, and quite harsh\u2014sometimes unduly so, in my view\u2014toward Chevron\u2019s counsel at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. It likens Gibson Dunn at one point, for instance, to \u201ca \u2018cleaner,\u2019\u201d that is, \u201can underworld specialist in the art of tidying up bloody crime scenes.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked for more specifics about the alleged \u201creports\u201d that Chevron was promoting Barrett\u2019s book, Donziger provided none, except to claim that they emanated from somewhere in Ecuador. He then repeated the calumniators\u2019 rank speculation that Chevron engineered Barrett\u2019s testimony before the House committee.\n\nThe mendacity and intimidation evinced in these reckless attacks on Barrett are of a piece with the conduct that Judge Kaplan found to have marred so many key aspects of Donziger\u2019s case against Chevron in Ecuador. Again and again, Donziger has undermined a plausible legal case with needless, transparent, and despicable lies.",

One business backed by Flybridge, digital marketing firm dataXu, is among a handful of local tech outfits that analysts say will try to go public within the next year. Others include Waltham data-storage company Actifio Inc., Burlington-based software firm Acquia Inc., and cybersecurity companies Bit9 Inc. and Veracode Inc.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time high of 17,279 in mid-September, the Dow Jones industrial average entered a steep dive late last week that bottomed out at 16,117 Thursday. On Friday, the index clawed back to 16,380, though that leaves the Dow slightly down on the year.\n\nAs the next wave of companies consider going public, the experiences of two marquee Boston-area companies that concluded IPOs in the past few weeks don\u2019t offer easy lessons.\n\nShares of Boston-based online home goods retailer Wayfair floundered after a strong opening, sinking as low as 22 percent below its initial $29 price before rallying somewhat Friday. But digital marketer HubSpot has mostly been riding high, its shares remaining well above the IPO price of $25.\n\nSome investors cautioned against drawing conclusions from Wayfair\u2019s and HubSpot\u2019s performances so far.\n\n\u201cIs this is a sneeze, a cold, the flu? No one knows yet,\u201d said Maia Heymann, senior managing director of Cambridge venture capital firm CommonAngels Ventures. \u201cGreat companies that are growing and hitting their plans can get out even in choppy markets.\u201d\n\nThe market turmoil comes amidst a bumper crop of IPOs. According to Renaissance Capital, 316 companies have filed to go public so far this year, compared to 256 in all of 2013.\n\nHeymann and other investors are counseling against panic. They say the recent market dive is unlikely to be a harbinger of a larger collapse, and that a healthy dose of skepticism keeps bubbles from forming. Some investors even use the market turmoil to remind entrepreneurs to make sure their companies are in sound shape.\n\n\u201cWhat this really requires them to do is make sure the fundamentals are there: the numbers, the story, the positioning,\u201d said Sean Dalton, a partner at Highland Capital Partners. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there, this is a chance to slow things down a little bit and make sure you address those deficiencies.\u201d\n\nIn going public, investors said companies must consider factors including how much money they have on hand now, the size of their company, and how well-known their brand is.\n\nLarger, established companies have it easier; they\u2019re less likely to be blown by daily market winds. But for smaller companies, getting IPO timing right can be a life-or-death decision.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller company and your stock goes south on the first day, a lot of shareholders will just dump,\u201d said Ben Howe, chief executive of investment bank America\u2019s Growth Capital. \u201cTo get them back in and committed after you\u2019ve disappointed them like that is really hard.\u201d\n\nInvestors noted that an IPO is an expensive and potentially distracting challenge. Companies must satisfy regulatory requirements, carefully manage shareholder expectations, and spend time on the road schmoozing investment bankers and potential investors. The further along a company is in that process, the more likely it is to complete an IPO, whatever the market conditions.\n\nFor pre-IPO companies that decide to wait, the delays may be especially frustrating because market volatility is often triggered by remote events that have little bearing on their business. \u201cIf you\u2019re the CEO of a private tech company, you can neither control those things or let yourself get too distracted by them,\u2019\u2019 Bussgang said.",

        "text": "Last month, the Souls Grown Deep Foundation made a major gift of 57 artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It\u2019s a big score for the New York museum to garner so many gems from the African American south, including work by Nellie Mae Rowe, Thorton Dial, and \u2013 the biggest coup \u2013 20 of the Gee\u2019s Bend quilts.\n\nIf the star works of art of the Harlem Renaissance were Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s novels, James Weldon Johnson\u2019s poetry, and Romare Bearden\u2019s paintings, the stars of the modern interest in southern African American folk art are unquestionably the quilts made by the women of the tiny hamlet of Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. This is where a collective of women have become the reason you\u2019ve seen so many quilting patterns in greeting cards, calendars and picture books in the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe Gee\u2019s Bend project has such a compelling story of origins in terms of its rootedness in civil rights,\u201d says Riche Richardson, an associate professor of Africana Studies at Cornell University. A quilter herself whose work has been exhibited in museums, Richardson describes the quilting from Gee\u2019s Bend as historically significant but also \u201cbreathtaking in its beauty, scope and composition. As a native Alabamian and artist, I believe that it is crucially important to recognize and honor the genius of Southern art, including its important and unique contribution to the nation\u2019s artistic and cultural heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe remarkable artists of Gee\u2019s Bend are among those at the vanguard in this sense,\u201d Richardson says. Indeed, despite being made far from traditionally championed urban sites of American design (the town is populated just by a few hundred people, most of whom are descendants of slaves), the quilts are shamelessly modern and hold up with a surprisingly contemporary aesthetic.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t always heralded, discounted like much of the artwork created by African Americans in the south historically. As the New York Times reported in 2007, the quilts made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend were largely ignored until, in the late 1990s, William Arnett, \u201ca white champion of self-taught black artists, began a rescue mission, buying dozens of the quilts and ultimately creating one of the biggest surprise hits in the art world\u2019s recent memory.\u201d Arnett went on to form the Souls Deep Foundation, which is giving the collection named after him to the Met.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s donation also includes 10 works by Thorton Dial, including Out of the Darkness, the Lord Gave Us Light and African Athlete. Dial grew up in a rural Alabama sharecropping family, worked in manufacturing jobs, and has no formal training as an artist. His work uses elements of found objects, painting and sculpture usually attributed to the likes of artists like Jasper Johns. However, as the magazine Arts Atl wrote in 2012, \u201cfound-object assemblage flourished before Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg made the practice famous,\u201d noting that \u201cRauschenberg grew up looking at African-American yard art, castoffs and discards arranged into provocative displays.\u201d That would be the same kind of work Dial would have grown up around, and was making himself, long before Rauschenberg\u2019s work was hung in the museums or galleries of New York.\n\nWhile the donation to the Met is a gem, it is not without controversy.

As the Times quoted Andrew Dietz, the author of a book about Arnett\u2019s relationship with artists whose work is in the Souls Grown Deep donation: \u201c\u2018When you mix the old South, race, educational and class differences, the subjective value of art, the egos of the art elite and the good old greenback, you\u2019ve got yourself a powder keg ready to blow.\u201d\n\nThe Souls Grown Deep\u2019s powder keg was diffused, even if the bigger issues of race continue to roil American art and expression. The donation will be curated for a show at the Met in the fall of 2016.",

        "text": "Ask many up-and-coming retirees what their biggest fear is, and they\u2019ll say running out of money. Just 18% of workers are very confident that they\u2019ll have enough money for a comfortable retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute\u2019s 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey.\n\nThe insurance industry has heard those worries loud and clear, and they\u2019ve answered with longevity annuities. What are they? Essentially, these are simple deferred annuities that ask you to hand over a lump sum of cash to an insurance company in exchange for a guaranteed income decades down the road.\n\nLongevity annuities aren\u2019t new. But you\u2019ll likely see many more of them after the New Year \u2013 from big names like New York Life, Guardian and Mass Mutual \u2014 now that a new law says they can be purchased inside of 401(k) and IRA plans so long as the account holder begins collecting on the policy by age 85, rather than age 70 \u00bd \u2014 the age when required minimum distributions must begin.\n\nHere\u2019s how this looks in practice. Let\u2019s say you have a $500,000 IRA. Under the rules, you\u2019re allowed to take 25% of that account or $125,000, whichever is less, and buy a longevity annuity. The amount of your paychecks will depend on when you opt to start taking the income; the longer you wait, the lower your life expectancy, so the higher your monthly checks will be. But because you put $125,000 into the annuity, instead of taking required minimum distributions on the full $500,000, they\u2019d be based on the remaining $375,000. If you die before you start receiving income you can structure it so 100% of the value will go to your beneficiaries; even if you\u2019ve turned on the income stream, you can set it up so that the remainder goes to beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cThese annuities have been around for 10 years, but they\u2019ve only really been sold for three and they only represent a little more than 2% of annuity sales. This ruling is going to educate the public on how these products work,\u201d says Stan Haithcock, an annuities expert. Haithcock is a fan of these products for their simplicity. (Variable and index annuities don\u2019t qualify under the new law.) \u201cThis is an easy to understand pension product. I could explain it to a 9-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cMy prediction is that in 5 years, they will be the number one type of annuity in the country.\u201d\n\nShould you take the bait? The downside to these products involves liquidity and flexibility. \u201cYou can\u2019t change your mind and say, \u2018send me all my money back,\u2019\u201d Haithcock says. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason the government put a limitation on what you can put in.\u201d You should also steer clear if you need all of the money you expect to get from RMDs to live on. \u201cThis isn\u2019t for the person who needs more money from their IRA or needs to access a lifetime income stream sooner,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the vast majority of [people] with traditional IRA wealth will be okay with pushing some of these assets.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether you can create an income stream of your own that allows you to maintain more control over your assets.\n\n\u201cIn my practice, I\u2019m employing something along the lines of a bucket strategy, which means there are three buckets of money \u2014 a stock bucket, a bond bucket and a cash bucket. Typically, clients will have two to five years of expected withdrawals in the cash bucket, so you\u2019re creating your own income stream and it\u2019s no different from what the insurance companies are trying to do,\u201d explains New York Certified Financial Planner Bill Losey. The missing element for the DIY approach: guaranteed income. You may do better than you would with an annuity. Then again, you may do worse.\n\nFinally, if you do go down this road, Haithcock says to be wary of agents who try to change the discussion to variable or index products where they\u2019ll get more money. They\u2019ll try to change the conversation. Don\u2019t let them. \u201cThis option was put on the planet for young workers to be able to put money away that is targeted to lifetime income stream,\u201d he says. If today\u2019s retiree fears are indicative of the future, they\u2019ll need it.\n\nArielle O\u2019Shea contributed to this report.",

Here are the key points from Facebook\u2019s fourth quarter earnings report.\n\nWhat you need to know: The social networking giant continued to ride a strong mobile ad business to $3.85 billion in quarterly revenue \u2014 an increase of 49% from $2.6 billion during the same quarter a year earlier. Facebook\u2019s quarterly profits totaled $701 million, or 25 cents per share, representing a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nOnce again, Facebook FB got a bulk of its revenue from mobile ads as it surpassed analyst expectations of $3.7 billion in revenue. Facebook\u2019s sales have grown by about 60% in each of the previous two quarters with much of those gains attributed to mobile ads. Despite topping analysts\u2019 forecasts, Facebook\u2019s fourth quarter saw the company\u2019s slowest rate of quarterly sales growth since early-2013 and the company\u2019s shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nThe company also provided full-year financial results, showing a 58% bump in annual revenue, to $12.5 billion, and $2.9 billion in profits \u2014 nearly double 2013\u2019s profits.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot done in 2014,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \u201cOur community continues to grow and we\u2019re making progress towards connecting the world,\u201d\n\nThe big number: Facebook ended 2014 with 1.39 billion monthly active users (MAUs), which was up 13% from 2013.

        "text": "This article is published in partnership with Time.com. The original version can be found here.\n\nLast May, Duke University\u2019s Vice Chancellor for clinical research, Dr. Robert Califf, told an audience of executives that the American system for developing drugs and medical devices was in crisis. Using slides [pdf] developed by Duke\u2019s business school, he said the system was too slow and too expensive, and required disruption and transformation. Towards the end of his talk, he put up a slide that identified a key barrier to change: regulation.\n\nSuch views are not uncommon in industry, academic research and on Capitol Hill, but they are noteworthy coming from Califf because he could soon be America\u2019s top regulator overseeing the safety and efficacy of the country\u2019s drugs and medical devices. Califf is already set to become deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next month. Now sources familiar with the process tell TIME he is on President Barack Obama\u2019s short list to run the agency following this month\u2019s announcement that its long-serving commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, will step down in March.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on pending personnel decisions, but word that Califf is in contention for the top spot at the FDA comes at a key moment. The agency faces potentially dramatic changes this year as Congress prepares to rewrite many of the rules for how drugs and medical devices are reviewed and tested for safety and efficacy. Califf is widely respected in the public and private sectors, but his candidacy is seen by some as a threat to the independence and authority of the FDA, thanks to his views on the need to accelerate change and his deep financial and intellectual ties to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\n\nCaliff says his salary is contractually underwritten in part by several large pharmaceutical companies, including Merck & Co. Inc MRK , Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY , Eli Lilly & Co. LLY and Novartis SA NVSEF . He also receives as much as $100,000 a year in consulting fees from some of those companies, and from others, according to his 2014 conflict of interest disclosure [pdf].\n\nIn an interview with TIME, Califf estimates that less than half of his annual income comes from research money provided by the pharmaceutical industry, though he says he is not certain because he doesn\u2019t tend to distinguish between industry and government research funding. He says he is divesting his holdings in two privately-held pharmaceutical companies he helped get off the ground.\n\nCaliff says such collaboration, not just between industry and academia, but with government, too, is the way of the future. \u201cThe greatest progress almost certainly will be made by breaking out of insular knowledge bases and collaborating across the different sectors,\u201d Califf says. He says there is \u201ca tension which cannot be avoided between regulating an industry and creating the conditions where the industry can thrive, and the FDA\u2019s got to do both.\u201d He says it would be \u201cuseful to have someone [leading the FDA] who understands how companies operate because you\u2019re interacting with them all the time.\u201d\n\nDiana Zuckerman, President of the National Center for Health Research, which advocates for FDA regulatory authority, says such ties \u201cshould be of great concern.\u201d Dr. Califf is \u201ca very accomplished, smart physician who\u2019s been an important name in the field,\u201d Zuckerman says, but his \u201cinterdependent relationships\u201d raise questions about his \u201cobjectivity and distance.\u201d She cites several studies suggesting the medical products industry uses such ties to influence the behavior and decision making of doctors and researchers, even when the scientists don\u2019t realize it.\n\nThe tension over Califf\u2019s collaboration with industry gets to the heart of the future of the FDA at a pivotal moment. While FDA defenders see the collaboration as a threat to its independence, others see close relationships between government, industry and academia as the model for the future. Califf heads a successful and powerful clinical research program, the Duke Translational Medicine Institute, which brings together industry drug researchers, academic scientists and federal regulators to speed drug development and approval. Califf estimates 50-60% of its $320 million in annual research funding comes from industry.\n\nCapitol Hill is considering codifying parts of that collaborative model for the FDA. The powerful Energy and Commerce Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives recently introduced a draft bill called 21st Century Cures, which would loosen the drug approval and post-market oversight process. Califf says because the bill is still in draft it is too early to pass an overall judgment on it but he says, \u201cI support a lot of the concepts in the bill.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee has begun work on its own bill, with committee chairman Lamar Alexander declaring, \u201cIt takes too long and costs too much to develop medical products.\u201d In a report paving the way for his legislation, Alexander concluded the FDA has grown too large, has fallen behind scientific innovation and threatens American leadership in biomedical innovation. Reform efforts in the Senate may be aided by the support of liberals like Elizabeth Warren who back looser regulations on the medical device industry.\n\nThe FDA uses a model for drug testing and oversight largely developed in the early 1960s, with phased trials before drugs and devices are approved for sale to ensure they are safe and effective, and \u201cpost-market\u201d studies afterwards to monitor them. Over time, the agency has come to rely on the medical product industry for more than 60% of its budget for post-market monitoring. Accused of regulatory capture by those who see undue industry influence, the FDA has faced attacks from both sides.\n\nThat means the FDA has few defenders and will rely heavily on its next commissioner to stand up for it in public and on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis is a very dangerous time for the agency,\u201d says Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, \u201cIt\u2019s under fire in a way that is unprecedented in the last 20 years.\u201d\n\nCaliff\u2019s supporters point out that he is among the ten most cited medical authors in America, and that he has spent his career as a clinician helping patients. Regarding the danger of regulators being \u201ccaptured\u201d by their interactions with industry, Califf says, \u201cThe difference between capture and collaboration towards improving human health is a pretty big difference.\u201d\n\nThe White House has set no time frame for its decision on Hamburg\u2019s replacement. It has announced the acting commissioner will be Dr. Stephen Ostroff, a scientist and long-time official at the Health and Human Services department, when she steps down in March.",

        "text": "Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d album. When it was released in 1975, vinyl records ruled supreme, and this particular one would eventually reach platinum sales status sixteen times over.\n\nOh, but how times have changed. Artists who are almost entirely guitar-free top the Billboard charts now, and downloading and streaming seem to be the dominant methods of music consumption. Vinyl did see an increase in sales of more than 50% in 2014, but overall album sales fell by 11% that year, including digital album sales. It all adds up to bad news for a guitar-slinging band that embodies the vinyl era.\n\nDespite this daunting fact, the Led Zeppelin back catalog is in the middle of a deluxe reissue campaign that began in June 2014. All of its albums are in the process of being re-released on vinyl, compact disc and digital download configurations, and so far the group\u2019s first five albums have made their way to music store shelves. Today, \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d gets its turn at bat, and then only two more studio albums remain before the hoards run dry.\n\nThe decision to embark on an extensive reissue campaign comes at a time when compact disc sales declined 15 percent in the past year, according to Billboard. Starbucks SBUX , one of the remaining vestiges of compact disc sales in the U.S., recently announced that it will stop selling them entirely at all of its 21,000 locations in March.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this mean the decision to relaunch the entire catalog is a little dicey?\n\nAs it turns out, no. The group\u2019s 1971 album Led Zeppelin IV was reissued in October 2014 and re-entered the Billboard charts at number seven, just a handful of slots away from Taylor Swift. Clearly, there is still a market out there for this music, and it\u2019s big enough to justify a physical release at a time in history that\u2019s not exactly favorable to that sort of thing.\n\nThose wishing to keep it simple can just buy the remastered album, or they can pay a little extra and get the \u201cdeluxe\u201d edition, supplemented with seven bonus tracks. But for those for whom money is no object, or who simply like to show off, there\u2019s the \u201cSuper Deluxe Edition\u201d boxed set.\n\nA true test of what the market will bear, it contains the album and bonus tracks on compact disc, vinyl and a high-resolution download accessible via a code found on the inside. It also includes a 96-page, LP-sized hardcover book. Altogether, the whole shebang costs approximately $120 and weighs approximately ten pounds, so don\u2019t drop it on your foot.\n\nWho, exactly, is going to buy this thing? Jon Lambert, general manager of the legendary Princeton Record Exchange in Princeton, N.J., told Fortune that based on what he\u2019s observed since the campaign began last year, the super deluxe box sets are indeed selling, albeit in \u201cdrips and drabs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main demographic for the big, boxed items is men between the ages of 30 and 50,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be a little well-heeled to buy the box set.\u201d\n\nHe said that while Super Deluxe Editions of \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d sell somewhat lackadaisically, the mid-priced, single-format configurations have been moving steadily and at a brisk pace. He also added an interesting side note \u2014 those sales are almost entirely driven by young people, whose parents are old enough to have seen Led Zeppelin perform. And despite the vintage format, these kids are \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d buying more vinyl than compact discs, he said.\n\n\u201cLed Zeppelin has transferred generations,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cIt\u2019s still selling. Younger people are still buying those artists. Jack White sells well too, but classic artists are going to sell well, like Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones.\u201d\n\nThere are still two more studio albums left before the Led Zeppelin reissue campaign wraps up. But while the tricked-out Super Deluxe Editions are likely to remain the province of well-to-do baby boomers, customers who are younger and less affluent will likely keep on buying the single-format configuration and keep this music alive for the foreseeable future.",

They'll be ahead of schedule in their rehab and they'll be ready to come back, stronger than ever.\n\nAll have been said of Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer, but when he sat at the podium at the team's headquarters on Thursday -- the first time he has done so since his emotional press conference less than 24 hours after suffering a season-ending torn ACL in Week 10 against the St. Louis Rams -- Palmer was refreshingly free of hyperbole.\n\n\"There's ahead of schedule and then there's professional-athlete ahead of schedule or behind schedule,\" Palmer said. \"That gets kind of blown out of proportion, but I'm going to be ready to rock and roll by the season. I'm definitely going to be ready for (training) camp and shooting to be getting reps in our mandatory mini(camp) and hopefully some of the OTA practices.\"\n\nIt's been 116 days since Palmer suffered the injury, but he is walking without any hint of a limp and has been running for two to three weeks. He is doing squats, leg presses, pulling sleds and is pretty close to resuming a normal workout.\n\nHe said he's in rehab Monday through Friday for about four to five hours, with running and hard agility drills on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, lifting on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and throwing every day.\n\n\"The last month has really been fun against because I'm actually lifting weights and getting ready for 2015,\" he said.\n\nPalmer said the knee injury he suffered in 2005 in Cincinnati -- one he has described as much worse than this one -- helped him know what to expect in this rehab process.\n\n\"A lot more than I expected,\" he said. \"A lot of things come back to you that you had forgotten about.\"\n\nAs anyone would expect, Palmer said it was difficult to watch the team compete in the playoffs without him. He also said he was in a funk for a while and had to apologize to his wife later when he realized all the things that he had missed by being so self-absorbed.\n\n\"We had a date night,\" Palmer said. \"She brought that up, and I quickly changed the subject.\"\n\nIt's unknown how much coach Bruce Arians will allow Palmer to participate in OTAs and minicamp when it really isn't necessary at this point in his career, but it's a safe bet the Cardinals will be conservative and err on the side of caution if there is any doubt about his readiness.\n\nWhile Palmer lamented the loss of Darnell Dockett to the 49ers on Thursday, he also expressed relief that receiver Larry Fitzgerald will be back for two more years. He also anticipates GM Steve Keim being aggressive to improve the roster when free agency begins next week. To that end, Palmer said he agreed to restructure his contract about a month ago to help the team's cap situation and free-agency plans.\n\n\"They've done a good job since Steve and Bruce have been together,\" Palmer said. \"The sky's the limit. My expectations are very high that we're going to get even better next week.\"\n\nFollow Craig Morgan on Twitter",

Its shares are down almost 50% from an all-time high of $97.60 a few months ago.\n\nMichael Kors reported an unexpected 5.8% decline in stores open a year or more, including a 6.7% drop in North America, its biggest market by far. Analysts had been expecting a North American increase in such comparable sales \u2014 a widely accepted measure of a retailer\u2019s health \u2014 of 3%, according to Consensus Metrix.\n\nThe company, long a Wall Street darling, had gotten investors used to seeing 20%+ growth rates in comparable sales since it went public in late 2011. It has been one of the fastest growing brands in recent years, stealing market share away from its handbag rival Coach COH .\n\nTo ride its wave of popularity, Kors has been on a store-opening rampage, adding 121 new stores in the fiscal year that ended March 28 alone, bringing the total to 526. That represents a 30% increase in just one year, and a doubling in just two years. And that doesn\u2019t even include the spaces it has in department stores like Macy\u2019s M and Nordstrom JWN\n\nThe comparable sales declines suggest that Kors\u2019 stores are eating into each others\u2019 sales.\n\nThe Kors strategy contrasts with that of Coach. Seeking to regain the aura of luxury it squandered by having too many new stores and relying too much on outlets, Coach is closing 20% of its North American stores to better focus on locations in key markets and its flagship stores, rather than those in malls. It is also laying off its logo-centric merchandise and focusing on the higher end.\n\nKors, which also sells shoes, eyewear, watches, jewelry and fragrances, has several brands to cater to the high end, the middle market, and discount outlet shoppers, the latter of which could end up cannibalizing its pricier items and damaging its luxury aura. (Again, just look at Coach.)\n\nThat very omnipresence is starting to damage the Kors brand, experts say.\n\nAs Rahul Sharma, founder of London-based Neev Capital and a retail expert, put it in a tweet this morning: \u201cIf your marketing strategy is largely based around [the] \u2018jetset\u2019 loving younger female shopper, remember she can be rather fickle.\u201d\n\nAnd Kors\u2019 problems look set to continue: The company forecast \u201cdouble-digit\u201d percentage decreases in comparable sales this quarter, suggesting things are getting worse for the company, whose operating profit as a percentage of sales is declining.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company\u2019s inventory is up 21.8%, with overall sales rising only 17.8% (Kors\u2019 international push explains much of that growth), suggesting another renewed sales shortfall will mean more sold at clearance, further hurting its profit margins.\n\nAnalysts for years have been saying Kors should slow its growth. But shares rose five-fold from $20 in its IPO in 2011 to $100 in the past year, making it tempting to push ahead.\n\n\u201cThe seductive thing about the Kors-type of \u2018hot\u2019 trajectory is in the initial delight of consumers,\u201d veteran retail expert Robin Lewis said in an April blog post, referring to how accessible the brand is and how much people want it.\n\nThen, \u201call of a sudden, in a nano-split second, the largely young and trend-fickle consumer base wakes up and realizes the brand is slapped on everything and is being worn by everybody, everywhere. And, crash! Wonderful becomes awful. The brand stands for nothing for anybody \u2013 everywhere.\u201d\n\nThat is something that Kors, like Juicy Couture, Tommy Hilfiger, Coach and countless others before it, is now learning.",
        "generated": "Michael Kors' aggressive expansion and diversification strategy has led to brand fatigue, resulting in a 5.8% decline in comparable sales, a 6.7% drop in North America, and a 21.8% increase in inventory, leading to concerns about the brand's luxury image and profit margins.",

In 2002, when the Human Rights Campaign compiled its first Corporate Equality Index tracking company policies of concern to the LGBT community, only 13 large U.S. employers earned a perfect score \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company was one of them. That figure has now climbed to a record 366, out of the 781 companies surveyed.\n\nBut the push for equality in the workplace includes plenty of unfinished business. For example, just one-third of the Fortune 500 earned a \"perfect\" 100-point rating.\n\nRead MoreOpinion: Gay marriage's big benefit is Social Security\n\nWhile it's hard to believe, there are still places in the U.S. where someone can be fired for being \"out\" at work. As business leaders, we have a responsibility to end this kind of discrimination. Even where there are legal protections in place, many people still don't feel safe to be who they are at work. They worry they will be thought less of, won't fit in, or will be passed up for promotion.\n\nThat's not only wrong, it's bad for business. From a human- resources perspective, employee engagement is critical, as it indicates how committed employees are to the success of their company. So it should come as no surprise that, when employees feel they need to cover or hide who they are at work, it undermines their engagement and overall job satisfaction.\n\nCompanies also compete for talent. In the San Francisco Bay Area, where we're headquartered, the competition can be fierce. We find that millennials in particular, whether LGBT or not, want to work for forward-looking companies with progressive policies. And equality is a threshold issue for them.\n\nAt PG&E, diversity and inclusion have long been top priorities. It starts with policies and practices. For years, our company has provided full benefits for domestic partners. We were the first utility in to oppose Proposition 8, a 2008 California ballot initiative aimed at precluding same-sex marriage.

Recently, our executive leaders have been part of the \"I'm an Ally\" campaign to support LGBT inclusion. And on Sunday, many of them marched side-by-side with employees in this year's San Francisco Pride Parade. That's powerful.\n\nWe do these things because creating a culture of inclusion makes us a better company. Because we know we're building relationships that produce economic and social value in our communities. Because we believe companies like PG&E have a responsibility to lead by example.\n\nWe cannot afford to let this historic moment lull us into complacency.

Taking into account income, investments, retirement plans, pensions, etc. as of 2013, a white household's wealth was nearly 13 times higher than a minority household's \u2014 and that gap is growing! To put this in more tangible terms: From 2010 to 2013, the median wealth of white households increased from $138,600 to $141,900, or increased by 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, the median wealth of black households fell 33.7 percent, from $16,600 in 2010 to $11,000 in 2013. These are numbers I might expect to see in Third World countries, but not in the world's most thriving democracy. When put into the larger societal context, it's no surprise that racial tension exists in midst of this tumultuous economic conditions.\n\nRead More Obama to Expand Overtime Pay to Nearly 5 Million Workers\n\nWhat can we do to help close the wealth gap and create equal financial opportunities for minority Americans? We can focus on fair capitalism while investing in improving educational opportunities for our lower-income citizens. Providing free admission to trade schools and community colleges in order to build a more educated workforce is a great way to bridge that gap. With increased education comes more access to middle- and upper-management jobs, which can encourage investment and retirement savings for struggling minorities. A Tennessee initiative (Drive to 55) offers free education to all resident adults at any of its 27 state institutions. This is having positive impacts on the Tennessee economy and even presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has recently proposed a bill titled The College for All Act in an effort to make free education a nation-wide phenomenon.\n\nCapitalism is the only solution to our wealth inequalities in America. Fair and just practices of capitalism while maintaining principles of social empowerment don't happen by chance, half-measures or handouts. The byproducts of fair capitalism are competition, accountability and opportunity. Unfortunately, some of our nation's entitlement programs are not allies to capitalism. The problems with many of our welfare programs, which are aimed to assist much of our lower-income citizens, is not the program itself, but rather the lack of capitalistic ideals within them.\n\nRead MoreConsumer spending rises most in nearly six years\n\nReceiving public assistance should be a safety net that helps people get back on their feet \u2014 not a lifestyle. Welfare-recipient programs should include and mandate educational programs and job training. If anyone fails to comply with these government-funded programs, then they should lose some or all of their entitlement. These ideals may come across as a bit harsh, but tax money should be used to empower people if they are physically and mentally able to work. This is accountability. Once this is accomplished, it would hopefully directly lead to people becoming more competitive in the workplace.\n\nAs long as such a disproportionate number of our minorities are living in poverty, we will continue to see the inequality that provokes acts of discrimination and racism. If we really want to reach a post-racism America, we need to start closing this wealth gap and using fair capitalist ideals to focus on opportunities for EVERY American. This takes a solution based approach that may require states, municipalities, and local governments to redefine their history and design creative solutions.\n\nCommentary by Jack Brewer, a former NFL safety who played for the Vikings, Giants, Eagles and Cardinals.

        "text": "More recently, though, we've seen the rise of new commerce models, many of which are not only sustainable in the short term, but also will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years. Their growth is driven largely by the advent of mobile and the proliferation of social media, making it easier to acquire customers than ever before. Users can tell their networks about new companies or products in real time, providing lower customer-acquisition costs if the experience is special or the pain alleviated is substantial. Buyers and sellers are also connected more efficiently than ever before as mobile becomes a magic wand for marketplaces. This not only opens up new markets that weren't previously available, but also allows entrepreneurs to expose opaque ones that had previously been dominated by incumbents.\n\nStart-ups have been executing on several models that we find exciting:\n\nMembership commerce: These companies offer customers a yearly subscription for a fixed price and in return customers get to shop at heavily discounted prices. In the offline world, this was a model made popular by Costco, but leveraging economies of scale on the Internet allows startups to offer even more heavily discounted prices. Popular companies in the space range from Jet.com, which offers club price savings on a wide catalog of goods competing with Amazon, to Thrive Market, a company that marries healthy and organic products with heavy discounts (think Whole Foods meets Costco).\n\nRead MoreSilicon Valley goes after Wall Street in financial services technology\n\nSubscription commerce: This category has been around longer than membership commerce, but companies in the space continue to flourish. According to Retention Science, an e-commerce marketing platform, subscription-commerce customers are more likely to make a repeat purchase and have a higher average number of orders in a 12-month period than traditional retailers and flash sale companies. Some companies in the space include Dollar Shave Club and Harrys (razors), Trunk Club (men's clothing), Stich Fix (women's clothing), Birchbox (beauty), Lola (tampons) and Barkbox (products for your dog). By offering a product each month to consumers, there is monthly recurring revenue with this model that makes for a strong business, provided there is value being delivered every month.\n\nDirect to consumer: Many of these companies have been born out of the \"black box\" of traditional industry whereas legacy companies had significant margin due to industry monopolies and other dynamics that kept prices high unless you were willing to sacrifice quality. Warby Parker is the most notable of these companies. Warby's key innovation was the disintermediation of incumbents which gave them the ability to pass the savings to the customer. But others in the space include The Honest Company (bath & body care), Casper (mattresses), Cotopaxi (outdoor gear), Stowaway (cosmetics), Away (luggage), Harrys (razors), Campaign (furniture), Greats (sneakers), Bonobos (clothing), Naja (bras), and Everlane (clothing). Building a brand is not easy task, but modern commerce, social, and media has leveled the playing field for emerging companies.\n\nPeer-to-Peer: This model has been around for a long time, beginning with eBay and Craigslist, but both companies have left certain categories open for innovation. By owning the entire stack including logistics, quality control and photography, startups have been able to provide a better customer experience than their predecessors. Poshmark (women's fashion), Move Loot (furniture), Threadflip (women's clothes), The RealReal (luxury), ReBagg (handbags), Slang (sneakers), Grailed (menswear), TrueFacet (watches), 1st Dibs (rare objects), and ThredUP (all fashion) are all companies operating in this space. More recently, this model has also gone further upstream with companies like OpenDoor (homes) and Beepi (cars). eBay still controls much of this market, but time will tell whether or not these companies will take a large portion of the pie.\n\nRental commerce: This category was opened up by Rent the Runway but there are other interesting companies in the space as well. The Black Tux provides tuxedo rentals online, Le Tote offers women's garments and accessories on a monthly basis, and Eleven James provides luxury watch rentals for men. This category can be more limiting, as quality control is more difficult and the use case doesn't span a wide variety of categories; nonetheless, existing companies in the space have seen strong growth and traction.\n\nRead More Value retailers to post better earnings: Analyst\n\nAs you can see, it's an exciting time to be investing in commerce companies. As the barrier to entry for these companies is reduced, more and more interesting companies and models will be born. In the midst of this sea of new companies and models, it can often be difficult to discern which will be winners.\n\nOne of the key things that we look for when investing in these companies is the potential strength of the brand. The most successful commerce companies have been able to build a strong brand that resonates with their customers. These \"lifestyle\" brands include the Honest Company, Gilt, and Warby Parker, which all have distinct brand identities. People that shop at the Honest Company care about their children and the environment deeply. Gilt customers are aspirational, wanting to live a more glamorous lifestyle in the mold of GQ. Warby Parker has built glamorous showrooms with more foot traffic than just about any other store with the exception of the Apple Store.\n\nRead MoreOut with luxury retail, in with off-price: Analyst\n\nYet, it's important take heed of a recent shift in ecommerce toward opening up select, strategic bricks-and-mortar locations. Rent the Runway, Birchbox, and Warby Parker have all established physical locations in response to requests from their customers. After all, with ecommerce conversion rates no higher than about 5 percent, these companies have found a way to activate the other 95 percent of their traffic. While it is not an effective strategy for all ecommerce retailers, establishing tactical offline channels has proven successful for a handful of the winners.
