Currently, a total of 215,462 licences exist in New South Wales compared to the 177,675 owned in 2010.

Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'.

The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the \"smart bullets\" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman \"repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,\" a DARPA statement said. \"Additionally,\" the statement said, \"a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target.\" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. \"True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,\" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. \"This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,\" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.",

Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite. Another exile, Sofia Bocian, told Lazar how her brother escaped their prison camp, leaving her with the horrifying experience of being interrogated by Soviet secret police.

Now that they're in their 80s, time is running out for them to document their struggles. Look at Lazar's images. The faces fill each frame. Each portrait is unique.

Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday:\u00a0Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

Horiguchi was dangerous in the opening round, as his blend of unorthodox, karate-based movements and impressive speed gave the champ some pause in the early going.

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said.

Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . Sterling's decision to hold his now infamous BBC interview without Liverpool's permission is said to have surprised those at north London. Likewise, the fact he has been caught smoking shisha and inhaling nitrous oxide has not gone down well at Arsenal. And the FA Cup holders are now having second thoughts over their interest in the England international fearing similar scenarios could tarnish the club's reputation.

The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family's lawsuit trying to block the Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes. The lawsuit brought by Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their two children claimed the school district's yoga classes promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Scroll down for video . Students hold their positions during a yoga class at Capri Elementary School in Encinitas, California, in 2012 . A California appeals court ruled yoga classes taught at Capri do not violate students' right to religious freedom . The court upheld the previous ruling in a 3-0 opinion. The district court wrote: 'While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are, as the trial court determined, \"devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings.\" 'We conclude that the program is secular in purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and does not excessively entangle the school district in religion. 'The district's yoga program does not violate our state constitution.' The First Amendment bans school-sponsored religious promotion and prayer. Yoga instructor Kristen McCloskey (right) leads third graders at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in 2012 . The Sedlocks were disappointed with the ruling and are considering their options. Attorney Dean Broyles said: 'No other court in the past 50 years has allowed public school officials to lead children in formal religious rituals like the Hindu liturgy of praying to, bowing to, and worshipping the sun god.' A school distort lawyer said there were no rituals occurring in the classroom and no one was worshipping the sun or leading Hindu rites. The district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength, flexibility and balance. Yoga is now taught at schools across the country, but the district is believed to be the first with full-time yoga teachers at all schools. A three-year grant from the K.P. Jois Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes Ashtanga yoga, provides twice-weekly, 30-minute classes to the district's 5,600 students.

Raid: One of two robbers who used a sledgehammer and an axe to try and break in to a jewellery shop . The attempted break-in took place in Pemberton, a suburb of Wigan in Greater Manchester, on Saturday afternoon. One of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at Uncle Jewellers and Pawn Brokers. When a worker barricaded the door and pushed one of them back through the broken window they fled the scene, threatening a member of the public with the axe as they did so. Greater Manchester Police are now investigating whether the incident is linked to a similar break-in at another Wigan jeweller last week, which also involved a motorbike and a sledgehammer. Getaway: The two criminals used motorbikes to escape from the scene in Wigan, Greater Manchester . Detective Sergeant Pete Carletti said: 'This attempted robbery happened in broad daylight on a busy Saturday afternoon in Pemberton town centre. 'It caused a lot of commotion and I have no doubt there are lots of potential witnesses who saw what happened and could have vital information for us. 'We have obtained a large number of names of members of the public present in the area at the relevant time but I would ask for those people who have not yet spoken to police to contact us. 'The shop worker showed incredible bravery in the face of adversity to hold these two thieves back and I would like to commend them for their actions. Vehicle: One of the motorcycles used by the raiders, who were caught on camera by a bystander . 'I would also like to thank the member of the public who was brave enough to take photos of the offenders, although we would obviously never advise people to put themselves in danger to do so in any similar situation. 'We now need to find those responsible so I would again urge anyone who witnessed this appalling attempted robbery to come forward.' Anyone with information about the raid should call police on 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",

Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson\u2019s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club\u2019s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson\u2019s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese\u2019s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from\u00a0Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini\u2019s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City\u2019s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford\u2019s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore.

Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals \u2013 ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it \u2013 were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: \u2018Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I\u2019ve ever seen before. \u2018I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. \u2018It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . \u2018There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.\u2019 According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera\u2019s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. \u2018I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,\u2019 he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.",

The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open . Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week . But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open. 'It is difficult to win everything all the time. Djokovic was as good then in 2011 as he is now. He had an impeccable year in 2011 as well as he is having in 2015. I have to congratulate him. Djokovic is World No 1 and in superb form, but Nadal insists he has no worries about Roland Garros . The Spaniard is looking to win a sixth consecutive French Open, and a tenth in total . 'The rest of the players have to accept that at the moment he is the world number one with all he has achieved this year,' added Nadal, who has had a patchy year after making his comeback in January following another lengthy injury and illness break. 'This year I have to do things right, get back to a very high level to face him on the court,' Nadal said. 'Tennis-wise, I feel a lot better than a few weeks ago. I am going to try to get as far as I can and to play as well as I can, topping the level I showed in Monte Carlo.' Nadal admits that Djokovic will be the man to beat, but says this year will be no different to previous ones .",

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either \u2018incredibly naive or totally incompetent\u2019 by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank\u2019s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for \u2018a further one-year period\u2019 before leaving the bank\u2019s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that \u2018no decision has been taken at this time\u2019. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: \u2018You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.\u2019 Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC\u2019s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax. The bank was subsequently fined \u00a31.2 billion for breaching American money-laundering laws. Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than \u00a3500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC\u2019s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC\u2019s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that \u2018frontline\u2019 staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank\u2019s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: \u2018We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.\u2019 But Mrs Hodge responded that to \u2018simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose\u2019. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role\u00a0over her HSBC role .

Officials from the anti-racism body say they have acted on complaints from some Hartlepool fans and urged Carlisle to refuse admission to any fans who might decide to 'black up' for the occasion. Jamaican reggae artist Marley was a multi-million-selling artist, famed for his music and as a Rastafarian for his dreadlocked look, who died of cancer aged 36 in 1981. Hartlepool United fans have a history of fancy dress, travelling as the Smurfs to Charlton in 2012 . Hartlepool fans are planning to dress up as Bob Marley for the final game of this season at Carlisle . A statement from Kick It Out read: 'We have received a number of complaints from Hartlepool United supporters about the Bob Marley fancy dress theme planned by a group of the club's fans for their fixture against Carlisle United at Brunton Park on Saturday 2 May. 'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence. 'We have provided guidance to both clubs on the matter, and advised Carlisle United of our own stance that if any fans do choose to 'black up' they should be refused entry to their stadium. Kick It Out have urged Carlisle to refuse entry to any fans who decide to black up for the fixture . 'We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have received from Hartlepool United supporters. 'If we do receive complaints informing us that supporters have 'blacked up' at the fixture between Carlisle United and Hartlepool United, or that any incidents or disturbances of a discriminatory nature have occurred, we will follow our usual procedures by making the Football Association and the Football League aware for them to investigate.' Neither Carlisle nor Hartlepool were immediately available for comment but Carlisle boss Keith Curle told the local News & Star at a press conference this week: 'I've been to fancy dress parties when white people have dressed up as Bob Marley.

Ozil was off the pace at the beginning of this season, but says he is now back to his best since returning to fitness in January. And the German star says his injury has actually helped him, claiming that it 'worked in my favour' after a busy schedule. Mesut Ozil trains ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi final against Reading on Saturday . The German star says he is now playing his best football since joining the Gunners in the summer of 2013 . Ozil said 10 years of playing football had taken their toll, but he has come to terms with the Premier League . Mesut Ozil is interviewed in this week's Sport . 'At the moment I am pleased with the consistency of my game,' Ozil told Sport magazine. 'I feel I am now playing my best football since joining Arsenal.' The playmaker was a big part of Germany's World Cup win over the summer, playing every game as Joachim Low's side lifted the trophy in Brazil, and the process took a lot out of him. 'I was exhausted at the start of the season,' he confesses. 'I started playing professional football at the age of 16 and had never really suffered many serious injuries. ' I guess 10 years of consistently playing football took its toll. I was also struggling with the physicality of this league.' However, Ozil has bounced back in the second half of this season, his excellent form coinciding with a winning run that has seen the Gunners climb the table. And the 26-year-old midfielder has attributed his success, in part, to the injury that kept him out for three months this winter. Ozil celebrates scoring a goal in the convincing win against Liverpool, when he was in excellent form . Ozil has put his improved performances down to the strength training he went through after being injured . 'The injury worked in my favour in a way, as it gave me time to recover, to assess and to work on what was required to compete in this league,' he added. 'The football here is far more physical, it is played at a faster tempo and you have to adapt to the sheer number of games. 'I have had to work a lot harder and adjust my game accordingly. I used my time out with injury to work on my strength. I'm continuing to do extra sessions after training now.'

QPR are just a point behind 17th-placed Sunderland . And Barton, who scored Rangers' fourth, is eyeing a late run which can take them to safety. 'We took our chances and hopefully it's a springboard for us to put a run together and make it difficult for the teams in and around the relegation zone,' he told the club's official website. 'There's a great amount of spirit in the group, a lot of people have written us off and we have an awful lot of work to do but performances like that give us a hell of a chance.

        "text": "Ferrari technical director James Allison believes Mercedes are again likely to lead the way in China this weekend. Fears of another season of domination from Mercedes were blown away by a shock, yet deserved victory for Sebastian Vettel last time out in Malaysia. It was the Maranello marque's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg will not have it all their own way. Sebastian Vettel won the second race of the season with victory in Malaysia last month . Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . In searing heat and high track temperatures the Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen were far kinder on their tyres, stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for Hamilton and Rosberg. This weekend's race at the Shanghai International Circuit, however, should favour Mercedes given the cooler climes than that of Sepang. Allison is certainly not expecting back-to-back Ferrari wins and said: 'Our car has a pretty decent cooling package. 'That allowed us to operate in the fierce temperatures like we experienced in Malaysia without having to open up the car. 'The track was also rough and hot, which is hard for tyres, and we're fortunate the car goes well on its tyres. Hamilton celebrates his win in Australia . 'Quite what problems were going on in Merc-land I don't know. 'But I'm fairly sure we will have our work cut out in China to do as impressive a job as we did in Malaysia.' As to whether Ferrari can stay the course with Mercedes and provide a season-long challenge, for now that is too difficult to determine. 'I don't know about that. I'll tell you at the end of the season,' remarked Allison with a smile. 'In Melbourne (the season-opening Australian Grand Prix) Mercedes were very, very dominant, and we were better than we looked. 'Even in free air we wouldn't have held a candle to them there. 'There is a lot of work for us to do before we can head into every race weekend confident we can hunt for the victory from the first session of that weekend. 'But we do have a fairly exciting development plan, and we've a lot of performance to bring. 'It should at least be an interesting season to see if we can close that gap so we are genuine contenders at any weekend.' Crucially, and what may yet be a determining factor, Allison added: 'Normally over the course of a season being kind to your tyres is the best thing you can be.'",

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter.

The decision to ban Hardy, who last played for the Carolina Panthers, followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games . Domestic violence charges against Hardy, who signed with Dallas last month, were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify. The jury trial for Hardy had been set to begin in Charlotte after he was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill her. The league's probe, which involved numerous interviews with witnesses and experts, concluded that Hardy violated the NFL's personal conduct policy by using physical force against Holder in at least four instances. 'The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,' Goodell wrote. 'The use of physical force under the circumstances present here, against a woman substantially smaller than you and in the presence of powerful, military-style assault weapons, constitutes a significant act of violence in violation of the Personal Conduct Policy.' Hardy arrives at Mecklenburg County jail on the first day of his domestic violence appeal trail . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, was accused of assaulting Holder last May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. The five-year NFL veteran was found guilty by a district court judge in July but appealed the verdict and was allowed to have a jury trial. Prosecutors said when Holder last spoke with them in November, she told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Holder had already reached a civil settlement with Hardy, prosecutors said. Hardy may appeal the NFL's decision within three days. 'You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,' Goodell wrote. 'In that respect, you should understand that another violation of this nature may result in your banishment from the NFL.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust\u2019s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. \u2018He noted\u2026that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,\u2019 the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. \u2018But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people \u2018tune in\u2019 in new, digital ways. \u2018[Those ways] aren\u2019t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here \u2013 like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.\u2019 BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today\u2019s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. \u2018He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,\u2019 the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC\u2019s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new \u2018digital first\u2019 strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to \u2018learn lessons\u2019 if they want to \u2018compete with organisations that were born in the digital age\u2019.",

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.",

The man posed as a member of the congregation of St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester to carry out the crime. As well as taking one bag, he tried to steal the contents of two other elderly women's bags before fleeing. Police have released an e-fit and CCTV footage after a thief stole a pensioner's handbag from a church . The thief sat down in a pew next to the 86-year-old for the Good Friday service earlier this month. After grabbing the bag, he targeted an 82-year-old woman but she was alerted when she heard him rustling in her purse. As he fled the church, the thief tried to snatch the handbag from a third woman, also aged 86. But instinctively the woman pushed the thief away as he tried to pull the bag from her shoulder and he ran off. Police have described the incident on April 3 as 'appalling' and have released an e-fit image of the suspected offender. They are appealing to anyone who recognises him to come forward. The thief is described as being a white man, in his 40s of a medium build and wearing a grey hooded top. The incident happened at\u00a0St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester on April 3 . Det Con Dave Bennett of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The actions of this underhand and sneaky thief are so shocking that I have no doubt people who live in this area, particularly those who worship at this church, will be very angry. 'He used an important date in the religious calendar and within the sanctity of the church grounds to target elderly women who had simply gone to the church to mark Good Friday.' He added: 'Not only did he pinch one woman's bag, but he also tried to steal two other handbags and was only stopped in his tracks thanks to the vigilance of two of the women. 'It is a sinister, cowardly and disrespectful crime and we need to find the man responsible before he can target anyone else, whether they will elderly people or those attending at the church. 'We have released an accurate likeness of this offender and I would urge people to look very carefully at the image. If you recognise who this man is then please do the right thing and call us.

It was given as a gift to two sisters who worked as servants for the Nightingale family at Lea Hurst, near Matlock, Derbyshire. Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night. The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants' family. Auctineer Charles Hanson said: \u2018The lamp is quite remarkable. It has a wonderful provenance, which confirms it helped ignite Florence and her writings late into many a Derbyshire night. 'Such an iconic object and it\u2019s association with such a leading lady will be guided at \u00a31000-2000. With interest and competition it may just ignite, since it is such a wonderful object.'

The statue, which stands in a gardens in Wuhan, the capital city of central China\u2019s Hubei Province, is to honour Yu The Great, who founded China's first dynasty in 2070 BC. Officials in\u00a0Wuhan, the capital city of central China\u2019s Hubei Province, have accused tourists of damaging a statue of the country's first leader and his wife by fondling the woman's exposed breast . The sculpture, which has been in place for ten years, depicts Yu The Great, the founder of China's first Xia Dynasty in 2070 BC, meeting his wife . Legend says that Yu and his wife were brought together by a nine-tailed fox that lead them to one another . The bronze tells the story of how the leader met his wife, after the couple were supposedly brought together by a mythical nine-tailed fox. Over the decade that the statue has been in place, people have been touching the hand of Yu The Great, the fox's back, and wife's chest. While the rest of the statue is black, the colour of the coating applied to protect the metal, the parts that have been touched have worn away to expose the metal underneath. Over the years tourists have kept touching Yu's hand, the fox's back, and his wife's exposed breast - leading to them becoming worn . While the rest of the metallic sculpture is black, the colour of the protective layer which coats the statue, the fox, hand and breast have become worn, exposing the metal underneath . Locals accuse tourists of having a lack of respect for culture, but admit the behaviour is unlikey to change . Yu the Great is thought to have lived between 2,200\u20132,100 BCE, and is credited with uniting the nine early provinces of China. While little is known about his rule, as his predates the earliest written records by nearly a millennium, he is credited with building an immense system of flood defences in central China. These helped to bring prosperity and stability to the volatile region, and so impressed another emperor that he named Yu as his heir, rather than his own son.",

The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of \u00a312million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches.

And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy.

Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now. 'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage. Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches . 'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself. 'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason. So one only plays when he deserves to play. 'We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities,' Mancini added. The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary . 'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play. 'Inter could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this. I am sure that Shaqiri next season will achieve great things.'",

The 2013 US Open champion ended the day on seven under, sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader Jordan Spieth. But it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening-day 67. Rose bogeyed three of the first four holes, finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots. And that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue. He revealed: \u2018I was feeling really uncomfortable with my game, so I drew a line on my scorecard at that point, like you draw a line in the sand. Justin Rose battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at Augusta . Rose tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third, seven shots behind runaway leader Jordan Spieth . Rose flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the Englishman . \u2018I told myself to move on and take one shot at a time. I made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me, and after that I played with the same rhythm as the first day.\u2019 The dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes, putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times. And 34-year-old Rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend. He said: \u2018I\u2019m starting seven back and Jordan has played beautifully so far, but we all know a lot can happen. There\u2019s magic out there on this course and it\u2019s up to me to make something special happen.\u2019 Maybe Ian Poulter could borrow Rose\u2019s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn\u2019t get going. He was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament. He said on Twitter: \u2018Really disappointed. It\u2019s simply unacceptable and disgraceful putting \u2014 34 putts for level par is pathetic.\u2019 Earlier, 19-year-old Scot Bradley Neil had a tough day, shooting a 79 and finishing 13 over.

Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: \u2018Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters \u2014 any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.\u2019 The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

The magistrate had ordered Cousins to produce written evidence of the conflicting appointments before 4pm WST or an arrest warrant would be issued. Scroll down for video .

The 2005 Brownlow medallist was arrested on March 11 after allegedly leading police on a low speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park. He was charged with reckless driving, failing to stop and refusing a breath test. Cousins has twice been hospitalised for mental health assessments following that incvident - the first time after he breached security at an SAS base in Swanbourne. The second time followed seemingly bizarre behaviour in Canning Vale, including climbing on the roof of a house. The former West Coast Eagles captain has not been charged over those incidents. Cousins retired from the AFL in 2010. He was arrested on March 11 after police saw him driving erratically in Bicton and was eventually caught several suburbs away in Mosman Park .

According to scientists, sugar consumption can suppress the hormone cortisol, which is released into the body when we are experiencing stress. Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40. Half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast, lunch and dinner over 12 days, while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame. The volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks, including fruit juice, outside these times. Before and after the study period, the women were given a difficult maths test and then underwent MRI scans to measure the response of their brains to stress. Saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol, which is made by the adrenal glands. The women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks. Dr Kevin Laugero, one of the researchers at the University of California, Davis, said: \u2018This is the first evidence that high sugar consumption \u2013 but not aspartame \u2013 may relieve stress in humans.\u2019 Finding: Scientists at the University of California, Davis (above) said the women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks . However, while research shows sugary drinks can help to dull feelings of anxiety, experts warn that too many of them could be habit-forming \u2013 and may explain the desire to comfort eat under pressure. Dr Laugero, whose findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, warned that chronic stress could prompt people to make a habit of consuming too much sugar, which is not recommended due to its links to health problems. He said: \u2018The concern is that psychological or emotional stress could trigger the habitual overconsumption of sugar and amplify sugar\u2019s detrimental health effects, including obesity.\u2019 In the US, more than a third of adults and about a sixth of children are obese, with sugar-laden fizzy drinks and fruit juice partly to blame. Around half of the American population consume sugary drinks on any given day. Dr Laugero added: \u2018The results suggest differences in dietary habits may explain why some people under-react to stressful situations and others over-react. \u2018Although it may be tempting to suppress feelings of stress, a normal reaction to stress is important to good health.\u2019",

Police were called after Kenneth Crowder, 41, was seen by a witness on Friday running naked through a neighborhood calling himself God. He was also spotted committing an undisclosed sex act on a tree. Crowder\u00a0was arrested in Melbourne, facing charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer. Kennth Crowder was arrested in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday after being spotted running naked through a neighborhood claiming he was God . When police arrived on scene, he had put on jeans and a T-shirt and walked toward the officer in an aggressive manner as he called himself God, police told\u00a0WKMG. A police officer shocked him with a Taser twice, but each time he pulled the probes out of his body and attempted to fight the officer. The officer then punched Crowder in the face and he fought back, claiming he was Thor and attempting to stab the officer with his own police badge. More officers eventually came to the scene and helped handcuff and shackle Crowder. He was booked into Brevard County Jail Complex and later posted bond to be released. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances like marijuana, is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP. That's the synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone, the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Crowder was arrested on charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer . Flakka resembles a mix of crack cocaine and meth and it has a noticeably foul smell, according to WPBF 25 News. Once ingested, the drug causes a feeling of euphoria, hallucinations and sometimes psychosis or apparent superhuman strength. The high lasts for a couple hours and users are left with a strong desire to use again. Users have nicknamed the drug '$5 insanity' because hits often cost less than $10, according to the Sun-Sentinel. There were more than 670 Flakka occurrences in Florida in 2014, up from 85 in 2012 and zero in 2010, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.",

        "text": "(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are \"conscientious objectors,\" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new \"no jab, no pay\" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. \"The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,\" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. \"It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,\" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.",

Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock ruled out several causes for a 56-year-old man's kidney problems before blaming the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily. Black tea has high levels of oxalate, a chemical known to produce kidney stones and even lead to kidney failure if consumed in excessive doses. Scroll down for video . Toxic tea: Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock blamed a 56-year-old man's kidney problems on the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily . 'It was the only reasonable explanation,' said Dr Umbar Ghaffar of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who wrote about the patient in an article for the New England Journal of Medicine. The man was admitted to the hospital in May complaining of nausea, weakness, fatigue and body aches. The chemical oxalate was found to have clogged the man's kidneys, to the point that they had become inflamed. With a habit of drinking about 16 8-ounce cups of iced tea every day, the unidentified man was consuming anywhere from 3 to 10 times the amount an average American takes in. The 16-daily-cups habit was striking on its own, since federal studies have found that the average US adult drinks about 10 to 11 cups of liquid every day, including water, coffee and other beverages. Ghaffar said she didn't know whether the man was drinking sweet tea, a concoction made from black tea and a hefty serving of sugar that is popular in the South, though he was diabetic. The New England Journal of Medicine has cited black tea in health issues before, publishing a 2013 case that found a 47-year-old woman had developed a bone disease from drinking a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 bags of tea every day. The Arkansas man's case, however, does not suggest health risks for most people, according to Dr Randy Luciano, a Yale School of Medicine kidney specialist. 'I wouldn't tell people to stop drinking tea,' said Luciano, who has treated patients with oxalate-related kidney damage. That man drank 'a lot of tea.'",

Celebrity favourite: It has emerged that Cetaphil is responsible for the glowing skin of a host of stars including Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden (left) and actresses Charlize Theron (right) and Olivia Wilde . Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, which currently costs \u00a36.74 at Boots and is also stocked in pharmacies such as Lloyds and online on Amazon, is fragrance and soap free and contains just eight ingredients, which makes it less harsh on the skin than other facewashes containing long lists of chemicals.

Fragrance free:\u00a0Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser . And yesterday Miss Holden, 44, revealed that it is her secret to remaining fresh-faced. \u2018I swear by Cetaphil. 'It isn\u2019t fancy or expensive but it does what I need it to do,\u2019 she said. The mother of two girls said she had started looking into ways to improve her skin after playing Princess Fiona in Shrek in the West End in 2011, which meant wearing heavy green make-up each night. She said she used to have botox injections and plastic surgery but that nearly dying giving birth to her daughter Hollie in 2012 put her off any more invasive treatments. She now relies on radio frequency energy facials (as well as more budget-friendly products such as Cetaphil) to hold back the years. Rush actress Miss Wilde, 31, has described Cetaphil as \u2018the best\u2019 facial cleanser, while Monster star Miss Theron, 39, said she loves the \u2018clean smell\u2019.

And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.",

A Texan and lover of the female form asked the state department to provide him with this license plate . Those banned include 'I [heart] BOOBS', 'BAD AX' and 'JLOBUT' - presumably a reference to singer and actress Jennifer Lopez's ample behind. More than 120,000 personalized number plates have been issued by the Texan Department for Motor Vehicles, which can last up to 10 years before the driver has to re-apply. Perhaps wishful thinking was behind this idea for a license plate - also rejected by the Texas state department . Jennifer Lopez topped the charts with her song 'Booty', but probably didn't think her bottom would be put on the back side of a car. The application for this license plate was also rejected by the Texas DMV .",

Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at \u00a335m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at \u00a335million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani.

The midfielder was sent off for two bookings in the 2-0 defeat at Liverpool Sunday night, but he could've seen a straight red after he caught Lucas on the ankle. The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Moussa Sissoko lunges in and makes a terrible tackle on Liverpool midfielder Lucas . The 25-year-old was sent off for a second bookable offence during Newcastle's defeat at Anfield . Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, pulling no punches. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.'

I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. Sissoko is given his marching orders by referee Lee Mason after picking up two yellow cards . He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough.

Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records. Because he was under 18 when the crime was committed, he is not eligible for the death penalty. He'll be formally sentenced in June. The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Jones, who was 17 at the time of the murder, will be eligible for parole starting in 2051, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO. He will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact. Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told Australian radio station 3AW that when police arrested the teens, Jones offered a motive that made clear that Lane, a baseball player on scholarship, was chosen at random. \"We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.\" After the verdict, Luna appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs, whimpering  \"I'm sorry\"  to a reporter.

At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all.

A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. \"We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,\" Mainzer wrote.",

Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Historian David Starkey (pictured) says ethnic minority groups and disabled people should not 'assume the status of victim' In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Telegraph, he hit out at Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of race murder victim Stephen, for following what he claimed was the approach of US civil rights leaders after Martin Luther King's death by 'treating blacks as victims'.

It's catastrophic.' Starkey, who said he was 'born quite seriously disabled', added people with physical and mental disabilities should not be portrayed as victims. And he claimed fears of Islamophobia were victimising Muslims, making them 'therefore somehow privileged and exempt'.

A smuggler in the Libyan capital of Tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees, during a conversation that a CNN producer secretly filmed. The conversation, recorded using a mobile phone, exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships. An estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but still more wait to try to reach Europe. CNN's producer was introduced to a Senegalese and Malian smuggler by an intermediary in Tripoli, who mistakenly thought she was a Syrian looking to bring other Syrian refugees with her onto boats to Italy. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories . The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of Tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the \"final price\" for Syrians -- often thought to be richer than their African migrant counterparts -- was $1,000. He added that for each Syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the \"discount\" was \"well known,\" suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat. Any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors, and that the Senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and GPS to assist the crossing. He also assured CNN's producer, when asked, that if the people became too many, they would use two boats. Pregnant women among migrants trying to cross .",

The Premier League table after Arsenal had played 31 games in 2013/14 (left), and now (right) Played 31, won 19, drawn six, lost six - the only stat differentiating the two tables is Arsenal's favourable goal difference in this campaign - a season which their points tally of 63 merits a place of second, rather than fourth. With the addition of Alexis Sanchez as well as a new-found solidity in Francis Coquelin and the goalscoring returns of Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil, the Gunners are already being tipped to challenge for the title next season. But the run of form at the start of the season - in contrast to 2013/14 when they impressed in the opening months - has cost Wenger. Defeats by Swansea, Stoke and Manchester United will be looked back on with regret by this Arsenal team, as well as dropping points late on at Liverpool and Tottenham. Mathieu Flamini celebrates after equalising in Arsenal's 31st game last season against Manchester City . The Gunners were in fine form at the beginning of the 2013/14 season and topped the table for many weeks . They currently top the European form guide but still can't beat their efforts from last year, at this stage at least. Wind back a year and Arsenal were reeling from a 6-0 defeat by Chelsea, drawing with Swansea and Manchester City before another humiliating loss at the hands of Everton. Things are certainly on the up for the Gunners now and they do look in fine shape heading into the summer, but they should not forget what could have been, this season and last. Arsene Wenger will regret many results in this season - including a 3-2 defeat by Stoke City in December .",

The family of tragic ski boy Carwyn Scott-Howell were expected to bring his body home this weekend as an investigation into his death ruled out negligence as a factor. Carwyn, seven, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France, while skiing with his mother Ceri and siblings Gerwyn and Antonia, after becoming separated from them. According to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau, the schoolboy\u2019s death earlier this month was \u2018a tragic accident\u2019 with no one to blame. The family, from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, were enjoying their last run of the holiday when Antonia fell and her mother stopped to help. Carwyn carried on skiing and then ventured into a wooded area. His mother thought he had continued to their accommodation but raised the alarm when he did not return. Mr Michau said: \u2018The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste. The reason why is not known but it was by error. \u2018Had he been with someone bigger or older, the accident wouldn\u2019t have happened but it remains a dramatic and tragic accident.\u2019 In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. ' Carwyn, seven, \u00a0from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France .",

Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. \"This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,\" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. \"It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts.\" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said.
