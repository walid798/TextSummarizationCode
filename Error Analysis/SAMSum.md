## Error Analysis for SAMSum Summaries
Our analysis of the generated SAMSum summaries reveals these recurring challenges:

## Omission of Contextual Details:
In many cases, important context is lost. For instance, in docID: 13830023, the generated summary mentions the carnival party and basic details (e.g., five bouncy castles, a big bouncy dragon) but does not reflect the excitement and additional context provided by the participants. Similarly, in docID: 13727853, the nuanced emotional content and intensity of the conversation about relationship issues are reduced to a simpler narrative.

## Generic Representation of Dialogue Dynamics:
While the generated summaries effectively summarize the primary events—such as identifying that Ian is looking for his green folder (docID: 13830056) or that Gab wants to meet Kat (docID: 13729708)—they often fail to capture the back-and-forth dynamics and the interpersonal cues (e.g., humor, reluctance, or enthusiasm) that provide a richer understanding of the interaction.

## Inconsistent Detail Retention:
Some examples, like the brief conversation in docID: 13809969 or docID: 13681082, are summarized accurately in terms of content. However, even in these cases, the nuances of tone and emotional inflection are underrepresented, resulting in summaries that are factually correct but stylistically flat.

As a conclusion, important contextual details found in the original dialogues are frequently left out of the reference summaries in the SAMSum dataset which are notably brief. Our LLM-generated summaries on the other hand include not only the essential information but also the interpersonal dynamics and nuanced contextual clues that enhance comprehension of the discussion.
