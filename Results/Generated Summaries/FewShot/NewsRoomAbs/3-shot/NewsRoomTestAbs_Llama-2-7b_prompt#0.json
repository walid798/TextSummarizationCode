        "text": "It\u2019s back-to-school season, so it\u2019s worth asking which top universities offer their female students the best springboard to a powerful position at the top of their own company?\n\nOver the past five years, 40 women with undergraduate degrees from Stanford University have received venture capital funding for companies they founded, more than any other top school, according to data from Pitchbook, which provides research to private equity and venture capital firms. Among the companies founded by Stanford alums receiving venture capital funding in recent years is flash-sale style home decor website One Kings Lane, which was founded by Stanford grad Susan Feldman along with Alison Pincus, the wife of Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus. Another Stanford grad, Clara Shih \u2014 a former Fortune \u201c40 Under 40\u2033 member who also serves on Starbucks\u2019 board \u2014 co-founded social media marketing management service Hearsay Social with former Microsoft engineer Steve Garrity.\n\nWhen it comes to MBA programs, Harvard tops the list with 56 female founders receiving funding over the past five years. Companies springing up recently that are led by female Harvard MBA\u2019s include beauty and grooming products delivery service Birchbox, founded by Harvard MBAs Hayley Barna and Katia Beauchamp, which recently raised $60 million in a Series B funding. Another company on the list is personal styling for women website Stitch Fix, which was founded in 2011 by Katrina Lake, who actually has degrees from both Stanford and Harvard.\n\nHarvard also came in third on the list of undergraduate programs with 29 female-founder alums dating back to 2009, finishing behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its 31 female founders during that same period. MIT finished third on Pitchbook\u2019s list of MBA programs with female alums receiving VC funding over the past five years. MIT had 23 during that period, behind Stanford\u2019s 31.\n\nOf course, those three schools aren\u2019t just churning out female entrepreneurs. Stanford, Harvard and MIT also placed in the top five (for both undergraduates and MBAs) in a separate Pitchbook list ranking schools by the number of company founders of all genders that they produced. That the schools fared well on both lists \u2014 again, Stanford topped the undergraduate list, while Harvard\u2019s MBA program topped its list \u2014 shows that these top schools are simply consistently producing successfully entrepreneurial graduates of all genders.\n\n\u201cA lot of the undergraduates [at these schools] have been heavily focusing on computer science and engineering, especially in the past decade or so. It makes sense, since those schools are producing those types of degree holders, that both male and female graduates would be the ones creating these products and companies,\u201d said Andy White, a Pitchbook analyst.\n\nHowever, even the top schools on the Pitchbook list are seeing a large disparity between the number of female founders they graduate and the total number of company founders spawned by each school. For instance, Stanford may lead the way with 40 female founders over the past five years, but that group accounts for less than 11% of the total number (378) of Stanford alums to receive VC funding for their companies in that period. Similarly, female founders account for only about 16% of the 352 total company founders with Harvard MBAs from that same time period.\n\nWhite says he expects the gap between female and male company founders to narrow over time, though, and he even points to a Pitchbook study from last year showing that companies with at least one female founder have increased their share of VC funding rounds in each of the previous 10 years. Those numbers showed female-founded companies more than tripled their share of U.S. venture rounds during that time, rising to 13% last year.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot more money flowing into those companies founded by women and I can only see that increasing,\u201d White said.",

He's a former two-division champion as a professional. But all anyone wants to talk about with \"JuanMa\" is how entertaining he is in the ring. One of his bouts hasn't gone to a decision since 2009 -- a pretty ridiculous feat considering the competition level he has faced.\n\nIn all, Lopez, 31, has only gone the distance three times in his nine-year pro career. Of his 34 wins, 31 have come by way of knockout. But Lopez is concerned that's all he'll be remembered for.\n\n\"When I retire, I want people to talk about how good I was, not just how exciting I was,\" Lopez told FOX Sports.\n\nIt's for that reason you might see a more conservative \"JuanMa\" against Jesus Cuellar on Thursday night at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas (FOX Sports 1, 9:30 p.m. ET) -- at least as conservative as Lopez can possibly get. He is coming off a loss to Fernando Vargas in July and admitted to contemplating retirement. When this co-main event fight came up, though, it was too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\n\"This is very, very important,\" Lopez (34-4) said. \"Probably the most important of my career. I can't afford a loss. This fight here gets me into the bigger fights down the road.\"\n\nCuellar (24-1) will come in as the favorite. He's the reigning interim WBA featherweight champion and, at 27, four years younger. In the narrative, he's the young, hungry lion trying to make his name off the more well-known boxer. It's combat sports booking 101.\n\n\"I know that this is going to be a hard fight,\" said Cuellar, an Argentinean. \"I've been training hard for it in an intense camp and I'm here to do my job and take the victory home.\"\n\nLopez has other plans. He knows with the way the sport works, he can notch just one or two wins and get right back into more marquee fights.\n\n\"Boxing is like that,\" Lopez said. \"The landscape is always changing. It's constantly changing in boxing. I know a victory here is a step in the right direction. A huge fight.\"\n\n\"JuanMa,\" though, admitted to thinking about retirement after the loss to Vargas. He has been through an incredible amount of wars. But he said he's reinvigorated by the prospect of fighting Cuellar. Lopez's body feels good and he's excited about the possibility of getting back on track.\n\n\"JuanMa\" might be known for his unabashedly crowd-pleasing style, but that's secondary Thursday night. His career -- his legacy -- comes first.\n\n\"Forget about looking good,\" he said. \"I need to win.\"",

I am an enthusiastic private collector, mainly of mid-20th-century British art; it has been one of the great joys of the past 10 years for me. But in the end, Discerning Eye needed a bit of crumpet, however old, and I suspect more people will come to see my facelift than anything else. In past years the panel has included Brian Sewell, Lord Palumbo, Lord Gowrie and the Prince of Wales.\n\nWe six selectors met on a cold, wet day last September. We were positioned behind two trestle tables in a grim basement and asked what tickled our fancies. The works, a staggering 2,400 of them, were presented to us by half a dozen quite dazzling young men, all artists themselves.\n\nThe bonus of male beauty apart, much of the art was a joy and quite often two or three of us would be trying to bag the same picture. Mark mainly wanted what I wanted. It was quite comforting to find Peter Randall-Page and Norbert Lynton wanted the same as me. And I almost never wanted anything that Mark wanted. When Mark absented himself for a couple of hours to do an interview, I helpfully chose a photograph of a fish on a women's backside on his behalf. Sadly, he was having none of it when he returned. So the lady and the trout do not appear in his list.\n\nThe exhibition opens tomorrow at the Mall Galleries in London (020-7930 6844), and of the 500 works of art on display, my collection is the largest. I've made a selection of 90, mostly by young artists. I've got a couple of installation pieces that are fantastically eclectic, by really interesting young graduates. One of my favourites is a portrait of James Lloyd by Brendan Kelly. And I've discovered Matthew Webber, who is wonderful.\n\nTwo things struck me: first, what a vast amount of unsung talent there is out there; and second, to this trader's daughter, how sweetly uncommercial the youngsters were. \"Call it Notting Hill,\" I urged one of the young artists with an untitled work, \"it will walk out the door in seconds.\" I want to insist that anyone going to art college must attend a three-month marketing course, preferably taught by me. It is all about getting your work known, circulated and hung.",

        "text": "With Jane (Jaimie Alexander) in a state of near-constant panic over her identity, Dr. Borden (Ukweli Roach) administers a Rorschach test. But all Jane's got is the memory of weapons training in the woods with the ruggedly handsome man. Meanwhile, Weller (Sullivan Stapleton) has breakfast with his sister Sarah and her son Sawyer, who have moved in while looking for an apartment. Sarah mentions their father called to ask if they're attending Taylor's yearly memorial? Weller is definitely not interested. At work, he tells Patterson (Ashley Johnson) that he noticed a scar on the back of Jane's neck. Then he runs Jane through more weapons training, hoping to trigger another memory. One thing's for sure: Jane knows her guns, and she now remembers shooting a nun in the back of the head. Stunned, she refrains from telling Weller, just as word arrives that Chao is dead of a massive stroke. Surveillance footage shows a man walking away from Chao's room as everyone else rushes toward it... Suddenly, Patterson announces that she's decoded a Vigen\u00e8re cipher on Jane's neck: Maj. Arthur Gibson - a Silver Star-awarded pilot, who once injured, left a desk job in Nevada to work for the Air Force in New York. Convinced Gibson may know something about her, Jane insists on accompanying the team to his home in Brooklyn. Refusing to talk, Gibson orders the team off his property. As they head back to their SUV, Gibson's house explodes.\n\nThe only thing that survives the explosion is a wall safe - no sign of Gibson. The team questions Air Force Colonel Margaret Powers, who explains that after experiencing collateral damage on a mission, Gibson's increasing paranoia and PTSD earned him a desk job and, ultimately, a discharge. But after reviewing Gibson's files, Patterson finds that not only did the Air Force not fire Gibson, they promoted him - and gave him top security clearance. Weller figures the Air Force made Gibson a drone pilot, which means there must be a drone program in New York. Meanwhile, Gibson kidnaps Emily, the six-year-old daughter of his co-worker Alex, in order to force his assistance in launching an armed drone. Moments later, the drone drops a missile on Colonel Powers as she's getting into her SUV. Frustrated, Reade (Rob Brown) wonders whether Jane and her tattoos are to blame. Weller insists it's not Jane's fault; they need to focus on finding Gibson.\n\nFurious, Mayfair (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) calls General Fitzmorris, who admits Gibson worked for a secret domestic drone surveillance program, and the drone he now controls is armed with two more missiles. Distraught over the general's disregard for Emily's welfare, Weller blows up, so Mayfair orders him to stand down. While Reade speculates that whoever tattooed Jane knew about the drone program, Jane flashes back to shooting the nun. Maybe her tattoos are some kind of penance? Mayfair pulls Weller aside, to chastise him for yelling at Fitzmorris. Weller admits he's been thinking about Taylor, who went missing 25 years ago when he was 10. In his last memory of her, Taylor fell while climbing a tree, leaving a scar on the back of her neck - the same scar as Jane's. Weller knows why his name is on Jane's back: Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw.\n\nPaterson cracks Gibson's safe, finding an air-gapped laptop with a list of five seemingly unrelated domestic accidents - yet the victims of each incident were all from the Middle East. Gibson's initials are associated with three, the initials I.M. with the other two. Patterson thinks I.M. is Major Ivon Musgrave, so the team scrambles to his Brooklyn apartment. When Musgrave runs, Jane gives chase. An intense fight ensues, until Weller intervenes, hauling Musgrave onto the street. Musgrave demands to talk to Colonel Powers, just as Jane spies the man from her memory. That's when the second missile hits, blowing the team back into the apartment building. Jane rushes to help an injured Reade, then stumbles back to the street, but the man from her flashback is gone. Back at HQ, Musgrave explains that Gibson wanted to expose the drone program, which was rife with collateral damage. When he asked for help, Musgrave turned him in, then helped the Air Force destroy Gibson's life. Since Gibson has one missile left and is dead set on destroying the program, Weller asks Fitzmorris where the drone pilots work from... and it's the top three floors of the building they're in. Twice a day, every pilot is in the building for a shift change, which is in one hour.\n\nAs the building evacuation begins, Patterson narrows Gibson's location to one of two construction sites in Brooklyn. On the way, Jane tells Weller that she did remember something... what if she's a terrible person? Insisting Jane has a good heart, Weller leaves her in the car, then runs to check the roof. After a firefight, Gibson takes the elevator down as Weller tries and fails to warn Jane. Gibson open fires on the SUV, then drives off, so Jane decides to follow, forcing a crash and rolling her own car, which brings on another flashback. The nun is actually a soldier in disguise. After the shooting, Jane pulls a coded USB fob from around his neck. After pulling a woozy Jane out of the SUV, Weller extracts Emily's location from Gibson and returns the little girl to her father.\n\nBack at HQ, the team argues about the day's events. The Air Force has already come up with a cover story for the press, and Reade isn't convinced Jane's tattoo saved thousands of lives. Mayfair pulls Weller aside to advise that Patterson is running DNA tests to confirm whether Jane truly is Taylor. But Weller doesn't need test results - even if he's not ready to tell Jane. That night, he runs his theory by his sister. Stunned, Sarah reviews how this could change all their lives: their father was accused of kidnapping and killing Taylor, causing their mother to leave. Weller has spent the last 25 years believing his father murdered Taylor... and now their father is dying of pancreatic cancer. Soon. Across town, Jane is surveying the dismal contents of her safe house refrigerator when someone grabs her from behind... the ruggedly handsome man.",

        "text": "Mrs. Clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before California holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party\u2019s nomination. But in choosing to raise concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy stances, she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a Trump presidency.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal Democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances, her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering Republicans to support her this fall.\n\nRoughly 21 percent of independent voters and 32 percent of Republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security, compared with 16 percent of Democrats, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll conducted last month. At the same time, 61 percent of registered voters said a Trump presidency would make America\u2019s image in the world worse, according to the latest New York Times-CBS News poll.\n\n\u201cThere are many Republicans concerned about this,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, an American ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration who also served on Bill Clinton\u2019s National Security Council, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThey find his policy positions beyond the pale, and they\u2019re also turned off by his vulgarity.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the Clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate Republicans who could endorse Mrs. Clinton, largely making the case for foreign policy sure-footedness.\n\nThose calls have included to an aide of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and to Nicholas F. Brady, who served as secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, with plans to reach out to James A. Baker III, a White House chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state under President George Bush.\n\nIn her debates with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions, including urging the Obama administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which she later said was a mistake.\n\nDonald J. Trump told a crowd in Sacramento that NATO states and other allies should be paying the United States compensation for all the U.S. has done for them.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. \u201cBernie Sanders said it and I\u2019m going to use it all over the place because it\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe is a woman who is ill-suited to be president because she has bad judgment.\u201d\n\nAs each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the Oval Office, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are preparing to make a case against Mr. Trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the campaign against McCain or Romney, which was two competing visions,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former White House and Pentagon official under President Obama.\n\nInstead, he said, Mrs. Clinton will remind voters that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un have expressed support for Mr. Trump, who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with Mr. Kim, a pariah worldwide.\n\nMrs. Clinton will also accuse Mr. Trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of American diplomacy that every president has adhered to since World War II.\n\nJulianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the Brussels-based coalition of European nations. Mrs. Clinton, she added, needed to explain to voters that \u201cevery single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances\u201d and that \u201cplaying by the rules makes sense for all of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was \u201cfraudulent\u201d in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions, explaining that he supported global alliances, but believed that the United States should shoulder less of the financial burden.\n\n\u201cOur country can\u2019t afford to protect the world anymore, and at least not get reimbursed for it,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the American-led operation to defeat the Islamic State, ending the economic embargo against Cuba, and pledging unwavering support of Israel.\n\nAnd she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201creckless actions\u201d on foreign policy.\n\nThe San Diego speech, to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when Mr. Trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans\u2019 groups, will present a more sweeping \u2014 and fearsome \u2014 portrayal of Mr. Trump, one that the Clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cThis is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose, not individual policy proposals.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers, who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call for a no-fly zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to Europe. But Mr. Trump, in addressing foreign policy, has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters\u2019 emotional concerns that America has lost its standing in the world.\n\n\u201cYou do get the sense that he\u2019s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate \u2014 and I consider it a minority \u2014 that couldn\u2019t be less interested in facts or realities,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways.\u201d",

The GOP front-runner proposes tax cuts across all income levels, and slashing taxes for those making up to $50,000.\n\n\"With Trump, of course, it's going to benefit the wealthy the most, so as you go up, your paycheck will increase drastically, which would benefit him as well,\" Cole explained on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday.\n\nBut this comes at a cost -- a $9.5 trillion federal deficit over the next decade, which would require drastic reductions in federal spending to help pay for the tax breaks.\n\nRepublican rival Ted Cruz's tax plan would also result in an enormous federal deficit: an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Cruz's plan is the \"most creative,\" Cole said, and would reform the current 750,000-page tax code for a flat tax rate of 10 percent across all incomes.\n\nCruz's plan would also benefit the wealthy most, even more so than Trump's, Cole said. As for the middle class, paychecks may increase by about 50 dollars, according to the International Business Times analysis.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders would also raise the federal deficit with his tax plan, which Cole said was \"more extreme\" than Trump's. The senator vows to raise taxes regardless of your income, with the highest earners paying over 40 percent, for a \"trade off\" for funding free government programs, including college and health care.\n\n\"Unless you need health care, then Bernie Sanders is not going to do a lot for you,\" Cole said.\n\nBut if you want to keep things as they are, Cole said Clinton is your choice. Most Americans can expect the same taxes, and only those making over one million dollars would face an increase. For those making $5 million and over, Clinton plans to add a four percent surtax.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton is very status quo. Her plan is very similar to what we have with President Obama,\" Cole said.\n\n\u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.",

Those attacks, and one in Brussels four months ago, shocked Western Europe, already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration, open borders and pockets of Islamist radicalism.\n\nAuthorities are yet to produce evidence 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, shot dead by police, had any links to Islamic State, which claimed the attack, but Valls said there was no doubt on the assailant's motives.\n\n\"The investigation will establish the facts, but we know now that the killer was radicalised very quickly,\" Valls said in an interview with Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.\n\n\"The claim on Saturday morning by Islamic State and the fast radicalisation of the killer confirms the Islamist nature of this attack.\"\n\nOfficials said on Saturday that people questioned by police had indicated that he had undergone a rapid transformation from someone with no apparent interest in religion.\n\nRelatives and friends interviewed in Nice painted a picture of a man who at least until recently drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and according to French media even ate pork, behaviour that would be unlikely in a devout Muslim.\n\nSpeaking from his home town in Tunisia, Bouhlel's sister told Reuters he had been having psychological problems when he left for France in 2005 and had sought medical treatment.\n\nAs authorities were trying to better understand his motives, two more people, a man and a woman close to Bouhlel, were arrested in Nice early on Sunday, bringing the number of people in detention over the killings to seven.\n\nThe Amaq news agency affiliated with the militant Islamist group said that Bouhlel \"was one of the soldiers of Islamic State\".\n\nValls, who said security services had prevented 16 attacks over three years, indicated that at play on Thursday was the group's modus operandi of cajoling unstable individuals into carrying out attacks with whatever means possible.\n\n\"Daesh gives unstable individuals an ideological kit that allows them to make sense of their acts ... this is probably what happened in Nice's case,\" Valls said, referring to the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.\n\nThe group, which is under military pressure from forces opposed to it, considers France its main target given its military operations in the Middle East, and also because it is easier to strike than the United States, which is leading a coalition against it.\n\nDespite mounting criticism from the conservative opposition and far right over how President Francois Hollande's Socialist government is handling security, Valls said there was no risk zero and new attacks would occur.\n\n\"I've always said the truth regarding terrorism: there is an ongoing war, there will be more attacks. It's difficult to say, but other lives will be lost.\"\n\nWith presidential and parliamentary elections less than a year away, French opposition politicians are increasing pressure and seizing on what they described as security failings that made it possible for the truck to career 2km through large crowds before it was finally halted.\n\nAfter Thursday's attack, a state of emergency imposed across France after the November attacks in Paris was extended by three months.",

        "text": "It's been a good week for women in architecture in general, except for one female architect in particular.\n\nIn the first instance, the Architect's Journal announced the finalists for its inaugural Women in Architecture awards. The magazine's recent championing of female architects, and highlighting of inequalities within the profession, is commendable. Among its findings was that the proportion of female architectural staff in the UK has actually declined since 2009, from 28% to 21% \u2013 this despite the proportion of female architecture students being roughly 50%. That work-life balance is evidently hard to strike in a profession many say is still inherently masculine, with its long apprenticeship, long working hours, and emphasis on competition rather than collaboration. No wonder they've called it the WAA \u2013 it sounds like a cry of despair, doesn't it?\n\nThe shortlists aren't too depressing, though. Eight women are up for the award, including Amanda Levete (formerly of Future Systems, doing well on her own), Roisin Heneghan (of Heneghan Peng, designers of the new London Olympics footbridge) and Sarah Wigglesworth (whose fine Sandal Magna primary school gained her a lot of attention last year). There's also an award for emerging woman architect of the year. The prizes are announced on 20 April. There's a nice (if confusingly Anglo-American) infographic on women in architecture here, by the way.\n\nThe woman for whom it has not been such a great week is the first female architect most people would name: Zaha Hadid. She's up for the WAA as well, but first she lost out on the competition to design the prestigious new Bauhaus Museum in Weimer, Germany, for which she was the only British architect in contention. Her absence was conspicuous, too, when it came to another architecture award: the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) announced the 23-strong shortlist for its inaugural national awards this week, and Zaha's Glasgow Riverside Museum for Transport isn't on it, despite being surely the highest-profile new building in Scotland of the past year. It wasn't a unanimously popular project, but its omission has baffled even its critics. Was it because Zaha has won the Stirling prize for two years running? Has she just become too big?\n\nHadid can at least take consolation from her inclusion in the V&A's new exhibition on British design, which opens today. The exhibition's architecture component includes a model of her Aquatics Centre, the only female-designed building in the show, as far as I could see. There are plenty of the usual architectural suspects here: the postwar Festival of Britain generation; Basil Spence; Denys Lasdun; big models of Foster's Gherkin and Rogers's Lloyds building.\n\nOne discovery for me was John Prizeman, about whom I'd known very little. He was an accomplished writer, and his work mainly focused on domestic interiors, particularly kitchens. There are illustrations of two small designs by him that caught my eye. One was his \"Soft-Tech House for the 1980s\" \u2013 an evocative, late-70s vision of \"the future\" that looks like a cross between Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House and a sort of Hobbit-style eco-dwelling. It's somehow simultaneously quaint and ahead of its time.\n\nThe other, particularly pertinent in the context of women in architecture, is a cutaway illustration of a neat, compact family home Prizeman designed in 1959. It's bracingly modern, with fitted kitchens, free-flowing living areas and a new Mini in the garage, though its name wasn't exactly progressive: it's called Her House. It says it all that the woman in Prizeman's dream home is depicted bustling around indoors; the man is lounging on the back terrace.\n\nFinally, another new discovery this week was Architects of Invention, a practice that not only has one of the best names in the business but looks to be living up to it. It is headed by Niko Japaridze, a former senior architect at Rem Koolhaas's OMA, who has worked in the UK and also has offices in his native Georgia. Last year, the firm wove a snaking wooden staircase through the new headquarters it designed for Georgia's National Olympic Committee, and has recently finished an imposing new building in Tbilisi with an imposing name: The Prosecutor's Office. It looks like a giant black filing cabinet, with square, glass rooms projecting out like half-opened drawers. Seventy per cent of the building is hung off the ground. The interior is just as startling \u2013 its long central staircase with green glass walls looks like something out of The Matrix. Japaridze has a host of other promising-looking buildings going up in Georgia. He also claims to be Tbilisi's one millionth citizen. One to watch.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2012. The original misspelled the names of Roisin Heneghan and Heneghan Peng architects as Roisin Peneghan of Peneghan Heng. This has been corrected.",

Mr. Ailes denied the charges through his lawyer.\n\nIt immediately raised new questions about whether the Murdochs would be forced into a bigger house cleaning of Mr. Ailes\u2019s remaining team of lieutenants at Fox News, where, it seems, sexual harassment payouts were not followed by the recognition that there just might be a problem, let alone by any obvious attempts to aggressively address the corporate culture that facilitated the behavior in the first place.\n\nMr. Ailes\u2019s departure from the network leaves a huge vacuum in its own right. He drove it to pursue the stories that helped define the strife of the Clinton, Bush (No. 43) and Obama eras. He made it a TV headquarters for the patriotism-infused Bush war marketing effort; the false accusations that Mr. Obama was a \u201csocialist\u201d of dubious citizenship, and, most recently, the Trump movement.\n\nMr. Murdoch abided by it all, even when it conflicted with some of his own views, such as his support for a path to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants. But as often as not he seemed to be in line with Mr. Ailes, at least based on how he portrayed himself on Twitter \u2014 as a \u201cclimate change skeptic\u201d; as a fan of Dr. Ben Carson, \u201ca real black president who can properly address the racial divide\u201d; and as one who believes: \u201cMaybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.\u201d\n\nThough executives who have worked with Lachlan Murdoch say they assume he shares some of his father\u2019s conservatism, they also say he does not readily advertise his views, which is in itself a major departure from the elder Murdoch.\n\nAs for James Murdoch, his leanings are in plainer view than his brother\u2019s, and they are decidedly different from his father\u2019s (with an important exception, friends say: free-market fiscal policy).\n\nJames Murdoch\u2019s wife, Kathryn, is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund and a former director at the Clinton Climate Initiative. The couple started Quadrivium, a foundation that focuses on the \u201csustainable use of resources\u201d and \u201cscientific understanding.\u201d James has spearheaded initiatives to make the company \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d\n\nIn an essay in Time magazine in December, he wrote, \u201cEntrenched and compromised interests spin the fiction that science is more divided than united, and they sow seeds of uncertainty on issues of unquestionable priority: namely, the survival of our species on this planet.\u201d\n\nHis views have heartened producers and executives at National Geographic, which 21st Century Fox took greater control of last year.\n\nFox News\u2019s reporting often tells a much different story. Its hosts don\u2019t hesitate to report that \u201cthe science is still in question,\u201d as Heather Childers recently did, or that warnings about climate change are emanating from \u201cpeople aligned with the political left in the scientific community,\u201d as the host Steve Doocy said in April while promoting a film purporting to debunk climate change.\n\nEven before Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster, climate activists were hopeful that James Murdoch would force changes to skeptical coverage of climate change at Fox News, as well as its corporate cousin The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page has great sway with congressional Republicans.\n\nTo nudge it along, one group, Partnership for Responsible Growth, has run ads with both outlets reminding Republicans that their leaders used to support market-based solutions to climate change \u2014 and calling on The Journal\u2019s editorial page to acknowledge humankind\u2019s role.\n\nDavid Fenton, a longtime strategist for progressive causes whose agency, Fenton, made the ads, said its main goal was to push a bipartisan solution in the form of a carbon pricing system. The Murdoch outlets have been standing in the way, he said, by creating a \u201cfalse reality bubble denying science\u201d that scares amenable Republican politicians away from the cause.\n\n\u201cJames knows better, and there\u2019s no way that someone like that could be happy with the terribly negative role the Murdoch properties have played in slowing bipartisan action on climate,\u201d Mr. Fenton said.\n\nNone of the Murdochs would comment for this column.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to talk about the intersection of their political and business interests without lingering for a moment on the latter. Even if some of Fox News\u2019s programming drives one or both of the brothers bananas, it is still a major cash generator for 21st Century Fox, with $1.6 billion in operating profit in fiscal 2015, according to Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.\n\nFox News\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre was to fill a void that conservative-leaning viewers sensed in the mainstream media. That guiding philosophy has provided a steady compass, and a lucrative revenue stream, as its competitors have struggled with their own paths.\n\nThat could provide a strong argument against drastic change, especially for the elder Mr. Murdoch, who is by all accounts enjoying his new role running the network and is saying he won\u2019t rush into picking a successor to Mr. Ailes. It seems a near certainty that he will stay through the election.\n\nWith Mr. Murdoch at the helm, the network covered Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention in Philadelphia with all the skepticism you\u2019d expect. It didn\u2019t show the speech of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a fallen American soldier. Then, there was Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s aside that the slaves who built the White House, whom Michelle Obama referred to in her prime-time address, were \u201cwell fed\u201d and adequately housed.\n\nThat said, Fox News\u2019s audience tends to be older, which is why executives there indicate that the family views its younger prime-time star, Megyn Kelly, as an important part of its future. Her appeal extends to the core Fox News viewer as well as to those with more mainstream news tastes.\n\nMs. Kelly\u2019s contract, like Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, comes up for renewal next year. Before Mr. Ailes left, Ms. Kelly seemed certain to leave. Now it\u2019s a given that her decision will depend on how the Murdochs decide to proceed \u2014 as will so, so much else.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 1, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: With Ailes Out, and Murdoch In, What\u2019s Next at Fox News?.

        "text": "A couple of experts have just been on the radio warning against a dangerous growth in addictive behaviour among adults in western societies, much of it including internet gambling, porn and gaming, deliberately designed to be so. At the same time the Daily Beast is reporting excitedly that other experts are telling us not to drink more than three glasses of wine a week.\n\nYes, that's not a misprint. Clever chaps at Oxford University have concluded that the optimum intake of alcohol to dent booze-related deaths should be around 5g a day \u2013 that's slightly more than half a \"unit\" (8g) as currently defined, half of one (125ml) small scotch, half a half pint of beer, half a mean glass of red wine.\n\nMuddled messages here? You bet. The experts who complain about the commercial fostering of dirty habits are surely right. It's obvious to anyone who has watched a small child adeptly playing on an iPad, a teenager \u2013 including those of 35 \u2013 game-playing on a PC screen, let alone a harassed housewife getting past the chocolate and junk food in the queue for the supermarket till.\n\nBut half a glass of wine a day, what my father's generation would have dismissed as merely a dirty glass? As the saying goes, that sounds like a cure worse than the lurking diseases, public policy with little credibility which both contradicts other research that says that moderate drinking is good for most people \u2013 and undermines the Department of Health's (DH) official guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines have themselves been shrinking safe drinking for years. Twenty-eight units a week for men? Or 21? Twenty-one for women \u2013 or 14? The DH has changed its mind. What's more the number of units in a bottle of wine or scotch seems to be changing too. Ah well, say the puritans, the stuff's getting stronger. They say that about pot, too.\n\nTobacco? Well, that's more straightforward and is more a matter of liberty \u2013 the right to sell a legal (and tax-lucrative) substance using lawfully owned brand labels \u2013 than of health. Andrew Lansley is surely more right than wrong (I don't say this every week) to argue that alcohol, even crisps in moderation, are OK, but that in health terms the potential damage in tobacco always outweighs the pleasure of the drag.\n\nBy coincidence, the papers also contain warnings from the Health Protection Agency that sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise again among those young people not totally addicted to Grand Theft Auto. Charities rush to blame government cuts in the health education budget \u2013 they would, wouldn't they? \u2013 though it's not father-of-five Lansley who is not taking the precautions that put young people at risk. It's the young people \u2013 and we all remember why. It didn't seem important at the time.\n\nThe cost of all these bad lifestyle choices is considerable, both in terms of the battered NHS budget and the misery it causes, ill-health, premature death, infertility, domestic violence. Yet we struggle to get a handle on it. On one page of the Daily Beast, people who should know better complain that the nanny state interferes too much in our lives, on the next it demands more intervention to protect us from risks that most adults should be sensible enough to evaluate without having to be told.\n\nThe struggle between liberty and 'elf 'n' safety is beautifully illustrated by Thursday's Guardian report about the German climber on Everest who took that now-famous shot of the traffic jam of those mostly romantic amateurs (one carrying his bike) queuing to try to climb the world's highest mountain. Some will die, he thought sadly, and four later did. Lethal places mountains, even for the experts.\n\nYet the German climber, Ralf Dujmovits, encountered what he called \"an overweight French journalist\" \u2013 a woman weighing 80kg \u2013 who had used up all her oxygen long before she had reached the point where a proper climber would need it. Who let her climb? Who sold her the oxygen? It's not a self-regarding action that merely puts her own life at risk. Mountains aren't like that. Climbers are roped.\n\nFast-forward to the Oxford report. Yes, we know that booze can kill and maim. We can see that every day \u2013 though in Fleet Street and Westminster I see rather less of it than I once did and admit to slightly mixed feelings: it was so much more fun in the old days before the new puritanism took hold, a puritanism that is, incidentally, hedonistic in its own way.\n\nBut I can't believe any good is served for scientists to step in at a time when governments in London and Edinburgh are grappling with the most effective model of unit pricing (how to target the winos' tipple without being unfair to the sober poor) and suggest that virtual teetotalism is the answer. It just defies belief and as such is bad policy. My oldest friend still drinks four or five proper units a day every day \u2013 and he's pushing 85.",

That means the end of ski season is near\u2014perfect timing for a little reflection on how technology has become front-and-center in the skiing experience.\n\nIt\u2019s been a spectacular winter for Lake Tahoe. After several years of drought, El Nino blessed California with the most snow it has had since 2012. But pristine powder isn\u2019t the only new thing on the slopes this year. Increasingly, mobile apps and social features are table stakes for Tahoe resorts, letting skiers track their vertical feet and purchase those annoying photos someone\u2019s always taking of you at the top of the mountain. As I discovered on a recent reporting expedition to Lake Tahoe (I swear, it was for work), even the way the mountains are groomed and artificial snow is made has changed. Just as you would expect, much of the process is now automated, controlled remotely by\u2014you guessed it\u2014mobile devices.\n\nA lot of the noticeable innovations on the slopes are about consumer-facing mobile features (and, of course, drones\u2014more on that in a bit). Vail Resorts, which owns the likes of Tahoe\u2019s Northstar and Heavenly, has had a chief information officer for years. It now employs a growing team of mobile apps developers. The company launched its EpicMix ski app about six years ago, but added features like social sharing in recent years. (One new addition that has yet to make it to Tahoe: a tool that shows wait times at different lifts.)\n\nBack when I first learned to ski, a frighteningly long time ago, the coolest \u201ctech\u201d on the mountain was the gondola. But it wasn\u2019t all that frighteningly long ago that cell phone reception was still spotty at the top of the mountain. Now, places like Vail-owned resorts are giving skiers more reasons to pull out their phones on the slopes\u2014not just to take selfies. The company says EpicMix now has about 700,000 users.\n\nThen there is the small matter of drones. At nearby Squaw Valley (not owned by Vail), skiers can pay $99 to have a drone film them making their way down the mountain. In order to make this dream-you-didn\u2019t-know-you-had come true, the resort partnered with a company called Cape Productions. \u201cWe are competing with lots of other opportunities for how people spend money on their leisure time,\u201d says Louis Gresham, one of the skiers-turned-techies who started Cape.\n\nAt this point, drones are a tiny business for ski resorts (Gresham says that in addition to sharing revenue with the resorts, Cape gives them access to the footage they shoot). But I\u2019m willing to bet that, like it or not, they will have a growing presence on the slopes. That is, of course, if the damn weather doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\nOne drawback to all those winter storms we\u2019ve been getting here in the California mountains: High winds and heavy precipitation make it very hard for drones to fly. Even in the age of software, Mother Nature still rules.",

        "text": "Sam Brinton says that his father first tried physical abuse to rid his young son of homosexual feelings. When that didn\u2019t work, Brinton\u2019s parents turned to something called reparative therapy.\n\nSome of the memories are hazy more than 10 years later, but Brinton does remember the tactics the counselor used. There was talk therapy, about how God disapproved, and there was aversion therapy, during which pictures of men touching men would be accompanied by the application of heat or ice. \u201cIt was pretty much mental torture,\u201d Brinton says. \u201cTo this day, I still have light pain when I shake hands with another male.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade after leading medical organizations abandoned the idea that homosexuality was something that could be cured or corrected, the concept of conversion therapy remains a particularly charged issue for LGBT advocates. Two states outlaw the practice and legislation is pending in another. But not all the momentum is against reparative therapy. Earlier this month the Texas Republican Party voted to include support for the practice in their party platform. Now a group of advocates and lawmakers are launching a new effort to ban licensed counselors from trying to change a minor\u2019s sexual orientation through therapy of any kind.\n\nOn June 24, the National Center for Lesbian Rights will announce the beginning of a campaign called #BornPerfect, an educational and legislative push to \u201cmake clear that every LGBT person is born perfect,\u201d says executive director Kate Kendell. \u201cIt is now generally understood that sexual orientation cannot and should not be changed and that efforts to change it are damaging.\u201d She believes that the time is right for the campaign, as LGBT people have become more accepted in society and medical establishments have come out against what is also called conversion therapy.\n\nOn June 16, the New York State assembly voted 86 to 28 to pass a reparative-therapy ban, and though Governor Andrew Cuomo expressed support for the bill, lawmakers in the GOP-controlled state senate blocked the measure from coming to the floor for a full vote. Had the senate passed the bill, New York would have become the third state, after California and New Jersey, to put such a law on the books.\n\nOpponents like Liberty Counsel, a legal organization affiliated with Liberty University, were also ready to file a lawsuit, much like those the organization filed against the California and New Jersey laws.\n\nDaniel Schmid, Liberty Counsel\u2019s lead litigator, says that bans on reparative therapy potentially violate the freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights of those who would perform or seek it. \u201cIf you allow [counselors] to talk about sexual orientation to minors, you can\u2019t allow only one viewpoint to be presented,\u201d he says. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against that argument in California last August, instead siding with the logic that such a law amounts to professional regulation, a condition for providing state counseling licenses. Schmid and his clients, including therapists and families, have appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nHomosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a diagnostic bible published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), in 1973. In 1998, the APA released a statement saying the organization \u201copposes any psychiatric treatment, such as \u2018reparative\u2019 or \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder, or based upon a prior assumption that the patient should change his/her homosexual orientation.\u201d Schmid argues that the statement is based more on politics than documentation of harm caused by such therapy.\n\nThe #BornPerfect campaign will aim to dissuade parents who might be considering reparative therapy by providing them access to psychological experts and those who have been through such treatment, like Brinton. \u201cWe have no doubt they love their children,\u201d Kendell says, noting that many parents might believe LGBT people lead more difficult lives and wish to spare their children from hardship. \u201cWe want parents to understand there are resources for them to come to terms with embracing their child as they are,\u201d she says, whether those are online or public forums. The campaign will also include ongoing legislative efforts in other states to pass reparative-therapy bans, though Kendell declined to say which will be next at this time for fear it would mobilize the movement\u2019s opponents.\n\nThough conversion therapy is largely associated with sexual orientation, the #BornPerfect campaign will also aim to prevent therapy that is aimed at changing a child\u2019s gender identity, in the cases that a child does not identify with the gender that corresponds with the sex that was assigned at birth. \u201cTo the extent that this is a budding practice,\u201d Kendell says, \u201cwe want to nip it.\u201d\n\nOne well-known reparative therapist is Joseph Nicolosi, based in Encino, Calif. A banner at the top of his website says, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have to Be Gay,\u201d with bullet points that advertise the ability to \u201cDiminish your unwanted homosexuality\u201d and \u201cDevelop your heterosexual potential.\u201d Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, which has also worked to oppose the reparative-therapy bans, argues that sexual orientation is \u201cfluid well into adulthood\u201d and can be influenced by factors such as a domineering mother or history of sexual abuse. \u201cA truly tolerant nation is one that respects the rights of all Americans,\u201d he says, \u201cnot just those who happen to be the political majority of a legislature.\u201d\n\nAfter a year and a half in therapy, and multiple suicide attempts, Brinton finally lied and promised to have been cured of homosexual thoughts. \u201cIt kept me in the closet for so many years,\u201d Brinton says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of internalized shame. And it\u2019s all related to just this nagging trauma of something\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

Or EMC emc , which is looking for salvation in Dell\u2019s arms. But the darkest storm clouds are starting to lift, at least for hardware companies who have retooled their equipment for the cloud era. Sometime during the past 12 months, it appears many businesses swapped the question, \u201cShould I move my IT operations to the cloud?\u201d for this one \u201cWhen is the best time for our cloud transition?\u201d\n\nUnder the cloud computing model, applications and other IT resources are delivered via pools of servers, storage devices, and networking gear over which businesses may have very little management control. Slowly but surely, organizations of all sizes are opting to use these services for a larger portion of their IT operations.\n\nThat means, of course, that fewer companies are buying servers and other gear for their own data centers. Instead, more are opting to rent from the likes of Amazon amzn Web Services, Microsoft msft , and Google goog (the \u201cBig Three\u201d of cloud computing). The latest evidence lies in purchasing patterns reported last week by market research firm IDC.\n\nLast year, spending on hardware meant for big clouds increased 22% to almost $29 billion. Indeed, almost one-third of the fourth-quarter equipment revenue attributable to tech giants Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe , Dell, Cisco csco , EMC, and IBM was generated by hardware intended for cloud installations. We can expect more of the same this year: IDC projects spending on cloud-related computing hardware will top $38 billion, continuing to grow by double digits for at least the next several years. By 2020, spending on infrastructure for \u201cpublic\u201d cloud services\u2014those shared among businesses rather than dedicated to serving a single company\u2014will reach $37.5 billion.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of this transition has been Cisco, which sells equipment converging features of servers and networking gear. Revenue for that portion of its product portfolio grew almost 36% during the fourth quarter to $802 million, reports IDC.\n\nOf course, the hardware manufacturers are by no means out of the woods. Many of the biggest cloud service providers\u2014including Facebook fb and Amazon\u2014are opting to build their build their own gear to keep costs down while personalizing their design needs. Now that momentum is building, it\u2019s up to the likes of HPE, Dell/EMC, and Cisco to prove their value again.",

        "text": "A week ago, the Japanese island of Kyushu in the country\u2019s south was hit by an earthquake that killed at least nine people, injured hundreds of others and caused significant damage. Measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, the quake mainly affected the town of Mashiki on the outskirts of Kumamoto city.\n\nThe real devastation, however, came around 48 hours later, when the same region was struck by a far more powerful, magnitude 7.3 quake. At least 33 others were killed in the second quake, which left close to 200,000 displaced and thousands of homes without electricity or running water.\n\nThe same day as the second temblor, around 9,000 miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Ecuador was hit with an earthquake that far exceeded the destruction seen in Japan. Even as the death toll from the 7.8-magnitude quake rose to almost 600, the South American nation was rocked by several aftershocks \u2014 including one on Wednesday that measured 6.1.\n\nDespite the timing of the two disasters and their presence in the earthquake-prone zone known as the Ring of Fire, seismologists say a connection between them is unlikely and not necessarily indicative of a larger trend.\n\n\u201cWe do know that large earthquakes cluster,\u201d says Gary Gibson, a seismologist and professor at the University of Melbourne, adding that the most recent cluster \u2014 including a 6.9-magnitude tremor felt in Burma (Myanmar) last week that caused minimum damage \u2014 has been particularly active.\n\n\u201cThe last two or three weeks have been exceptional, there is no question about that,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cBut in terms of worrying about whether it means an even bigger one somewhere else, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nWu Pak-cheuk, who heads the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, tells TIME that a correlation between the two sets of earthquakes is highly unlikely, because they \u201care a little too far away, and not on the same [tectonic] plate.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, both countries were also hit with different types of quakes, with the two that hit Japan likely resulting from something called a strike-slip, that occurs along faults situated at a relatively shallow level. The Ecuador earthquake, on the other hand, occurred because of a process known as subduction \u2014 where one tectonic plate slides under another to create what is known as a \u201cmegathrust\u201d event.\n\nA geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey tells CNN, however, that research into a phenomenon called \u201cremote triggering\u201d \u2014 where an earthquake in one part of the world can cause another some distance away \u2014 is still ongoing.",

        "text": "A few years back, I used to tell people I was a comedian (if they asked, that is, not apropos of nothing). I decided to stop doing that when a good friend\u2019s teenage brother observed with earnest confusion, having spent 10 minutes talking to me, that I couldn\u2019t be a comedian, since I\u2019m not funny. These days, I say I\u2019m a writer. As well as finding the incident personally crushing, the brother\u2019s damning verdict made me realise something about the way people tend to think about what \u201cbeing funny\u201d is, and how it ought to manifest itself. To this logical lad, and many others, people are funny in the same way as they are \"tall\" or \"Japanese\" \u2013 it\u2019s an ever-present, empirically obvious part of their nature.\n\nThe reason I write all this is not simply to win an argument with my friend\u2019s younger brother, but to make a wider point about comedy, especially in literature. I\u2019ve recently been writing a stage adaptation of a Dostoevsky short story called The Crocodile, which is funny in ways that are playful and profound and pretty politically punchy. In the process of writing it, I\u2019ve come to learn that many people don\u2019t think of Dostoevsky as funny at all, and the assertion that he can be hilarious tends to meet with, at best, suspicion and, at worst, polite indulgence. Which is quite annoying for me, and, I imagine, had he the means of eavesdropping, maddening for him.\n\nLike my friend\u2019s brother, readers seem to have no problem declaring that a writer is or isn\u2019t funny without really justifying themselves or providing a list of the stuff that makes them laugh for us to assess their relative expertise or trustworthiness. Of all the areas of literature, humour has the strange privilege of being by far the most personal in appreciation and the most objective in judgment. Imagine if we talked about writers being \u201cmoving\u201d or \u201cinsightful\u201d in the same cack-handed way as we talk about them being \u201cfunny\u201d. I doubt that readers and critics would declare with the same confidence that \u201cDostoevsky isn\u2019t moving\u201d or that \u201cKafka isn\u2019t insightful\u201d as they might brazenly offer up a sentence like \u201cBeckett isn\u2019t funny\u201d. Which, by the way, he is. Sometimes.\n\n\u2022 100 funny jokes by 100 comedians\n\nAnyone who spends any time on the internet, especially among the lynch mobs who operate underneath every YouTube comedy clip, will be aware that the often innocent act of someone trying to be funny can make people murderously cross with each other. There are semi-religious wars raging online between fanatics who know in their heart what funny feels like, and make self-righteous pronouncements that crumble instantly under the weight of the most basic analysis. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t funny\u201d or \u201cGermans aren\u2019t funny\u201d, for example, are sentences that have the power to offend only because of the wilfully unsophisticated way we think about what \u201cbeing funny\u201d means. To say \u201cwomen aren\u2019t moving\u201d or \u201cGermans aren\u2019t wet\u201d wouldn\u2019t even make enough sense to be offensive. It would just be weird.\n\nThe Inbetweeners star Simon Bird will be perfroming in Basden's The Crocodile (Photo: Film4)\n\nIronically, the bloody-minded zeal that reduces all conversations about humour to people yelling \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d at each other is the very thing I find funniest in Dostoevsky\u2019s writing. Pomposity is one of the few growth industries in the age of the internet, and Dostoevsky\u2019s characters in stories like The Crocodile, The Gambler and Notes From the Underground are brilliantly observed, furiously funny forebears of the self-important online troll. I won\u2019t try to convince you of his comic genius here by quoting sentences out of context, because the only things that work well in isolation are one-liners, which, to be fair to the guy, are in short supply. Besides, trying to explain what\u2019s funny about something is the surest way to kill it.\n\n\u2022 Trying is the first step towards failure: 30 great one-liners\n\nPerversely perhaps, it\u2019s the humourlessness of Dostoevsky\u2019s characters, such as the truculent Alexei Ivanovich and the passionately progressive Ivan Matveeitch, that makes them so funny (to me, anyway), and renders their puny battles with society so laughable. Even if his writing doesn\u2019t tickle you, spending time with some of Dostoevsky\u2019s spiteful solipsists will at the very least provide an unnerving insight into how we all sound when mouthing off to anyone who\u2019ll listen about why some comedy is frankly unacceptable or unfunny. As the hero in Dostoevsky\u2019s The Dream of a Ridiculous Man complains to the world, capturing the angry sadness of the morally certain, and the daily difficulty we all experience when talking to people who disagree with us on matters of taste: \u201cOh, how hard it is when you\u2019re the only one who knows the truth!\u201d\n\nThe Crocodile is at the Manchester International Festival until July 18",

He describes himself, using expletives, as \u201ca 260-pound black guy with a don\u2019t-mess-with-me face.\u201d\n\nHe is also a Juggalo.\n\nThis week, Mr. Perkins, 31, known to friends as Less Legs, and thousands of other Juggalos and Juggalettes have made the pilgrimage to Thornville, Ohio, to take part in the 17th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos. The nicknames, claimed by fans of the rap duo Insane Clown Posse, come from the group\u2019s 1992 track \u201cThe Juggla.\u201d\n\nAfter arriving, many of the Juggalos paint their faces with heavy clown makeup, indulge in drugs and alcohol, attend concerts of Insane Clown Posse acolytes and hop on amusement park rides. The retreat started at 7 a.m. on Wednesday and will end Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a psycho-porn theme park,\u201d says Camille Dodero, a journalist who attended four consecutive gatherings starting in 2010 and is attending this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an intense sensory overload.\u201d\n\nThe number 17 holds an important place in the iconography of Insane Clown Posse, which has elevated the significance of this year\u2019s event. But news outlets and online gawkers have been gobbling up the spectacle for years, especially since since the release of \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d a short, lewd independent documentary from 2011 that captured the scene before much of the mainstream came calling.\n\n\u201cI saw that movie a hundred times,\u201d Mr. Perkins said. \u201cI showed my friends that movie to enlighten them on Juggalos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d introduced many people to the humans behind the movement for the first time.\n\nThe documentary also helped to defang the image of the Juggalos, described by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in February 2011 as a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d but now widely regarded as a tribe of mostly harmless outcasts.\n\nThe director of \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d Sean Dunne, 35, a filmmaker who grew up in the suburbs of New York City, said that he was inspired to make the movie in 2010 after Tila Tequila, a Myspace celebrity who performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos that year, was pelted with rocks and beer bottles before being chased from the stage to her trailer.\n\n\u201cI remember sitting around and thinking that there was no way they could be that bad,\u201d Mr. Dunne said of the Juggalos. \u201cAnd I went to the gathering, and they really weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Dunne\u2019s film barely mentions Insane Clown Posse itself. It ignores the concerts and carnival events of the gathering. Instead, it features more than a dozen interviews with Juggalos enjoying each other\u2019s company, many of them ingesting drugs or alcohol, and several of them at least partly nude.\n\nThe documentary also features a Juggalette nicknamed Maniac who claims to be sober, though Mr. Dunne clarifies: \u201cJuggalo sober is a little different from what we would think of as sober.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuggalo sober is like, you only had 10 beers, smoked some weed and did a little molly,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr. Dunne\u2019s film shows Juggalos at their most hedonic, it is often a sympathetic portrayal, showing his interview subjects to be friendly, tolerant and inclusive. In \u201cAmerican Juggalo,\u201d the festival resembles what it is often promoted as by its attendees: an enormous family reunion.\n\nSince it was posted to the video-sharing service Vimeo in September 2011, \u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d has been viewed more than 2 million times. Sam Morrill, a lead curator for the website, called the documentary \u201cone of the most provocative and celebrated films\u201d on Vimeo.\n\nNot all Juggalos appreciate the film\u2019s influence. Jason Shaltz, a photographer who has been a fan of Insane Clown posse since the mid-90s, will celebrate his 36th birthday at the Gathering of the Juggalos on Thursday. He said that while he admires Mr. Dunne\u2019s talent, \u201cAmerican Juggalo\u201d chose to turn the cameras away from Insane Clown Posse and the other musical artists at the festival, the central element that draws the Juggalos together every year.\n\n\u201cI think it catapulted into the public eye because of the freak show aspect of it,\u201d Mr. Shaltz said. \u201cPeople like to watch train wrecks.\u201d\n\nMr. Perkins, who moonlights as a rapper himself, disagrees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the story \u2014 we make up the community,\u201d he said of the Juggalos. \u201cI know people who go to the gathering that are deaf. That are blind.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the year after the film was released, the media presence at the event, as well as the percentage of non-Juggalos in attendance, increased. Several outlets made films similar to Mr. Dunne\u2019s and many others featured articles and slide shows that took a mocking tone toward the group.\n\n\u201cOnce the Gathering of the Juggalos wasn\u2019t something to fear, people started going as an extreme adventure,\u201d Ms. Dodero said.\n\nOnce the general public catches wind of a music festival, the event is often lamented as having changed for the worse. This summer, The Times\u2019s music critics said that they would not cover the more mainstream events Coachella and Bonnaroo, writing that many festivals \u201clook increasingly alike in their vision of a codified, consensual, safe and purchasable bohemia.\u201d\n\nBut the Gathering of the Juggalos has remained outside the mainstream, fans say, and has not changed with the influx of tourists looking for a thrill. If anything, attendees say, the Juggalos have a way of converting the newcomers.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like it when jerky hipsters come in,\u201d Ms. Dodero said. \u201cBut even then, I\u2019ve seen the biggest jerky hipster be transformed within 12 hours, saying, \u2018These are the best people ever.\u2019\u201d",

He met Monday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nMr. Steinmeier said both Russia and Ukraine should step back from a looming confrontation along their de facto border on the Crimean peninsula, where Russia said two of its soldiers died in a skirmish with a Ukrainian commando group that had slipped across. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014.\n\nThe foreign minister of Russia, Sergey V. Lavrov, talked about the country's intention to use diplomacy to reduce tensions with Ukraine.\n\nWhether any such skirmish took place remains a matter of dispute. Ukraine has denied it, and says the Kremlin invented the story to escalate tensions and to whip up nationalist passions before parliamentary elections next month.\n\nA Russian television report documenting the arrest of a couple of Ukrainian commandos included shots of a full moon at dusk, though the moon was waning on the date of the alleged incident. While that raised suspicions, the shot may have been stock footage, intended to convey a nighttime atmosphere in Crimea and not tied to the specific date of the episode.\n\nRussian security services have also released a video of a detained man, Yevgeny Panov, said to have led the raid. Olga Kovitidi, a Russian senator, emphasized in comments reported by the Russian news media that Mr. Panov is a driver at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the closest such facility to the war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts said the commentary was one of the first significant instances of Russia raising the prospect of instability affecting the nuclear industry in Ukraine, with dark echoes of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Ukraine operates four civilian power plants with 15 reactors, and several research institutes hold radioactive materials.\n\nDuring the meeting on Monday, Mr. Lavrov said Russia was ready to supply additional evidence proving the Ukrainian incursion into Crimea.\n\nOn Monday, Vedomosti, a Russian newspaper, reported that Moscow might respond by unleashing rebel forces in eastern Ukraine. The authorities, the report said, are considering \u201cceasing to hold back the actions of the army of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d the main Russian-backed rebel group, which has threatened to attack across the line of control in eastern Ukraine in response to shelling from government positions into populated areas.\n\nMr. Steinmeier pressed Mr. Lavrov to abide by the battered and now nearly two-year-old truce between Russian-backed rebels and the Ukrainian government, known as the Minsk agreement.\n\nStriking a conciliatory note, Mr. Lavrov said Russia intended to continue diplomatic relations with Ukraine in spite of earlier comments that they might be broken off over the skirmish in Crimea, but said a final decision rested with President Vladimir V. Putin.",

The reality is that today Assad\u2019s people are still killing more Syrians than Isil \u2013 but it is a close thing. It is also clear from intelligence that the US air campaign against the terrorist group has been causing it to change.\n\nWhile Iraqi Ba\u2019athists remain in firm control and their officers command the majority of the military capability made up of lowly Sunni Arab tribal fighters, their degradation has meant foreign fighters \u2013 including British subjects \u2013 are rising to command appointments and influential posts. Those who have had contact with the group have identified the British Jihadists as militarily inept, yet by far the most bloodthirsty. These people are increasingly unpalatable to the vast majority of the Sunni tribes who populate Isil territory.\n\nAlthough the majority of the Isil fighters are Sunni Arab tribal fighters, they are increasingly reluctantly so. Trapped between the Assad Shia regime and the Shia-dominated Iraqi regime, they are effectively stateless. This is a direct result of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. This was a situation that was bound to cause strife. It has handed Isil a constituency. They have driven out the Christians, Yazidis and Druze as well as other minorities, all in order to strengthen their grip.\n\nNow we need a diplomatic effort in tandem with bombing to wrest that constituency back. The Sunni Arabs of the region need a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, something to hope for if they are ever to rise up against Isil. The minorities need to believe they won\u2019t be slaughtered if they return. The bottom line is that we need to give Syrian and Iraqi Sunni Arabs (as well as Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and others) a homeland free from the control of Iran and its proxies and rid of Isil \u2013 a safe place to return to. Hope for jobs, education and dignity. None of that is in Russia or Iran\u2019s plan. It must be the war aim of ours. We have to grab the initiative.\n\nThat means carving out a new Arab homeland that is free from external control. Such an entity must take account of the needs and wishes of Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia as well as the Russians, Iran and the Iranian proxies. This plan must be forced through for a just peace.\n\nBut will bombing help? There is no doubt we must degrade Isil\u2019s military capability and we must eliminate those who are targeting the UK directly. But I believe that we must tackle Isil as part of a wider campaign to solve the bigger crisis, and to aid our allies \u2013 the Free Syrians and the Kurds. We must address the crisis that is generating the refugee wave and which is at the heart of the regional instability.\n\nSadly, President Obama has displayed a complete lack of leadership in the region. It is clear he is a follower, so there needs to be a leader. I look to David Cameron to step up. We need our other allies in Saudi and Turkey and Jordan to focus and back us up in confronting Assad and defeating Isil. That means accepting and backing a plan for a Sunni homeland. We need to agree demarcation lines with Russia and her ally Iran. That all will need British leadership.\n\nBut the starting point is that MPs must vote to support a campaign to bomb Isil. Ignore Corbyn. Labour MPs will vote supportively in sufficient numbers. But we need to also work with our allies to help conceive and then create an entity to fill the vacuum that will be created when Isil collapses and when Assad and the Iraqi rump is safe behind Iranian lines. That requires strong British influence and leadership from the UK.

The law is set to take effect on Aug. 1.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Austin on Wednesday, requests a federal judge block license holders from bringing their guns to one of the nation\u2019s largest campuses, Reuters reports. The Texas law allows university presidents to enact their own rules regarding concealed handguns as long as those rules don\u2019t generally prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons on campus, and a 19-member task force at the University of Texas in Austin voted to recommend that concealed handguns be allowed in classrooms in December.

They filed a third set of charges in July linked to Google search services offered to third-party websites, like newspapers and online retailers.\n\nGoogle denies wrongdoing in those cases, saying that it competes on equal terms with companies like Yelp and Microsoft, among others. It also says that cellphone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches.\n\nThe company\u2019s antitrust woes have also spread to the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering claims that Google\u2019s activities linked to Android are uncompetitive. American officials previously investigated whether the company had unfairly favored some of its services over those of rivals within its search engine, but they eventually decided not to bring charges.\n\nAnd in India, one of Google\u2019s fast-growing markets, the national antitrust authority sent the company a report last year outlining its concerns about search dominance and anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe Indian officials suggested that the company was abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people with knowledge of the report, which has not been made public.\n\nFollow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 12, 2016, on page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Fine in Russia Is Reminder of the Obstacles at Google.

Earlier on Thursday, he told\n\n, \"This is a personal matter, and nothing has been proven yet.\"\n\nMayerson, who is representing Andrea, tells PEOPLE that his client believed she had been divorced for decades, and only learned that the marriage was not legally dissolved recently when she went to collect Social Security.\n\n\"Mr. Vereen told her years ago they were divorced,\" Mayerson explains. \"But when she applied for Social Security, she found out that not only are they not divorced, but that some other woman is collecting under his name.\"\n\nThat woman, Nancy Bruner, married Vereen in Los Angeles in 1976. They ultimately divorced in 2012. However, according to Mayerson, Vereen would have had to mention the date of his divorce on his California marriage certificate. \"That's what's fishy about this,\" says Mayerson.\n\nThe attorney adds that after Andrea discovered she was still married, he contacted Vereen's team to work out a solution. \"We were negotiating with them, and they really didn't want to give much of anything,\" he explains. \"And then they, inexplicably in my opinion, filed this lawsuit [for divorce].\"\n\nWhile Mayerson does not believe that Vereen is \"a bad guy,\" he hopes that the singer/dancer \"will respect the fact that this woman raised his son and do the right thing.\" He adds, \"He left this young girl \u2013 she was 14 and pregnant at the time \u2013 to raise a child by herself in New York City, which was not easy at the time for an African-American woman, and life was tough.\"\n\nThe attorney says that Vereen has a union pension, has not collected Social Security yet and earned as much as $400,000 last year alone. \"It's not as though he's impoverished,\" Mayerson explains. Andrea, one the other hand, he says, \"has lived exceptionally modestly her whole life. She's a religious women, was a pastor, worked in churches, sang in choirs and was scraping everywhere along the way with virtually no help from him.\"\n\nWhile Andrea's lawyer is confident that the judge will rule in her favor, he is still hopeful the parties will reach a settlement outside of court. \"We're hopeful there will be a settlement before we go to trial and that Mr. Vereen will come to his good senses and get this settled and have a great twilight to his career.\"\n\nVereen, now 69, won best actor in a musical at the 1973 Tonys for his portrayal of\n\nand has also appeared in numerous films and television series.",

        "text": "Vin Scully was impressed with me as a broadcaster \u2026 at least that's what he told me.\n\nIt has been 23 years since I shared a booth with the Dodgers' legendary broadcaster, who's calling it a career this week after 67 years on the job. But when you were in the presence of greatness, you tend to remember all the details.\n\nOn May 19, 1993, I was part of a team that delivered the first Mandarin Chinese broadcast from a Major League Baseball game.\n\nWhen the Dodgers faced the Cincinnati Reds that day at Dodger Stadium, four radio booths were occupied to air the game -- in English, Spanish, Korean and Chinese.\n\nI was just out of college at the time, working at the Pasadena Star-News. When a press release announcing the game would be broadcast in Chinese made its way to our newsroom, I jumped at the chance. I lobbied the radio station to bring me on (pro bono, of course) to be part of the announcing team, selling my ability as a fluent speaker of both English and Chinese as well as my \"expertise\" in baseball.\n\nIt worked. Thomas Kao, the original announcer who was a local talk show host, graciously asked me to be his sidekick. I bounded into Dodger Stadium that afternoon with unbridled enthusiasm. It wasn't that I hadn't covered a Dodgers game before, but this occasion was much different. It was historic, and I knew I'd get to share a booth with the Hall of Fame voice of the Dodgers.\n\nAs the game went on, I took over more of the play-by-play duties as Kao did the scene-setting. S.C. Chao and Jerry Sung, famous baseball players from Taiwan, were also in the booth as our color analysts. For a first-time group that's never worked together before, I thought we had pretty decent chemistry.\n\nThen Scully walked in at the end of the third inning. The way the Dodgers radio broadcasts were set up at the time, Vin did the first and last three innings of the game, with him taking a break in the middle innings. He'd spend the fourth inning with us.\n\nI was thrilled and nervous at the same time. I remember telling myself: \"Do not stutter!\"\n\nBut Scully was as gregarious and gracious in person as his listeners have come to know during a career that began in Brooklyn in 1950. He sat down between Kao and me and immediately put us at ease. He asked us some questions (with me translating for our Chinese audience) and I did some in return. At one point, I asked him to call a few pitches and plays for our listeners, and he happily obliged.\n\nAs the inning went on, I had the occasion to describe a near double-play ball started by Reds shortstop Barry Larkin. When I finished, Vin was effusive in his praise, telling me my call was \"terrific,\" even though he didn't speak Mandarin and probably didn't understand what I said besides \"Larkin.\" But his reaction was so enthusiastic and genuine, if I had died at that moment it would've been a life well lived.\n\nThat call ended up on an NBC News feature and was part of the highlights package on that night's ESPN SportsCenter. We also were visited in the booth by then-Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley. The team was delighted with the broadcast and invited us back for a few more that season. I returned for five more games, doing the broadcasts solo, including the season finale in which the Dodgers denied the 103-win San Francisco Giants a postseason berth with a 12-1 victory.\n\nMy radio broadcast career ended after that season, though I had agreed to a deal to do both Dodgers and Lakers games in Mandarin Chinese in 1994, even appearing at a joint press conference attended by both franchises. The radio station I worked for folded a few months later, and I took a newspaper job in San Francisco and headed north.\n\nBut I'll always have the rare honor of having shared a booth with the great Vin Scully, with memories flooding back as he wraps up his incomparable career this weekend in San Francisco. I've probably heard thousands of his broadcasts in my life, but of course I'll treasure that one inning while he sat side-by-side with me above all others.\n\nAs Scully was departing the booth after that inning, he flashed his familiar toothy grin and said to me, \"Mr. Chi, it's been a pleasure!\"\n\nNo, Mr. Scully, the pleasure was all mine.\n\n-- Samuel Chi is the managing editor of RealClearSports.com and proprietor of College Football Exchange.

        "text": "This summer, like most others, has been a pretty quiet one for the video game industry. Notable releases have been few and far between, and sales numbers haven't typically been eye-popping.\n\nWhen the clock struck 12 a.m., \"Madden NFL 09\" hit store shelves. Thousands of retailers around the country, including Best Buy (nyse: BBY - news - people ), Wal-Mart (nyse: WMT - news - people ) and GameStop (nyse: GME - news - people ), hosted launch parties for fans who couldn't wait until a more civilized hour of the morning to get their hands on the game.\n\nIt will likely sell between 2 million and 3 million copies within a month. By the end of the year, it's sure to be one of the industry's top 10 selling titles.\n\n\"Madden\" is to the gaming industry what the Macy's Thanksgiving parade is to retailers: the official start of the holiday season. Its release kicks off the avalanche of top-tier game releases that will continue through mid-December.\n\nIt's also the premier game in Electronic Arts' (nasdaq: ERTS - news - people ) catalog, selling more than 70 million copies in its history. Sports titles account for roughly a third of the game publisher's $3.7 billion fiscal 2008 revenues.\n\nWith \"Madden\" now in its 20th year, the publisher is pulling out all the stops. On Monday, EA hosted a massive celebration and launch event for the game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Fans were able to rub shoulders with former Madden cover athletes and see performances by some of the bands who have used the game's soundtrack as a launching pad for new singles, albums and, in some cases, careers. Good Charlotte and Busta Rhymes were among those scheduled to perform.\n\nDespite the hoopla surrounding the anniversary, analysts expect this year's \"Madden\" will have trouble topping sales of its predecessors. Colin Sebastian, senior vice president of equity research at Lazard Capital Markets, says he expects \"Madden NFL 09\" will sell roughly 4.5 million copies this fiscal year--more or less what the previous version sold last year.\n\n\"I would say the brand, to this day, is very important, but we saw a decline in sales last year, so there has been the concern that there are cracks in the foundation for EA Sports,\" he says.\n\nIt's not customer loyalty that's to blame. Football is the great equalizer in the video game world, reaching both the hard-core and casual gamer. \"Madden\" consistently has been the one title that appeals firmly to both.\n\nRather, it's the ongoing transition to the newest generation of consoles that's stunting growth. The PlayStation 2 has historically been an important part of Madden's sales base, and software sales for the platform are rapidly declining. As the Wii becomes the dominant hardware in the industry, third-party publishers haven't had much luck in capturing audience they did with the PS2. (EA hopes to attract that audience with a new feature that lets the game adapt to a player's skills.)\n\nNot that sales of 4.5 million are anything to sneeze at. Typically, any title that sells over a million copies is considered an overwhelming success.\n\nOther publishers, recognizing the strength of the Madden brand, act much the way movie studios do when a major release comes out in theaters: They stay out of the way. But after the Madden juggernaut primes the pump at retail, the free-for-all will begin for gamers' dollars.\n\nEA follows up \"Madden\" with the long-anticipated \"Spore\" from Will Wright, creator of \"The Sims,\" on Sept. 4. MTV is up next with \"Rock Band 2\" on Sept. 14. By November, Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ) and Sony (nyse: SNE - news - people ) will be duking it out with \"Gears of War 2\" and \"Resistance 2,\" respectively. Nintendo (other-otc: NTDOY.PK - news - people ), meanwhile, will offer up \"Animal Crossing: City Folk\". Other expected hit titles include \"Little Big Planet,\" \"Fallout 3\" and \"Left 4 Dead\".\n\nSome of these games may outsell this year's \"Madden.\" (And Take-Two Interactive Software's (nasdaq: TTWO - news - people ) \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" released earlier this year, certainly will.)\n\nDon't let a single year's sales numbers fool you, though. The Madden franchise, after 20 years, remains a consistent performer for EA--one the company can rely on. For all the pomp and circumstance that accompanies the release of a new \"Halo\" (or some other marquee title), these games can't compare to the numbers \"Madden\" turns in year after year.\n\nXbox + Netflix: Who's Next?",

A few steps away, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, construction has just begun, its bottom floors being measured with a ruler. And downstairs, the Roosevelt Island tram is slowly making its way through a test run.\n\nHalfway across the globe, workers in Beijing are creating another Great Wall of China, and in Buenos Aires, work is underway on the new Panama Canal.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of Gulliver\u2019s Gate, a miniature world that is being created by seven design teams in workshops around the world and will be brought together in a 49,000-square-foot exhibit space in Times Square. It is scheduled to open in April.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making something enormous, even though we\u2019re dealing with miniatures,\u201d Eiran Gazit, the chief executive of the project, said as he led a tour of the empty second floor of the building on West 44th Street (the old New York Times building), where the 1:87 scale models will be moved this fall. He pointed to pieces of green tape placed on the bare concrete floor. \u201cThis area here is Russia. You\u2019re actually standing on Siberia,\u201d he said. \u201cTowards that corner is the Middle East. Mecca. Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nMr. Gazit, who spent 14 years in the Israeli military, retired as a major. His second act was to build a 14-acre miniature version of Israel back in 1994 at 1:25 scale. It opened in 2003 near Latrun, in the Ayalon Valley of Israel. \u201cWhatever field I chose after the military, it had to be one without secrets,\u201d he said.\n\nHis miniatures are utopian. Gulliver\u2019s Gate will have a working airport, without terrorists. Model trains will run on time. There are no wars, no protests, no refugee camps \u2014 only tiny people going about their business amid landmarks of the world. Most of the 300 miniature models will represent the present. Some places will be re-creations of the past \u2014 like Chinatown and Little Italy, at the turn of the century. And some will envision the future. The model is not an exact replica of the world, just highlights.\n\nIn Hoboken, N.J., Washington is being built, without the bipartisan rancor. A mini-New York City, which is rising at Brooklyn Model Works, will include all the major tourist sites \u2014 the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the New York Public Library.\n\nThe builders hope to draw not only tourists to the $40 million project, but New Yorkers as well. \u201cWe want to give New Yorkers a good reason to go to Times Square,\u201d Mr. Gazit said.\n\nEach day, Mr. Gazit watches the progress of the work around the globe via a live stream, but he is leaving the design up to the different teams. \u201cI am not going to tell them what to show about their own places,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know much better than I do. I don\u2019t want an American interpretation of what life is like in Buenos Aires, for instance.\u201d\n\nMr. Gazit has 15 people on staff full time, and about 20 to 30 artists and designers working on each of the seven world sites.

Both men have performed feats of such impossible endurance in such extreme conditions that they literally have become scientific curiosities.\n\nNorth of the Arctic Circle, 51-year-old Wim Hof is running. The frozen tundra typically is reserved for polar bears, but Hof isn't running for his life. He is running for sport: 26 miles, half-naked, wearing just shorts and sandals in bone-chilling, minus-25-degree temperatures.\n\nThey are conditions that would kill any normal man -- but Hof is no ordinary mortal.

He's scaled Mount Everest, dived into the frigid waters beneath the North Pole and even turned himself into a human Popsicle -- immersing himself in ice for a record-setting 72 minutes, wearing only his signature shorts.\n\n\"It's almost beyond belief that someone, anyone, could live through that,\" said Dr. Ken Kamler, who specializes in extreme medicine. \"He's immersed in ice water.

(Ages 5 to 9)\n\nTHE STORY OF LITTLE BABAJI\n\nMichael di Capua Books/HarperCollins Publishers. $14.95.\n\nIn order to look at ''Sam and the Tigers'' and ''The Story of Little Babaji,'' many adults, and all of today's children, would be helped by a little bit of history. Madras in the summer of 1898 was no place for small girls of fair complexion -- especially since their father was busy investigating the causes of bubonic plague. Retreat to a villa in the hills was prudent, leaving Mother to divide her time between cool daughters and sweltering husband.\n\nTo keep the family's spirits up during her shuttle trips, Helen Bannerman turned to writing illustrated letters and telling homemade stories. Among the most successful of these was the tale of how Little Black Sambo bested a bunch of tigers who had tried to steal his clothes. She invented it on one of her train journeys down to Madras and made a little book out of it, which she illustrated and bound herself.\n\nIts success was not confined to the family, however. An English friend, due to return shortly to Britain, thought it ought to be published and volunteered to take the manuscript to London to negotiate a deal. Bannerman was not too keen on that, but with many injunctions against selling the copyright she let the little treasure go.\n\nAnd that was the last she saw of it, and almost the last direct connection she had with it. For her hapless friend fell in with the monocled publisher Grant Richards, and ''The Story of Little Black Sambo'' was spirited out of her grasp to be published in 1899 as the fourth volume in his Dumpy Books series. He bought the whole thing for just 5.\n\nHaving obtained the copyright, Richards then failed to protect it in the United States, and it wasn't long before the stateside predators moved in. The simple story, so well fitted for the dynamics of storytelling or the pages of a picture book, and costing nothing, was like a present, and ''Little Black Sambo'' soon began a trans-Atlantic career in magazines, in storybooks and in a host of unauthorized editions with rewritten texts and recast illustrations.\n\nOddly enough, the same thing was to happen a year or two later when Messrs. Frederick Warne forgot to copyright ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in the United States; but where Beatrix Potter's work was merely devitalized or vulgarized, ''Little Black Sambo'' had a harder time. Having begun life in India as an innocent companion to two homesick girls, it became, 60 years later, one of the principal miscreants accused of bringing racism into children's literature.\n\nAs far as Bannerman's hero was concerned, the main charges were his offensive name (along with that of Black Mumbo, his mother, and Black Jumbo, his father) and their cheerful but crude depiction in Bannerman's illustrations. Subsidiary charges related to a kind of illegal immigrant status, since the characters in the pictures appeared to be African while the setting, with its tigers and its ghee, was clearly Indian, and there was also trouble over Sambo's gross behavior in eating no fewer than 169 pancakes. Guilt by association was reflected back from the multiplicity of -- usually frightful -- unauthorized editions, and Sambo became a pariah.\n\nNow, however, as the boy approaches his 100th birthday, a rehabilitation begins. With great generosity of spirit, Julius Lester recognizes in his notes to ''Sam and the Tigers'' that Helen Bannerman's unpretentious tale ''transcended its stereotypes.'' ''What other story,'' he asks, ''had I read at the age of 7 and remembered for 50 years?'' Where lay the secret but in the story's ''truth of the imagination''?\n\nThus, with Jerry Pinkney, with whom he has also collaborated on versions of the Uncle Remus stories and a life of John Henry, Mr. Lester has fashioned a new telling, expanding the story and narrating it in a ''Southern black storytelling voice.'' Concurrently, Mr. Pinkney has converted the ''mythical quality'' of Bannerman's illustrations into pages filled with action.",

The German sports brand's proposed new shoes feature orange rubber shackles fixed to the back of the sneaker that can be attached around the ankle. The sneakers have since been dubbed the \"shackle shoes\" after rousing fury for its racist connotation.\n\nAdidas faced a furious backlash over its shackle shoes, or the JS Roundhouse Mids, from those who accused the brand of racism.\n\n\"The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive,\" wrote Reverend Jesse Jackson, for the Huffington Post. \"Removing the chains from our ankles and placing them on our shoes is no progress.\n\n\"For Adidas to promote the athleticism and contributions of a variety of African-American sports legends -- especially Olympic heroes Wilma Rudolph and Jesse Owens and boxing great Muhammad Ali -- and then allow such a degrading symbol of African-American history to pass through its corporate channels and move toward actual production and advertisement, is insensitive and corporately irresponsible.\"\n\nAlthough Adidas initially defended the designer of the shackle shoes, Jeremy Scott, as having a \"quirky\" and \"lighthearted\" vision, the company turned around and announced it would pull the sneakers from its line, according to CNN.\n\n\"The design of the JS Roundhouse Mid is nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery,\" the statement from Adidas said. \"We apologize if people are offended by the design and we are withdrawing our plans to make them available in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe photo still remains posted on Adidas' official Facebook page and, at the time of this posting, has more than 38,000 \"likes\" and almost 4,000 comments.\n\n\"I'm very glad Adidas has decided not to sell this shoe,\" commented one Facebook user. \"If you can't see how adding shackles to a pair of basketball sneakers is demeaning, you can't see much at all. Leaving that argument aside, these are not only butt ugly, but they were set to retail for THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. That's outrageous, given they have no function beyond making wearers look foolish.\"\n\n\"If any of you study the psychological effects of bondage in relation to any group of people or thing experiencing it under just or unjust conditions, studies show it's used to create fear, restrict and effect negatively the mental, physical and spiritual growth of the subject,\" commented another. \"But when man gets farther and farther away from true knowledge of self he begans [sic] to accept being treated like and animal and you can then sell him chains and bondage without resistane [sic].\"\n\n\"Forget the slavery angle for a moment -- why orange?\" asked another. \"Prison orange. Is prison an attractive concept now? 2/3 or more are filled with African American men. Is that the new cool... the new dope for un-incarcerated men, to emulate locked-up brothers by wearing symbols of their grief?\n\nOthers thought that the issue has been extremely overblown.\n\n\"Everyone equating these shoes with slavery are the true racists,\" wrote a Facebook user underneath the photo of Adidas' shackle shoes. \"They are the ones perpetuating stereotypes and are the reason this kind of talk is even an issue anymore. I hope Adidas reconsiders their decision to pull these from shelves and tells these offended people to go pound sand.\"\n\n\"People of all 'races' wear Adidas,\" commented another. \"Why do we have to jump to the conclusion that these are meant for a particular people group?\"\n\nAdidas is not the first sneaker brand to offend this year.\n\nNike announced plans to celebrate St. Patrick's Day 2012 with the release of the \"Nike SB Black and Tan Quickstrike\" to commemorate the Irish holiday. According to the Belfast Telegraph, Nike intended for \"Black and Tan\" to refer to the St. Patrick's Day drink made of a mix of stout and lager, usually Guinness and Harp. The sneaker was set to be released as part of a beer-inspired series, including the \"Nike SB Dunk High 'Guinness'\" colored black like the Ireland-brewed beer, ahead of St. Patrick's Day.\n\nHowever, \"Black and Tan\" was also the name of the British paramilitary unit who brutally attacked Irish citizens in the 1920s to quell revolutions against British rule, reported the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nThe Black and Tans, otherwise known simply as \"the Tans,\" killed and destroyed on a large scale, reported the Irish publication. \"When a Tan was killed in Cork, they burnt down more than 300 buildings,\" added the paper. The Catholic cardinal at one time referred to them as \"a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves.\"\n\nWhat do you think of the Adidas \"shackle shoes\" controversy -- is it rooted in racism or is it completely groundless?\n\nThePostGame brings you the most interesting sports stories on the web.\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter to read them first!",

Tax rates for the wealthiest two percent would go up immediately.\n\nTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at the U.S. Capitol for meetings with congressional leaders November 29, 2012.\n\nThe offer, according to Republicans, would also include $50 billion in stimulus spending in the form of infrastructure projects, an extension of unemployment benefits and a extension of the two percent payroll tax break.\n\nThe White House would also like to avoid future fights over raising the debt ceiling by taking it out of Congress altogether. While Congress could act to block a debt limit increase, it would not be necessary for Congress to approve one.\n\nOne Republican aide expressed outrage that the White House would ask for that with no reforms attached at all. Earlier today, Boehner said, that \"there is a lot of things that I have wanted in my life but almost all of them had a price tag attached to them.\n\n\"If we're going to talk about the debt limit in this, then there is going to be some price tag associated with it.\"\n\nDemocrats have been equally critical of Republicans in negotiations so far saying that Republicans have not put a real revenue offer on the table since they have not said how much money they'd be willing to put to the deficit through tax revenue.\n\n\"Right now, the only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates,\" Deputy White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a written statement.\n\n\"The President has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts and we remain willing to do tough things to compromise, and it's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices - from the business community to middle class Americans across the country - who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.\"\n\nDespite the appearance of talks breaking down today, Boehner said he's still optimistic a deal can be reached.\n\nThe White House's Nabors also seemed determined to keep talking.\n\n\"We're going to keep working with folks just like we have been and, you know, we'll make progress.\"",

The results do not hold as much significance as the ones administered later this year by the Federal Reserve, but they were notable. For the first time since the financial crisis, the stress tests showed that, at a number of banks, a key measure of readiness for the next crisis had dropped.\n\nCitigroup C , for instance, said its tier one capital ratio\u2014the amount of money a bank has on hand to cover loan and investment losses\u2014would drop to 8.4% in another severe downturn. That\u2019s down from 9.1% a year ago. At Morgan Stanley MS , capital levels could fall to 8.9%, down from 9.5% a year ago. Wells Fargo WFC dipped to 9.6% from 9.9%. And JPMorgan Chase JPM said it would have enough capital after a stress scenario to cover losses on 8.4% of its remaining risky assets, down from 8.5% a year ago.\n\nGoldman Sachs GS was the only bank that came out looking better than it did last year, 10.4% versus 8.9%. Bank of America\u2019s BAC results were the same as they were last year.\n\nThe drops are relatively small. And the banks are still far more prepared for a downturn than they were before the last recession. But the banks have spent much of the past six years socking away extra cash to make them look as safe as possible. Now, the pendulum is swinging back.\n\nBut there were signs of that already. About a month ago, the FDIC reported that, as of mid-year, banks had boosted lending by nearly $400 billion in the past 12 months, the biggest jump since late 2008. Also, at the end of the second quarter, JPMorgan reported that it was taking increased risk on its trading desk. It appeared to be one of the few banks to do so. But the others are likely to follow. The banks will report new risk numbers a few weeks from now, along with their earnings reports.\n\nAlready, some regulators are getting nervous. Bank regulators have warned a number of banks about a return to risky lending. And the Fed is contemplating new rules that would require the big banks to continue to add to their capital piles.\n\nRemember, though, all of this renewed risk is good for the economy. While the Fed is telling banks not to take too much risk, its low interest rate policy is intended to get banks to lend more and, well, take more risk. And the fact that banks are lending more means the Fed\u2019s efforts have been, at least partly, a success.\n\nRegulators and the rest of us should not want the risk-taking pendulum to swing in just one direction. The question is whether the rules passed in the wake of the financial crisis will stop it from swinging too far back in the wrong direction.",

The problem for enthusiasts of the virtual currency is that not only will they have to give the Feds a chunk of whatever capital gains they realize on their bitcoin holdings, the taxation of bitcoin as a currency will also constitute a serious hurdle for its widespread use.\n\nBitcoin, by design, is deflationary. After the 21 millionth bitcoin is mined, no more will ever be created. This distinguishes it from both fiat currencies, like the dollar, and even gold, the supplies of which grow over time. The problem is that as the economy and productivity grow, bitcoin will naturally become more valuable, creating a psychological incentive for people to hold onto rather than spend their bitcoin. This doesn\u2019t disqualify bitcoin from being a widely used currency, but it is an impediment.\n\nMORE: Gold vs. bitcoin: An apocalyptic showdown\n\nAnd now that the IRS has officially said that it will tax it as property, there\u2019s just one more speed bump in the road to bitcoin\u2019s world domination. After all, taxpayers only have to cut the government in on their gains after they sell their assets, a stricture which happens to promote broadly beneficial behavior like long-term investing. It\u2019s not such a great tax treatment, however, for a young currency that many expect to steadily increase in value but is also trying to achieve widespread use as a currency. In other words, the capital gains tax is an incentive for bitcoin users to hold onto, rather then spend, their bitcoins.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve written earlier, the IRS\u2019s tax treatment of bitcoin has embedded in it the irony that your bitcoin tax bill will be directly proportional to the dollar\u2019s inflation.

It fuels the world\u2019s workforce, with more than 1.3bn cups consumed around the world every day according to coffee researchers Allegra Strategies.\n\nMore than 1.3bn cups are consumed around the world every day\n\nYet unlike wine sommeliers, the baristas making and serving your skinny, frothy, cappuccino or latte haven\u2019t always been taken seriously. Working in the coffee industry has been thought of as an in-between job, something you\u2019d do to get you through college or help bolster the sporadic income from an acting career. For decades, working in coffee was a stopgap on the way to another, more important career goal. Things however are changing.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge business - Allegra has calculated that cups drunk out of the home account for sales of around $60bn -$80bn per year globally and the coffee industry is now considered a viable career option in itself. Speciality coffee shops employ workers who are passionate about their trade and see it as an end in itself, not a route to their dream career. Poke your head into a fancy coffee joint in New York, Sydney or Singapore and the chances are you\u2019ll be served by someone who waxes lyrical about their latest beans in the same way as a craft brewer eulogises on a favourite ale.\n\nYou\u2019ll be served by someone who waxes lyrical about their latest beans\n\nYou won\u2019t be earning an investment banker\u2019s salary. In 2014 the Speciality Coffee Association of America found that, on average, baristas in speciality coffee shops in the US earned $22,000 a year basic salary. With an industry certification this salary rose to $24,500. Make the next step to become a roaster and you can expect on average $38,000, rising to nearly $40,000 with a certification. Baristas can also use their expertise to get a well-paid job in equipment sales and product sourcing.\n\nGlobally there are 40,000 professional baristas according to coffee research specialists, Allegra Strategies. Throw senior chain store baristas and senior brewers into the mix and the number swells to 200,000 in the US alone. Big chains such as Starbucks still account for the majority of coffee shops \u2013 a staggering 45,000 worldwide including 22,000 outlets but there are a sizeable number of independents; around 1,200 in the US and 450 in the UK.\n\nLondon, for its part, is an independent coffee shop hot spot. In the heart of Fitzrovia, a trendy, enclave north of the frenetic hub, Oxford Street is a plethora of high-end joints so certain of their value to espresso drinkers that the presence of coffee behemoths seemingly on every street corner, doesn\u2019t worry them.\n\n\u201cIf a rival opens five doors down, it makes us focus even more on what we offer,\u201d said Peter Dore-Smith, owner of coffee shop, Kaffeine. \u201cWe need to make sure our coffee, our food, our service, our atmosphere make our place somewhere people want to hang out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that go-getting attitude that marks out small independent outlets as the industry pioneers. Among the big drivers of the rise of \u2018barista craft\u2019 worldwide are international coffee competitions. In 2000 the inaugural World Barista Championships were held in Monte Carlo and since then it\u2019s spawned a host of other events globally.\n\nGareth Jones is the manager of the Fitzrovia branch of Workshop Coffee, a small chain. He takes his job and the chance to show off his skills in competitions, very seriously. But whilst winning is a bonus, the taking part is, in some ways, more important\n\n\u201cBaristas from around the world can get together, discuss ideas and move the industry forward. Competitions push you to improve, raise the quality and focus on the finer details.\u201d\n\nTaking the job seriously also brings financial rewards. Gareth earns around \u00a325,000 ($37,000) a year and down the road, Claire Brice manager of Kaffeine boasts a salary of \u00a332,000 ($48,000). Winning one of the big competitions can also mean thousands of dollars in equipment, trips abroad and of course the prestige of being the best.\n\nIt\u2019s this change in attitude and expectation which has helped elevate the barista trade from a fill-in job for college students to a caffeine-fuelled career.\n\nDo you have what it takes to be a coffee hot shot?

For others he is a canny manipulator, utterly in control of his reputation and place in the art world and market. For others still, he is all these things: an artist who outdoes even Andy Warhol in his ubiquity, his nimbleness at self-promotion and his use of every medium at his disposal to promulgate his work and his activism.\n\nWhatever your views on the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, one thing is clear: he is everywhere, from the Hampstead theatre in London, where Howard Brenton's play about the 81 days Ai spent in detention in 2011 is underway, to the web, where his the video for his heavy metal song Dumbass is circulating, to the Venice Biennale, where not one but three of his large-scale works are on display \u2013 perhaps the most exposure for any single artist at the international festival.\n\nOne of the works, Bang, a forest of hundreds of tangled wooden stools, is the most prominent piece in the German national pavilion. Then, in the Zuecca Project Space on the island of Giudecca, is his installation Straight: 150 tons of crushed rebar from schools flattened in the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, recovered by the artist and his team, who bought the crumpled steel rods as scrap before painstakingly straightening them and piling them up in a wave-like sculptural arrangement.\n\nBy far the most revealing about Ai's own experience, though, is the third piece, SACRED. Situated in the church of Sant'Antonin, it consists of six large iron boxes, into which visitors can peek to see sculptures recreating scenes from the artist's detention. Here is a miniature Ai being interrogated; here a miniature Ai showers or sits on the lavatory while two uniformed guards stand over him. Other scenes show him sleeping and eating \u2013 always in the same tiny space, always under double guard. (The music video refers to some of these scenes with a lightly satirical tone that is absent from the sculpture.)\n\nAccording to Greg Hilty of London's Lisson Gallery, under whose auspices SACRED is being shown, and who saw Ai in China a week ago, the work is a form of \"therapy or exorcism \u2013 it was something he had to get out. It is an experience that we might see as newsworthy, but for him, he was the one in it.\"\n\nThe uncanny hyperreality of the installation speaks of the fact that, according to the project's curator, Maurizio Bortolotti, \"the experience made him fix all the details like a nightmare\". For 81 days, said Hilty, he had nothing to do (aside from his periods being questioned) but memorise the minutest details of the tiny, featureless room in which he was kept. The outside of the metal boxes is entirely blank \u2013 Ai was brought there hooded. The only detail of the cell's exterior he observed was on his release, when he saw the number on the door: 1135.\n\nThe ecclesiastical setting, the title of the work, the appearance of the metal crates (which might resemble a reliquary or saint's coffin) suggest that Ai is positioning himself as a martyr. According to Hilty, however, \"He is not pretending to be a saint, but the setting does suggest things such as the stations of the cross, or the temptations of St Anthony, to whom the church is dedicated. But these are human, universal things that go beyond Ai Weiwei \u2026 he's not saying he's a saint, or that he is wholly right or good. He's just being honest.\n\n\"There is a reflex among artworld people that if he is strong as an activist you can't see him as an artist,\" Hilty added. \"But Ai shows a remarkable knack for working in different registers.\" The sculpture at the Venice Biennale should be seen as entirely different from the pop video, the blogging, the activism and the rest, Hilty suggested. \"He could be dismissed as a polemicist, an activist. But I hope people see these works and recognise that he can do all that and also step back and make art with profundity.\"",

A group of these vulnerable Democratic senators recently signed a letter to embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asking that the March 31st open enrollment deadline for Obamacare get pushed back.\n\nRepublicans in the House, meanwhile, may seek to increase the pressure this week by again voting to delay the mandate for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Calls for an individual mandate delay, fiercely opposed by the administration, will likely becoming overwhelming if the federal website is not functioning seamlessly by Dec. 1. Even if the mandate is delayed, the millions of young, healthy and currently uninsured people the law depends on to make the economics work could ultimately decide paying the penalty is better than buying insurance. That could spark a \"death spiral\" for the law, an outcome that would be devastating for the Obama presidency and Democrats hopes in 2014 and beyond.\n\nThe hearings begin on Tuesday but the main event comes Wednesday when Sebelius squares off against Republicans at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing.

The suspension also covers the postseason.\n\nRodriguez originally received a 211-game suspension from MLB in August due to his alleged ties to Biogenesis, an anti-aging clinic in South Florida which supplied performance-enhancing drugs. A number of high-profile players were suspended for their involvement in the scandal, including Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz, and Jhonny Peralta, but Rodriguez received the biggest penalty of them all, allegedly for interfering with MLB's investigation.\n\n(Read more: Elite athletes born all 'roided up: Data on books)\n\nWhile the other players connected to Biogenesis immediately accepted their suspensions, Rodriguez appealed and was able to finish out the season. Following a contentious arbitration process, Horowitz did not uphold the original ban, but this should be considered a major victory for MLB and commissioner Bud Selig. It is still the longest suspension under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention & Treatment Program. Guillermo Mota previously received a 100-game suspension in 2012.\n\nThe other big winner today, at least from a financial perspective, is the Yankees, who will no longer have Rodriguez's salary ($25 million) on the books for the 2014 season. They have a very good chance to keep their payroll under $189 million even if they sign Japanese right-hander Masahiro Tanaka.\n\n(Read more: Firms show off gadgets for drivers, parents, athletes)\n\nBelow is a statement from Alex Rodriguez, who intends to take his fight against MLB to federal court:\n\n\"The number of games sadly comes as no surprise, as the deck has been stacked against me from day one. This is one man's decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not involve me having failed a single drug test, is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the Joint Drug Agreement and the Basic Agreement, and relies on testimony and documents that would never have been allowed in any court in the United States because they are false and wholly unreliable. This injustice is MLB's first step toward abolishing guaranteed contracts in the 2016 bargaining round, instituting lifetime bans for single violations of drug policy, and further insulating its corrupt investigative program from any variety defense by accused players, or any variety of objective review.\n\nI have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I will take this fight to federal court. I am confident that when a Federal Judge reviews the entirety of the record, the hearsay testimony of a criminal whose own records demonstrate that he dealt drugs to minors, and the lack of credible evidence put forth by MLB, that the judge will find that the panel blatantly disregarded the law and facts, and will overturn the suspension. No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with, and I am exhausting all options to ensure not only that I get justice, but that players' contracts and rights are protected through the next round of bargaining, and that the MLB investigation and arbitration process cannot be used against others in the future the way it is currently being used to unjustly punish me.",

This is a continuation of a policy that meant one in three phone calls to the Medicare, Centrelink and child support agencies went unanswered last financial year, 22m calls missed in total.\n\n\u201cPrevious efficiency dividends contributed to the government cutting almost 18,000 jobs since 2013.\n\n\u201cThese cuts have done enormous damage, like 4,400 positions being slashed from the tax office, a completely illogical policy given the number of multinational companies and mega rich individuals who aren\u2019t paying their fair share of tax.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why should you care about striking public servants?

Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat advice would you give your 22-year-old self today?\u201d is written by Michael Leabman, founder and CTO of Energous.\n\nLet me start out by saying I have a lot of advice for my 22-year-old self. But the most important parts are actually the same pieces of advice that I would give to anyone starting out\u2013whether that\u2019s a young entrepreneur or my own kids. For me, these life lessons translated into the achievement of a dream\u2013cheesy, but true: the creation of my own company. Here\u2019s to hoping they are valuable to others as well.\n\nMake your parents nervous It\u2019s never too early to follow your dreams. Over the years, I realized that my biggest mistakes were the result of not following my instincts or taking enough risks. It wasn\u2019t until I turned 30 that I started pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and consciously taking more chances. Early on, one of the biggest deliberate risks was trading in a stable position for a $0 salary. I wish I could say that everyone was supportive, and while my parents were, others said it would be impossible. In the end, following my gut led me to where I am today.\n\nSurround yourself with smart people You don\u2019t need to have all the answers to accomplish your end goal\u2013all you need to have is the vision and the passion to seek out the unknown. Whether it\u2019s family, friends, a business partner, or mentor (both personal and professional), surround yourself with people who can act as a sounding board or share valuable insights into challenging areas that you might not have expertise in. These people can help guide your ideas and provide support at various levels, which can prove tremendously valuable.\n\nKnow when to stop listening and follow your heart While it\u2019s helpful, and even critical, to subject yourself and your idea to the opinions and recommendations of other smart people, it\u2019s important to take all advice with a grain of salt. Consider, for example, if the person is truly staying within the bounds of their expertise, or if they have perhaps tried and failed at your vision using another approach. Challenges will happen frequently and you will cross paths with people who are non-believers, but doing something that you are passionate about makes it much easier to overcome obstacles you encounter along the way. For me, this advantage naturally pushes me towards solving a problem, as opposed to letting it upset me. I am thankful that I wake up every day and work on my dream.\n\nLearn from your experiences Last but not least, and one of the most valuable pieces of advice I can give is to realize that your first endeavor might not be successful\u2013and accept that from the beginning. Deliberately choosing to take more risks means you are also acknowledging that failure is a possibility, but realizing that without taking the risk you won\u2019t reap the benefits. The trick is to also commit to learning from your mistakes. For me, each career move is a stepping stone to something better. From your first job to your dream job and everything in between, there\u2019s value to be gained at every level, so embrace the small things and don\u2019t be afraid to push yourself outside of your comfort zone.

        "text": "There is no question the United States has achieved a moral victory by finding and killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. More practically, the implications relating to geopolitical risk are much less certain. While some would argue that killing the head of al Qaeda is a positive development, there is also a credible case to be made that this action could potentially accelerate terrorist activity if bin Laden is perceived as a martyr by his brethren.\n\nIn assessing the impact of the death of bin Laden, it is important to note that he has been on the run from U.S. Special Forces for almost a decade. While figuratively bin Laden remained the head of al Qaeda, there is no doubt that being on the run reduced his effectiveness from an operational leadership perspective. With the entire CIA looking for him and a massive award on his head, bin Laden realistically didn\u2019t have the capability to micro manage al Qaeda operations. Therefore it is unlikely that the killing of bin Laden will dramatically reduce the threat from al Qaeda in the short term.\n\nStepping back for a moment, it is also important to note that the very nature and organization of al Qaeda remains very much in question. There are some analysts that question whether al Qaeda is as organized as is often portrayed by the press. In fact, as Marc Sagemen, a former CIA agent based in Islamabad, and author of Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, wrote:\n\n\u201cThere is no umbrella organization. We like to create a mythical entity called al-Qaeda in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with.\u201d\n\nThis is a controversial position and is widely disputed, but the reality is that al Qaeda is most certainly not organized akin to a Western criminal organization with specific command and control functions.\n\nTo this point, as of 2004, it was estimated that almost two-thirds of the senior leadership of al Qaeda had either been captured or killed. If this were a typical American crime family, it would be safe to assume the family would be out of business. This has not been the case for al Qeada. In fact, the July 2005 London bombings purportedly occurred without specific leadership from abroad. Conversely, the 2009 plot by three Londoners to detonate seven bombs on airliners bound for North America was tied directly to al Qaeda. These actions suggest that al Qaeda is alive and well despite this loss of \u201cleadership.\u201d\n\nWhile al Qaeda, as led by bin Laden, may have once provided funding or training for some of these groups, currently many them, as characterized by the 2005 London bombings, likely work largely independently. In fact, while bin Laden had at one time bankrolled al Qaeda, his ability over the past decade to do so was limited by the fact that he was cut off from the family fortune; and even if he still had some independent wealth, moving those funds would have likely given U.S. operatives information as to his whereabouts.\n\nConceptually, bin Laden\u2019s key role over the past decade seemed to have been to fan the flames of discord against the United States, and the Western world generally. In this effort, he was certainly successful and the al Qaeda network will likely need to fill this vacuum.\n\nUltimately, the real legacy of bin Laden is the hundreds of thousands of operatives that have been trained in al Qaeda terrorist camps. In fact, Gary Bernsten, a former senior ranking CIA official, and author of Jawbreaker, has estimated this number to be as high as 800,000. Despite the death of bin Laden, this large group of like-minded Islamic terrorists continues to exist.\n\nIt is also important to note that, based on the evidence, al Qaeda activities are typically planned years in advance of when they are actually intended to occur. Therefore, even if bin Laden were more directly involved in orchestrating broader terrorist activities of the al Qaeda network than we believe he was, it is still not likely that any potential attacks currently in the pipeline would necessarily be thrown off course. The primary example of this process is the September 11th attacks in the United States. According to reports, the idea for these attacks was germinated in 1996 and planning began in 1998, which was a full three years before they occurred.\n\nNot surprisingly, equity markets, as a proxy of investors\u2019 propensity to accept more risk, have completely shaken off any potential positive impact of bin Laden\u2019s death. This is partially because of the points outlined above, which suggest that killing bin Laden likely won\u2019t halt terrorist activity in the intermediate term, but also because there is real potential that bin Laden\u2019s death accelerates terrorist activity on the basis of avenging bin Laden. In fact, Hamas started stirring such emotions by stating the following in a press release:\n\n\u201cWe condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior. We ask God to offer him mercy with the true believers and the martyrs.\u201d\n\nWe certainly won\u2019t suggest that the world is not a better place with the death of bin Laden, but it is not quite clear that is a safer place, or that geopolitical risk premiums should be reset lower as a result. While the head of the serpent has been cut off, the snake is still very much alive.",

        "text": "October 11 is National Coming Out Day in the United States, and it's widely celebrated in America's LGBTQ community as an opportunity to share individual coming-out stories as well as to reflect on social gains.\n\nBut in more than 70 countries around the world, coming out isn't always worth celebrating (yet). In the nations that criminalize LGBTQ people, coming out\u2014or being forcibly outed\u2014can result in banishment, jail or even death. T\u00e9a Braun, Legal Director at the Human Dignity Trust, said Coming Out Day stands as a reminder that there's still a long way to go.\n\n\"Coming out is still a life and death question in many places around the world,\" Braun told NBC OUT. \"LGBT people continue to be arrested, prosecuted, lashed, raped, forced or coerced into straight marriages, assaulted and murdered if their identity is known or suspected.\"\n\nAfter the 2015 Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S. and a string of federal policy changes that have made schools and healthcare providers more LGBTQ-inclusive, some Americans may feel as if the battle has been won. But in countries like Uganda, the past few years\u2014with increasing LGBTQ visibility and trends toward acceptance worldwide\u2014have been worse than ever.\n\nAn April 2016 report published by Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) showed that violent crimes and police and government harassment against the LGBTQ community increased after the country passed a vicious Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2014. The law has since been overturned by a court, but its intended consequences (life imprisonment for gay sex) have increased stigmatization of Uganda's LGBTQ community.\n\nBraun said that international policy is trending toward LGBTQ equality, with Belize, Seychelles, Mozambique, Nauru and Palau recently decriminalizing homosexuality. But as a smattering of nations slowly drop laws that send LGBTQ people to jail or death row, the situation remains dire for many elsewhere.\n\nComing out is particularly risky in Islamic nations in the Middle East, where the majority of countries either have laws on the books that punish homosexuality with the death penalty (whether or not the penalty is enforced), or where executions frequently occur despite no specific law mandating them. According to the International Lesbian and Gay Association's (ILGA) 2016 report State-Sponsored Homophobia, those nations include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Daesh/the Islamic State (which is not recognized as a country).\n\nThere's a certain Catch-22, though, to visibility and coming out in countries that criminalize LGBTQ populations.\n\n\"Visibility is key for the advancement of LGBTI human rights,\" ILGA Executive Director Renato Sabbadini told NBC OUT via email. \"Most people are more likely to understand the discrimination LGBTI people face and empathise with them if they realize that the LGBTI acronym is used not to refer to an empty abstraction\u2014but to identify a set of real people, including their children, relatives, friends or colleagues.\"\n\nSabbadini was referring specifically to the findings of ILGA's Global Attitudes Survey on LGBTI People, conducted in partnership with the television network LOGO. The 2016 survey found that 34 percent of respondents had become more accepting of LGBTQ people in the past five years, reporting that their favorable attitude shifts were a direct result of knowing an LGBTQ person. The numbers show that just by being out, an LGBTQ person can instigate social change starting with their own communities.\n\nBut even when being LGBTQ isn't punishable by death or life imprisonment at the hands of your government, it's not always safe to be out. Stan Ibrahim is a Kuwaiti transgender man who publishes the world's only Arabic-language transgender magazine. He shared his own coming-out story with NBC OUT, explaining that while being LGBTQ can get you sent to jail in Kuwait, \"at least you won't be killed or beheaded.\"\n\n\"I thought that being a transsexual is to have a mental illness that will go away after going to a psychologist,\" Ibrahim wrote in English in a direct Twitter message on Tuesday. He said he started to come out as transgender at age 14, and his parents were shocked\u2014insisting that it is a phase that will end by the time he graduates college later this year.\n\nIn the U.S., the transgender community struggled for years to not be seen as mentally ill. The removal of Gender Identity Disorder from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 was celebrated as a step toward destigmatizing the community. But in Kuwait, as in many Middle Eastern countries, transgender people are struggling to have gender difference accepted as a mental health status\u2014because then, at least, it might be treated as a fixed human condition rather than as a depraved choice.\n\nKuwait currently criminalizes transgender people under a 2007 law that bans \"imitating the opposite sex.\" Ironically, the law makes no provision for Gender Identity Disorder\u2014a medical condition recognized by the country's Ministry of Health. As a result, according to Human Rights Watch, transgender women in particular are arrested and abused by police on a regular basis.\n\nApart from the frequent arrests, Ibrahim said that being LGBTQ in Kuwait is marked by constant bullying, harassment, and mockery from family and peers.\n\n\"[My father is] driving me to college every day, and every day he mocks my hair and my dress,\" Ibrahim said. \"So he is my number one bully.\"\n\n\"Religious families take their LGBT children to a cleric or sheikh. And of course they'll be punished, they'll face a lot of physical violence,\" Ibrahim explained. \"Parents won't let their daughters and sons become your friend. And if anyone saw you hanging out as queer or LGBT, they have the right to litigate you. And the law stands by them.\"\n\nDespite the hardships, though, Ibrahim told NBC OUT he's glad he came out\u2014even if it meant potentially risking his family, friends and even his life.\n\n\"Staying closeted is worse,\" Ibrahim said. \"You'll hate yourself and you'll be ashamed of who you are. I don't accept being marginalized.\"\n\nFollow NBC OUT on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.",

They\u2019ve spent the last decade in court trying to get it back.\n\nThe Bakers built the voice recognition software company Dragon Systems from scratch and eventually sold it for $580 million to a Dutch company, Lernout & Hauspie, in 2000. Just two months later, news accounts detailed bogus international sales that had boosted the buyer\u2019s financial statements. Soon, the entire business collapsed in a bankrupt heap.\n\nThe Bakers, who took their $300 million share of proceeds entirely in Lernout & Hauspie stock, lost everything when the company failed.\n\nEver since, the couple and others have sued everyone in sight: accountants, commercial bankers who did business with Lernout & Hauspie and the Dutch company\u2019s investment banker. They\u2019ve recovered about $70 million settling those lawsuits.\n\nNow a jury is about to hear the Bakers\u2019 last big case \u2014 perhaps their biggest \u2014 against the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Jury selection is scheduled to start Monday in US District Court in Boston for a trial expected to last about five weeks.\n\nThe complaint in a nutshell: You should have figured out those guys were crooks.\n\nGoldman acted as the adviser to Dragon Systems in its merger negotiations and \u2014 by the Bakers\u2019 account \u2014 did a stunningly bad job. Alan Cotler, a Philadelphia lawyer representing the Bakers, says the couple \u2014 true pioneers in voice recognition technology \u2014 lost more than just money.\n\n\u201cJim and Janet Baker spent about 25 years of their lives creating Dragon to realize their dream of having millions of people use computers and other devices that understand human speech,\u201d says Cotler, who was in Boston Thursday preparing for the trial.\n\n\u201cGoldman Sachs played a fundamental role in the Bakers losing all that,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, speech recognition is being used throughout the world, and its best and most productive applications are still to come.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs you would expect, the investment bank doesn\u2019t see it that way. Goldman says it \u201cperformed its assignment satisfactorily in all respects.\u201d It said the Baker claims \u201care completely without merit.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know who has the better legal case, and the Bakers certainly made some odd, regrettable decisions along the way. But their Wall Street advisers fell far short in advising Dragon Systems on a sale to a buyer that newspaper reports uncovered as a fraud just months after closing (The Wall Street Journal simply called purported L&H customers and discovered they weren\u2019t doing business with the company).\n\nSurely no one familiar with Dragon Systems in its earliest days could have ever imagined how the story would unfold.\n\nThe Bakers were serious technology professionals who became bootstrap entrepreneurs in the 1980s, building a company around their voice recognition technology without the help of venture capitalists. Later, when they needed money to grow a successful business, they sold stock to disk drive maker Seagate Technology.\n\nIn fact, voice recognition was starting to attract the attention of much bigger technology companies. As the 1990s came to an end, conversation at Dragon Systems shifted from selling shares to selling the company.\n\nThe company hired Goldman in December of 1999 as an adviser. The transaction was small potatoes for Goldman, worth $5 million in fees. But it was the deal of a lifetime for the Bakers, and it went south in a hurry.\n\nI don\u2019t know why Dragon Systems\u2019 directors didn\u2019t get a formal fairness opinion about the sale proposal from Goldman \u2014 a point the investment bankers raise in their legal defense. I also don\u2019t know if it would have mattered.\n\nHanded a pile of stock, I can\u2019t explain why the sellers didn\u2019t use common financial strategies to hedge some of the risk. The Bakers still would have lost control of their technology, but much or all of their fortune might have been preserved.\n\nThe voice recognition technology acquired by Lernout & Hauspie was sold with other \u00adassets in bankruptcy. Today, it is owned by Nuance Communications Inc. of Burlington, which sells a line of software products bearing the Dragon name.\n\nIt took Dragon Systems years to get its groundbreaking technology to market. It\u2019s taking almost as long to sort out responsibility for the company\u2019s disastrous end.",

        "text": "Zsuzsi Roboz, who has died aged 82, was an artist with a gift for portraiture. Though she never regarded herself as being primarily a portrait painter, posterity will undoubtedly be grateful to her for her interest in portraying leading creative personalities of her time. These included figures from the worlds of dance, theatre, literature and music \u2013 she made a striking likeness of the conductor Sir Georg Solti, though she complained that he never took his nose out of a score that he was reading in preparation for an upcoming performance.\n\nHer 2011 series, Face to Face, was devoted to notable British and Irish writers, among them personalities as different from one another as Anita Brookner, Tom Stoppard, Seamus Heaney and PD James. She always tried to give these likenesses something that went further than simple realism. Essentially she was a symbolist artist \u2013 she wanted to catch the creative aura of those she portrayed, many of whom have not otherwise been the subjects of penetrating works of art of this sort.\n\nZsuzsi's beginnings were prosperous. She was born in Budapest, where her father, Imre Roboz, was the manager of the V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z theatre, which specialised in operetta in a city that particularly relished this form of entertainment. Her mother was a society hostess. Budapest was largely unscathed during the early years of the second world war, when Hungary had prudently, if reluctantly, taken the side of the Axis.\n\nFor most of the war years, the Roboz family lived a relatively unthreatened existence. But as the Russian army approached, Germany staged a coup and replaced the Hungarian government, and things then changed drastically. Budapest was besieged and Zsuzsi's father disappeared, killed, as her family later discovered, by the invading Russians.\n\nZsuzsi, her mother and a French lodger were sheltered by neighbours and eventually made a dramatic escape under gunfire across the melting ice of the Danube, and found their way to the safety of the allies.\n\nAfter a brief period in France, Zsuzsi was sent to secretarial school in London. There she soon made her way into the employ of the Hungarian film mogul Alexander Korda, who had been a friend of her father's at school. The real turning point in her life, however, came when she met the Italian painter Pietro Annigoni at one of his exhibitions in London. He was attracted by her charmingly gamine appearance, and she, no doubt, by the force of his personality. In 1954 she moved to Italy and spent a year in his studio class, returning to London equipped with skills as a draughtswoman.\n\nOne of her first commissions was to make drawings of what went on behind the scenes at the Windmill theatre, then in its last days of presenting nude revues. Throughout her career she was interested in portraying musicians and dancers, often in moments when they were at their most relaxed, and least conscious of the presence of a spectator.\n\nShe was part of a lively London bohemian scene. She made a brief marriage, in 1953, to an illustrator, Ley Kenyon, who made the mistake of thinking that she would be entirely obedient to his wishes. He discovered his mistake, as she later gleefully recalled, one night when he came home late from the pub. He went to the bathroom, and Zsuzsi, who had already packed her bags, locked him in and departed. They divorced, but in later years remained on reasonably friendly terms. Kenyon later became Jacques Cousteau's assistant.\n\nHer second marriage, in 1964, to the property developer Teddy Smith was a different matter. He admired what she did and was eager to encourage her talent. The fact that he was a patron of the recently founded Chichester Festival theatre gave her access to luminaries of the British stage. In 1972 she was commissioned to make a series of portraits celebrating 10 years of the enterprise. Her portrait drawing of Leslie Evershed-Martin, who founded the theatre, is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, as is her likeness of Dame Ninette de Valois, evidence of her continuing interest in the world of dance and dancers.\n\nAfter Smith's death, Zsuzsi lived quietly in Mayfair. She also had a small studio in Pimlico. Her chief way of entertaining was through a half-share in a grand-tier box at the Royal Albert Hall, which she used chiefly for the Proms. She particularly loved the late Romantic composers, such as Mahler. She also loved Bart\u00f3k, who was part of a Hungarian identity that Zsuzsi never completely abandoned. Her British friends used to joke that it was fatal to go with her to any gathering where there were Hungarian-speakers, as she immediately lapsed into that difficult but fascinating language, and left her companion stranded.\n\nShe is survived by Anthony, a stepson from her second marriage.\n\n\u2022 Zsuzsi (Suzanne) Roboz, artist, born 15 August 1929; died 9 July 2012",

        "text": "photos by Josh Reynolds for The Boston Globe\n\nChris Carrabba (left) of Dashboard Confessional and Third Eye Blind lead singer Stephan Jenkins at Blue Hills Bank Pavilion Thursday.\n\nNear the end of his band Dashboard Confessional\u2019s set at the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion on Thursday, singer-guitarist Chris Carrabba explained why his recently reborn anthemic-emo act decided to tour with Third Eye Blind. \u201cWhat do our fans have in common?\u201d he asked. \u201cAll our fans can sing.\u201d (He used a glowing yet unpublishable descriptor to drive the point home.)\n\nThursday\u2019s audience more than proved up to the challenge during the dual-headliner show. But the two bands share much more than chorale-ready devotees. Their hooky pop-rock crunch inspires lighter-raising and high fives; they showcase rapid-fire, brutally frank lyrics that detail the inner workings of the male mind; and most crucially, they share charismatic lead singers, men who know how to work a room even when they\u2019re baring their most brutal emotions.\n\nDashboard Confessional began as a stripped-down side project for Carrabba, who had fronted louder yet still feelings-forward acts like Further Seems Forever. It eventually came to the forefront for him, though, and as the band\u2019s popularity grew with songs like the gasping \u201cScreaming Infidelities\u201d and the intricate \u201cVindicated\u201d (which appeared on the \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d soundtrack), so did its sound, until it broke up in 2010.\n\nThe band\u2019s reunion earlier this year doubled as an opportunity for it to revisit its vast back catalog; Carrabba\u2019s potent voice served as a beacon, while his bandmates turned diaristic bedroom pop into roof-raising anthems. Carrabba was grateful and winking by turns, thanking the audience for sticking by him over the years and tossing off the occasional joke.\n\nThe San Francisco act Third Eye Blind is probably best known for \u201cSemi-Charmed Life,\u201d one of the \u201990s most potent tracks \u2014 thanks to its indelible hook (\u201cdoo doo do, doo da-doo doo\u201d), the existentially hedonistic track will rightfully be enshrined in that decade\u2019s pop time capsule alongside Smash Mouth\u2019s \u201cAll Star\u201d and the Rembrandts\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll Be There for You.\u201d\n\nBut the band\u2019s appeal reaches wider, as evidenced by Thursday night\u2019s throng. Lead singer Stephan Jenkins has a two-by-four voice, a preacher\u2019s charisma, and a startling willingness to lyrically reveal his worst traits; his band\u2019s omnivorous take on pop-rock helps the sourness go down a bit easier. The high-energy set, which included hits like the bubblegummy \u201cNever Let You Go\u201d alongside tracks from a just-released fifth album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d was supposed to end with \u201cLife.\u201d But Jenkins noticed a sign near the front asking for the straightforward album track \u201cGod of Wine,\u201d and he complied. The audience did, too.",

        "text": "History has been overly kind to \u201cFull House.\u201d Though it\u2019s now seen \u2014 through the obfuscating fog of nostalgia \u2014 as a classic family sitcom, the show was also archetypally average, hiding behind a ubiquitous laugh track and obnoxiously on-the-nose life lessons. It may well have been a television touchstone, but it was also the equivalent of a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup: fluffy, insubstantial, and so sickly sweet it could induce toothaches.\n\nSo when it was announced that Netflix planned to brush away the cobwebs for a new series dubbed \u201cFuller House,\u201d one question immediately arose: Why? Why this sitcom? Why does the original, which ran from 1987 to 1995, warrant a second serving, especially in a TV landscape already populated by series like \u201cModern Family,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d all of which mark smarter, more inclusive evolutions of the \u201cFull House\u201d formula?\n\nWell, as it turns out, the answer\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t, at all. In the six episodes sent to critics, \u201cFuller House\u201d suggests a raison d\u2019\u00eatre that amounts to little more than fan service of the most bare-faced, blaring variety.\n\nAs the pilot, by far the worst installment, teases out one familiar face after another (minus the Olsen twins, who get a fourth-wall-breaking admonishment for sitting this one out), an excess of communal back-patting takes center stage. \u201cDamn, we all still look good,\u201d Uncle Jesse (John Stamos, who admittedly does still look very good) even says at one point.\n\nBut like most of the shout-outs in \u201cFuller House,\u201d that line feels like less of a triumphant, meta declaration and more of a plea for fan validation. Jesse shouldn\u2019t sound so desperate. The live studio audience, of course, is ready with a hero\u2019s welcome, not just for Stamos but also Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, and Scott Weinger.\n\nHowever, the joy that hardcore fans will find in seeing this crew reassembled mostly intact is short-lived. At premiere\u2019s end, most of them hit the road, destined to flit back for occasional cameos, and the gender-flipped conceit of this new take becomes apparent: a widowed D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Cameron Bure) winds up installed in the San Francisco house, alongside sister Stephanie (Sweetin) and pal Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber), both of whom agree to help her raise a trio of young boys.\n\nThere will be three schools of thought around how \u201cFuller House\u201d riffs on the original\u2019s premise. Some may praise the absence of a domineering patriarch, seeing the freshly forged Tanner-Fuller-Gibbler triumvirate as a commendably feminist foundation. Others will likely fault the series for how it regressively encourages its three female leads to answer the call of motherhood and ditch any professional or personal ventures that could get in the way. And others still (the ones Netflix is really catering to) won\u2019t care to consider either thematic implication, instead relishing every stock plot, speech, and group hug the show has to offer, just as one relishes comfort food on a lazy Sunday morning.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub \u2014 with \u201cFuller House,\u201d Netflix has created its first critic-proof series. It\u2019s easy to wish everyone involved with this revival had been concerned with something more honorable than narcissistic self-celebration. Furthermore, in 2016, it\u2019s fair enough to look upon trite laughs, cloyingly sentimental touches, and cutesy diversions (a baby here, a puppy there) with some degree of distaste. If \u201cFull House\u201d had aired this year, it \u2014 like its sequel \u2014 would pale in comparison to practically everything else on offer. As such, most sitcom aficionados will find they\u2019ve outgrown the Tanner clan.\n\nNetflix knows it only has to please the ones who haven\u2019t, for whom seeing this mix of new and old characters run through the motions will feel like going back to the glory days of the sitcom itself. Bashing those folks is futile \u2014 let them enjoy this hollow exercise in nostalgia. But for the rest of us, \u201cFuller House\u201d never justifies its own existence, let alone why the uninitiated should give it a chance.",

        "text": "In recent weeks, \u201cGirls\u201d has put two central characters in a difficult spot \u2014 the classic \u201cill-fated love\u201d spot. Jessa and Adam, the show\u2019s two towering infernos, are enormously attracted to each other. But Jessa really doesn\u2019t want to hurt the prickly Hannah, her best friend and Adam\u2019s ex. Adam keeps aggressively courting Jessa, but she keeps fighting his efforts, trying to alter her lifelong pattern of unscrupulous, impulsive choices.\n\nActually, \u201cGirls\u201d is putting viewers in a difficult spot. too. It\u2019s obvious that Jessa and Adam, both looming physical presences, could make a great couple. They seem to belong together, in that somewhat indescribable but natural way, unlike Hannah and Adam, who never appreciated each other and were forever parsing misunderstandings. We\u2019ve watched the Jessa-Adam chemistry grow, as they\u2019ve toyed with friendship born of mutual sobriety. We\u2019ve seen that even the actors who play Adam and Jessa, Adam Driver and Jemima Kirke, click organically. But we know about the Ex Code \u2014 that you don\u2019t date your friends\u2019 past loves \u2014 and Hannah and her inevitably dramatic feelings of betrayal hang over all of us.\n\nOn many shows, this kind of three-way crash is something of a time killer. The lead guy and gal are clearly going to get there, with their wedding serving as one of the season finales, or even as the series finale. They are the show\u2019s fated pair, and that is the subtext of everything they do. But the writers need to find obstacles in the meantime, to fuel seasons of episodes. So they bring in a third player. On \u201cFriends,\u201d we knew all along that Ross and Rachel would wind up together, that they were \u201cmeant to be.\u201d But nonetheless we had to go through a ridiculous dating period between Joey and Rachel, as if. \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d played the same game, steering Robin into Barney\u2019s arms \u2014 even marrying them \u2014 while all along we felt in our heart of hearts that she\u2019d wind up with Ted, which she did.\n\nSometimes, though, writers fool with the fated-couple expectation, that often wearying clich\u00e9, and it can work perfectly. The best example I can think of was on \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d At the start of the series, viewers could easily assume that sensitive boy Dawson would end up with his childhood pal Joey. But as the series developed, it became clear that the endearing innocence of their early bond made them soulmates, but not lovers, and that Joey and Pacey were far more suited for each other romantically. In the end, Joey and Pacey were together, and it felt right.\n\nI certainly thought early in \u201cGirls\u201d that Hannah and Adam were destined to work out, that they\u2019d grow up and together, that he\u2019d be her Mr. Right and her Mr. Big. But the writers have shown the unbearable dysfunction of their relationship in such detail, it seems increasingly possible that Hannah and Adam aren\u2019t going to prevail. Is the Jessa and Adam story a detour, or is it a main thoroughfare to the end of the road, which will be next season? I love the thought that \u201cGirls\u201d would avoid the guaranteed-love formula, that it would follow through with its generally more realistic and honest approach to twentysomething romance in the 2010s.\n\nBy now you can probably tell that I am an Adam and Jessa shipper, that if I wrote fan fiction I would have them together and doing performance art on the streets forevermore. They could be Brooklyn\u2019s bushy, boho birds of a feather, mumblecore\u2019s own Gomez and Morticia Addams. It\u2019s so obvious they are cut from the same cloth; they\u2019re both moody, cryptic, and willfully unpredictable. Perhaps that means that, as Jessa said, a love affair would be a mess: \u201cYou know as well as I do, even if we could be together, even if Hannah didn\u2019t exist, that I would destroy you,\u201d she told him after they spent a carefree day together. \u201cAnd you would destroy me.\u201d I\u2019d definitely like to find out if that\u2019s true.",

I\u2019ve supported Jeremy Corbyn all the way along, from the moment he was elected. It was the right thing to do.,\u201d Miliband told the BBC. \u201cI think a lot of what he stands for is very important for us going forward. But I\u2019ve reluctantly reached a conclusion that his position is untenable.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is seeking urgent talks with Corbyn in an attempt to broker a compromise that would prevent the party plunging into a snap leadership contest, as Angela Eagle prepares to launch a challenge by the end of the day.\n\nSources close to Watson \u2013 who as Corbyn\u2019s deputy would become caretaker leader if he chooses to resign \u2013 said: \u201cEveryone needs to calm down and try and prevent a civil war in the Labour party.

My dream job but the situation is untenable.\u201d\n\nRelated: What are the rules for a Labour leadership race?\n\nEmma Lewell-Buck has stepped down as a shadow communities and local government minister, and 77 Labour councillors have signed a letter saying Corbyn should go.\n\nAll of Labour\u2019s 20 MEPs published a statement withdrawing their support from the leader.

She and Watson are both regarded as contenders, but others including the shadow work and pensions secretary, Owen Smith, could also run if a contest is triggered.\n\nOne Labour MP backing Eagle said there was \u201ca lot of satellite traffic\u201d between her camp and Watson\u2019s \u2013 and said they were likely to regard any attempt to persuade Corbyn to step aside as manoeuvring by the deputy leader.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s allies have made clear that he has no intention of stepping aside, and members of his team are readying themselves for a contest.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has told MPs seeking to overthrow Corbyn that they must accept his leadership if he sees off the challenge.

Crucially, he also appears to enjoy the support of trade union chiefs.\n\nMcDonnell, Corbyn\u2019s closest ally, told reporters as he left his home on Wednesday morning that he accepted there would be a leadership challenge, but urged Labour MPs to calm down.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt looks as though we will have a leadership election now \u2026 All we are saying to Labour MPs is play by the rules, play by the rules of our party, and if there is to be a democratic election, respect the wishes of our members.\u201d\n\nRelated: This is not Labour MPs vs Corbyn.

Beckett has already described herself as a \u201cmoron\u201d for having nominated Corbyn in the last Labour leadership contest.\n\n\u201cPart of what came out of the turbulence of the last day or so is a realisation there are people around Jeremy who are prepared to see the Labour party split rather than for him to go, and that is anathema to everybody who thinks that we need to get rid of this government and the damage that they are doing and the further damage that a rightwing \u2013 even more rightwing \u2013 Tory government would do,\u201d she said.\n\nIn further pressure from the Labour hierarchy, Tessa Jowell issued a direct plea on TV to Corbyn to stand down. The former culture secretary told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that the Labour leader was putting the party\u2019s future in jeopardy. She described the leadership crisis as a \u201ccomplete shambles\u201d and said it was a \u201cstatement of the obvious\u201d that Corbyn had to go.\n\nSpeaking directly to the camera on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, she said: \u201cJeremy, you love the Labour party like I do and the Labour party has given you every opportunity that you have been able to exercise to make life for your constituents better. You and I are in the same position in relation to that but it is absolutely clear that your continued leadership is putting the Labour party\u2019s future in jeopardy \u2026 so I ask you to follow the strongest possible view of the parliamentary party and stand down.\u201d\n\nMore than 230,000 people have signed an online 38 Degrees petition expressing confidence in Corbyn.\n\nOver 230,000 sign a vote of confidence in Jeremy Corbyn compared to 172 Labour MPs who oppose him.https://t.co/B8VLsrqsCI\n\nLisa Nandy, who stepped down as shadow energy secretary on Tuesday, said bullying, intimidation, harassment and death threats had been \u201cunleashed against MPs from the right to the left of the party\u201d.\n\nWriting for the Guardian, she warned against her party being \u201csmashed apart by a polarised, toxic, angry battle that is silencing the sensible majority\u201d.",

Designed to mimic the act of barefoot running, the minimalist running shoe has a shaped sole and a mesh top, with individual sleeves for each toe.\n\nIn its advertising, Vibram says the shoe improves posture and strengthens leg muscles. But the lawsuit says that using FiveFingers may be risky for runners.\n\n\u201cIndeed, running in FiveFingers may increase injury risk as compared to running in conventional running shoes, and even when compared to running barefoot,\u2019\u2019 according to a copy of the suit, filed in US District Court in Boston.\n\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox:\n\nThe Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Vibram suit follows several recent cases against Massachusetts shoe companies about how they market sneakers.\n\nLast year, Canton-based Reebok International Ltd. refunded $25 million to customers after the Federal Trade Commission found it made deceptive claims that its toning shoes improved muscle tone. A suit filed in January 2011 alleged that New Balance, of Boston, also overstated the benefits of its toning shoes.\n\nFiveFingers shoes have gained in popularity. Still, according to SportsOne Source, which tracks the sporting goods industry, barefoot-style footwear represents only 8 percent of the $6.5 billion running shoe market in the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally different manner of running,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Powell, an analyst with SportsOne Source, \u201cand you need to be pretty dedicated to it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThere are similarities between the Vibram lawsuit and the Reebok case, but the Vibram claims differ, he said.\n\nWhile Reebok promised firmer butts and toned legs as a result of wearing its toning shoes, he said the Vibram claims are more about the benefits of barefoot running, which Vibram claims are supported by scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cAnd there is ample evidence that training without shoes allows you to run faster and farther with fewer injuries,\u2019\u2019 the company says on its website.\n\nVibram, with corporate headquarters in Italy, is a 70-year-old company known for pioneering the use of rubber soles for footwear.

        "text": "THE riposte to doubts about Abenomics, the three-part plan of Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, to shake the country from its economic torpor, is more of the same, and a lot more. On October 31st the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stunned the financial markets by unexpectedly expanding its programme of quantitative easing. The bank\u2019s existing measures, a \u201cdifferent dimension\u201d of easing from past efforts, were already daringly bold. Now it will swell Japan\u2019s monetary base at an even faster pace, by around \u00a580 trillion ($712 billion) each year, up from \u00a560 trillion-70 trillion currently. To do so, it will hoover up still larger quantities of Japanese government bonds (JGBs). This additional step, said Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the BoJ, \u201cshows our unwavering determination to end deflation\u201d.\n\nThe bank\u2019s action is also an admission of partial failure thus far. Its bond-buying has succeeded in sparking some inflation, yet its goal of achieving price rises of 2% a year by around April 2015 remains a distant possibility. Along with the government, it badly underestimated the dampening effect of a hike in the consumption tax in April this year, which caused the economy to shrink by 1.7% in the second quarter. Because of faltering consumer and corporate demand, and falling oil prices, inflation is now heading in the wrong direction, and may dip beneath 1%.\n\nIn recent weeks, economists had started to question Mr Kuroda\u2019s oft-stated commitment to banishing Japan\u2019s entrenched deflationary psychology. They suggested that the bank\u2019s formerly conservative mindset might even be returning. Mr Kuroda\u2019s predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, pursued monetary easing only half-heartedly, and achieved little. Meanwhile, Mr Kuroda had sought to stealthily extend the deadline for exiting deflation. That did little to reassure that Abenomics was on track in spite of stalled growth and sluggish inflation. Upon announcing the additional easing, Mr Kuroda admitted that matters had reached a \u201ccritical point\u201d, as the bank\u2019s efforts were losing momentum.\n\nNow a fresh round of no-holds-barred QE will immediately boost Mr Abe\u2019s economic plan. The Nikkei stock index\u2014a vital gauge of success for the government\u2014rose to its highest level in seven years on the news. The yen lurched further downwards, which will help import inflation. In addition to the tidings from the central bank, there was still more sugar on offer for equity markets. The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest, said it would slash its holdings of government bonds from 60% to 35% in order to buy more shares. The strength of the co-ordination between the government, the BoJ and the ministry of labour, health and welfare, which oversees the GPIF, surprised observers. After the GPIF\u2019s changes, most economists had not expected further monetary easing until 2015.\n\nThe BoJ\u2019s action this week also took markets aback because in recent public appearances Mr Kuroda had stuck to a bullish economic outlook. Yet on October 31st the BoJ halved its forecast for economic growth for the 2014 fiscal year to 0.5%. The bank also made its timeframe for achieving 2% inflation open-ended, removing its two-year deadline. Nonetheless, following the additional easing, the central bank still expects to meet its inflation target in 2015. As well as buying an additional \u00a530 trillion of JGBs a year, the BoJ will also purchase more risky assets in the form of exchange-traded funds and investment trusts in Japanese property.\n\nA motivation for Mr Kuroda\u2014in addition to visibly slowing inflation and weak growth\u2014may have been an intensifying political debate over whether or not Mr Abe should again raise the unpopular consumption tax from 8% to 10% in 2015. The BoJ is strongly in favour of a second hike in order to repair Japan\u2019s stretched public finances. More monetary easing should encourage Mr Abe to press ahead.\n\nBut this latest round of QE is not without its detractors. In April 2013 the BoJ\u2019s nine-strong policy board voted unanimously in favour of its radical new monetary drive, this time it revealed a rare split. Four members voted against the expansion of monetary easing, which came just two days after America\u2019s Federal Reserve ended its third round of QE. It is unclear whether or not the dissenters disagreed with the extra stimulus itself, or merely with its timing. This week\u2019s further easing will intensify the worries around the policy announced last spring. Chief among these is that QE will be hard to exit without alarming the bond market. Yet for the time being, Mr Kuroda is waging a more dogged fight against deflation. The prospect of Japanese \u201ctapering\u201d is ever more distant.",

Bradley, the magazine's owner, on Tuesday and accepted it and resigned from The Times today. He said he expected to start at his new job in about two weeks.\n\nMr. Bennet's appointment was announced to the staff late this afternoon.\n\nA graduate of Yale, Mr. Bennet held an editing post at The Washington Monthly from 1989 to 1991 but otherwise has devoted his career to writing. He briefly resigned from The Times in 2003 for a job at The New Yorker but before starting decided he was not ready to leave the newspaper and continued at his post in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Atlantic has been searching for an editor since last April, when Mr. Bradley announced that he was moving it from its 149-year-old home in Boston to Washington. The magazine has been in some turmoil since, with many staff members in Boston deciding to stay there, and with Mr. Bradley hiring several writers on his own and rebuilding the operation in Washington, all without an editor at the top. In a sign of the flux, the current issue carries no masthead at all.\n\nMr. Bennet is the magazine's first official editor since Mr. Kelly stepped down in September 2002 to return to writing. Before Mr. Bradley had named a replacement, Mr. Kelly was killed in Iraq on assignment for the magazine. Cullen Murphy, the managing editor, oversaw The Atlantic without the title of editor; once the magazine's move to Washington was announced, he tapered off his duties. Scott Stossel became managing editor and handled the move, which is now virtually complete.\n\nMr. Bennet said he accepted the offer because \"it's a chance to help, encourage and preserve the practice of serious, long-form journalism and a chance to work with great writers and editors.\" He said that because of the \"uncertain time\" for print journalism, \"this kind of undertaking is more important than it's been.\"\n\nMr. Bradley said he selected Mr. Bennet, whom he first met through a mutual friend eight years ago, after a lengthy listening tour in which he talked to 80 leading journalists about his search for \"extreme talent\" and the mission for The Atlantic.\n\nHe said Mr. Bennet had \"lived life near the headlines,\" had excelled at long-form narratives, and had a \"selfless nature.\"\n\nBill Keller, executive editor of The Times, said he hated losing Mr. Bennet and called him \"an extraordinary talent \u0097 voraciously curious, an original thinker and a dazzling writer.\"\n\n\"He'll have to slow his heartbeat to the pace of a monthly, which may be frustrating for a guy so deeply engaged in the news, but it's a brilliant choice,\" Mr. Keller said. \"His name on the masthead will be enough to make me grab for the magazine.\"\n\nMr. Bennet was to become the paper's Beijing correspondent later this year and has been in language training since November.",

You've seen the camouflage development mules. You've seen the interior. You've learned about its hybrid drivetrain and how much power its packing.\n\nToday, you will learn that the McLaren P1 supercar will accelerate from 0-62mph in \"less than three seconds\" and on to a limited top speed of 218mph. Fast, no?\n\nThat's not all. McLaren has revealed more acceleration details with which you can arm yourself in the inevitable Discussing Which Supercar Is Best In The Pub On Friday Night With Friends game (deluxe edition). The P1 will sprint from 0-124mph (0-200km/h) in less than seven seconds, and go from 0-186mph (0-300km/h) in 17 seconds. McLaren rightly informs us that last benchmark is some nine seconds quicker than the old McLaren F1.\n\nTo provide you with some perspective, the Porsche 918 Spyder is estimated to hit 62mph in under three seconds and 124mph in around eight seconds, while a Bugatti Veyron SS \u2013 the 1,183bhp orange merchant of speed \u2013 hits 124mph from rest in 7.3 seconds and 186mph in 15 seconds dead. So despite McLaren's claims that the P1 was never meant to be the fastest outright, it's clearly no slouch.\n\nProduction is limited to 375 models only, combining \u2013 as you know \u2013 a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 to an electric motor to provide 903bhp. And because it's a hybrid, emissions (combined) sit below 200g/km of CO2. There are also DRS and IPAS technologies on board to ally it closely with the company's Formula 1 activity. This is good.\n\nPirelli has been working with McLaren on the tires too, and has developed a special compound for the P1, probably something a little bit less rubbish than the F1 tire TopGear.com made in Turkey. Ahem.\n\nAnd here's one of the best bits about the P1. We're told the brakes are akin to those on a GT3 racer, developed by Akebono and featuring a new kind of carbon ceramic disc, previously used in space. Space!\n\nSadly, for us mere mortals, the price is equally cosmic. Because McLaren has confirmed that this limited run, 903bhp rear-wheel-drive hypercar that we estimate will weigh around 1,500kg (3,305lbs), will cost \u00a3866,000 ($1.3 million).\n\nThat's quite a chunk of change, but then the upcoming Porsche 918 Spyder and new Ferrari Enzo aren't going to be cheap.\n\nThis story originally appeared on TopGear.com.",

        "text": "So if they can help reduce injury, shouldn\u2019t they be mandatory, just like motorbike helmets? Australia tried it in the early 90s and the result was a 15 to 20 per cent drop in the number of hospital admissions for head injuries. That would have been great, but it also reduced the number of cyclists by around 35 per cent. The hassle and, for teenagers, embarrassment of wearing one steered people away from bikes and towards public transport and cars. And that, counter-intuitively, could have been bad news for their health.\n\nA recent study in the British Medical Journal showed that cycling has a positive health impact around 77 times larger than the potential for serious injury; essentially, there\u2019s a small chance that you\u2019ll come a cropper, but a very large chance that you\u2019ll reduce your likelihood of suffering mental illness, heart disease and obesity. That means the laws were hugely counterproductive; they reduced cycling injuries, but only by reducing the number of cyclists, and those people then became more likely to come to some other kind of less-dramatic and tangible harm. Clearly, if this was an acceptable approach then we could easily slash injuries by 100 per cent simply by banning bicycles.\n\nThe CTC, the UK\u2019s largest cycling charity, has long argued against mandatory helmet laws for a similar reason. It claims they would make cycling seem more dangerous than it actually is, putting people off. \u201cThe evidence on this question is complex and contradictory, providing as much support for those who are deeply sceptical of helmets as for those who swear by them,\u201d it says.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of enforcing new laws. In the first year after the Australian State of Victoria made helmets mandatory there were 19,229 Bicycle Offence Penalty Notices issued. Do we want to tie up that much police time on a crime which has no negative impact on a third party? South Africa made helmets mandatory, then couldn\u2019t agree on exactly how to enforce it, so never did.\n\nThere's even evidence that wearing a helmet can put you at more risk. A 2006 study by Jeff Brewster from the University of Bath found that drivers passed closer to cyclists wearing a helmet when overtaking than they did those without them. The driver's subconscious sees them as less vulnerable and therefore less worthy of a wide berth.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that mandatory safety devices such as motorbike helmets and seatbelts in cars have been lifesavers on a huge scale. But neither had the same potential for harmful side-effects: dissuade motorcyclists from riding and they\u2019ll buy a car, which is actually far safer (if less fun). Meanwhile, there is virtually nothing that will discourage drivers.\n\nPersonally, I believe that wearing a helmet has more pros than cons, even though cycling is not as risky as many would have you believe. But there are those out there who would rather not ride than be made to wear a helmet, and for that reason the idea is a non-starter.",

Now, thanks to the unlikely sex champion Bill Gates, graphene could be used to make the thinnest, lightest, most impenetrable condom ever conceived.\n\n\u201cThe common analogy is that wearing a condom is like taking a shower with a raincoat on,\u201d says Dr Papa Salif Sow, senior program officer on the HIV team at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has awarded $100,000 (\u00a360,000) to scientists at the University of Manchester's National Graphene Institute to aid their pursuit of the ultimate super-sheath. \u201cA redesigned condom that overcomes inconvenience, fumbling or perceived loss of pleasure would be a powerful weapon in the fight against poverty.\u201d\n\nAt only one atom thick, an all-graphene condom would put the Durex Ultra Thin to shame \u2013 although the fact that the material is barely visible to the naked eye could lead to some awkward moments between the sheets. A slight ruffle of the duvet and could it just float away?\n\nDr Aravind Vijayaraghavan, who will lead the research team, explains the focus is on developing a composite material, with latex, \u201ctailored to enhance the natural sensation during intercourse while using a condom, which should encourage and promote condom use.\u201d\n\nIt will be achieved, he says, \u201cby combining the strength of graphene with the elasticity of latex to produce a new material which can be thinner, stronger, more stretchy, safer and, perhaps most importantly, more pleasurable.\u201d\n\nBut Vijayaraghavan and his colleagues are not alone in their pursuit. The Gates Foundation has declared it will give out a total of $1m in grants to secure a next-generation condom that \u201csignificantly preserves or enhances pleasure\u201d \u2013 and there is no shortage of competitors.\n\nResearchers at the University of Oregon are using their grant to develop an ultra-thin polyurethane polymer condom with \u201cshape memory\u201d properties, that would vacuum-seal around the penis as it heated up during intercourse. The body heat generated during sex would make the condom\u2019s molecules retract, creating a snug fit twice as thin as the normal latex variety. If shrink-wrapping your manpiece isn't enough, it comes embedded with antimicrobial nanoparticles, to guard against sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nIf this all sounds too techy, then perhaps Mark McGlothlin, of Apex Medical Technologies in San Diego, has the answer. \u201cA lot of people are trying to get stronger and thinner material \u2013 that was always my focus,\u201d he told the New Republic. But why innovate, when the material already exists \u2013 in the form of collagen fibrils from cow tendons. After all, didn't people manage for centuries with sheep intestines? \u201cThe texture of collagen is very much like the mucous membrane,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feel of it, the heat transfer of it, and to the touch, it feels very much like skin.\u201d\n\nMcGlothlin plans to source his beef tendon from a Chinese food store in California, but he says that slaughterhouses, or even fish markets, are other potential sources. Next time you're at the butchers, you might think twice before turning your nose up at that bag of offal.",

        "text": "Walpole Old Chapel, Suffolk. Christopher Stell wrote despairingly to its trustees when they were planning to sell it. Photograph: Historic Chapels Trust\n\nChristopher Stell, who has died aged 84 from kidney failure, was recently described as the \"doyen of nonconformist architectural historians\". His reputation in this field was established by his weighty four-volume Inventory of Nonconformist Chapels and Meeting Houses in England that appeared between 1986 and 2002.\n\nThe architecture of religious dissent in England is sometimes modest and deliberately self-effacing, especially those places of worship built by the Quakers and the earlier Congregational and Unitarian groups. But from the 19th century nonconformity often produced well-appointed buildings, proud to assert differences from established religion in their architecture. All seek to bear testimony to centuries of religious diversity in England since nonconformist worship was first made conditionally lawful in 1689. Yet architectural (and other) historians have been slow to catch up and, until Stell's inventory, too often ignored the majority of places of worship in Britain \u2013 that is, those that are not Anglican.\n\nIn particular, Stell's work highlighted the many serious omissions in the Pevsner Architectural Guides of that time, with the inventory itself becoming a \"Pevsner for nonconformism\". Like his predecessor, Stell visited each site by car. Unlike Nikolaus Pevsner, he drove himself and also recorded the buildings with photographs, careful scale drawings and sometimes sketches. It was a marathon task and his family became used to his absence throughout the week.\n\nIt is a testimony to his work that the revised Buildings of England volumes of today do list and discuss nonconformist places of worship with far greater seriousness.\n\nStell was born and brought up in Liverpool, the son of a PE teacher, and read architecture at Liverpool University's School of Architecture. Completing his training, he resolved to be a building historian and early writing quickly established his credentials as an accomplished self-taught researcher.\n\nSo many chapels and meeting houses have been demolished since the second world war, especially in those working-class communities where the once thriving \"co-op and chapel culture\" has collapsed in recent decades. Their entry in his inventory has become their obituary. Many have been converted to other uses which at least preserves the chapel outlines in the English landscape; but the photos in the inventory poignantly show the lost interiors.\n\nIn 1988 Stell helped found the Chapels Society which has pioneered serious study of this neglected area. When he heard that Walpole Old Chapel in Suffolk was to be sold off he wrote to its trustees: \"It truly amazes me that any denomination should wish to dispose itself of one of the finest and oldest and most richly evocative buildings in its care. To dispose of a worn-out building is one thing. To disclaim any further interest in the one tangible link with early Suffolk Independency is another.\"\n\nIn fact the church did divest itself of this simple but moving building though happily it went to the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, of which Stell was also a founding spirit and trustee for two decades.\n\nStell was trustee of the Ancient Monuments Society for 30 years and attended every one of the annual Vernacular Architecture Group meeting for 50 years. He personally rescued a partly 17th-century stone house in Calderdale intended for demolition, which he bought for \u00a350. He got it listed and adapted it with the absolute minimum of modernisation, long before such a domestic style became fashionable.\n\nAlways modest but meticulous in his scholarship, he quietly appreciated the recognition of an OBE in 1989 and the fact that his work was the first port of call for younger scholars. A lifelong Baptist, he enjoyed the Athenaeum \u2013 traditionally better known for the Anglican bishops among its members \u2013 for Stell was a champion of religious dissent who felt confident in the corridors of power.\n\nMany will remember his astonishing recall for buildings he had last seen 20 or 30 years previously, his endless curiosity and his dapper hats. Sometimes he wore a brown bowler, sometimes a deerstalker \u2013 for he loved Conan Doyle stories, as only a meticulous detective of buildings would.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jean, whom he married in 1957, and their sons, John and Edward.\n\n\u2022 Christopher Stell, architectural historian, born 26 January 1929; died 16 January 2014",

        "text": "We swim in an ocean of feedback. It\u2019s not just those performance reviews at work. It\u2019s your reflection in the mirror, the comment your spouse made at breakfast, or the accusatory note you just found in your mailbox from your neighbor.\n\nRecent research that suggests that how you react to that feedback \u2014 whether you take it in stride or get flattened by it \u2014 is due at least in part to your wiring. When it comes to sensitivity to feedback, individuals can vary up to three thousand percent in terms of how far they swing, emotionally, and how long it takes them to recover. And that has profound implications for their ability to hear the feedback they get, and to learn anything from it.\n\nTake Alita. She has been highly sensitive to criticism since she was a child. Now an accomplished obstetrician, her skills and confidence have matured, yet her sensitivity to feedback is just as strong as it was when she was young. \u201cThree years ago we did patient satisfaction surveys,\u201d Alita explains. \u201cMy patients love the attention I give them, and my reviews were largely positive. Yet there were a few comments from patients frustrated that I sometimes run late.\u201d She adds, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt the same way about my practice since.\u201d\n\nWhile Alita knows intellectually that these are a few negative comments among many, and that, in fact, it\u2019s the attention that she gives each patient that causes her to run late, this doesn\u2019t change her emotional reaction to the feedback itself.\n\nSound familiar? If you\u2019re like Alita, you\u2019ve probably been hearing the same advice for much of your life: \u201cDon\u2019t be so sensitive,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d \u201cYou need to get a thicker skin.\u201d Yet new research suggests that this is far harder for some than others.\n\nThree factors can be used to measure our sensitivity to feedback. The first is Baseline, which measures your general state of happiness or contentment. In the wake of positive or negative events (or feedback), we all tend to gravitate back toward our baseline. Some people have a relatively high baseline \u2013 like Elaine in the next cubicle who always seems so (gratingly) cheerful no matter how much pressure the team is under. Others \u2014 like Mortimer down in purchasing \u2014 may have a relatively low happiness baseline, perpetually dissatisfied with their lives (and with you), regardless of how well things may be going.\n\nThe second variable is Swing \u2014 how far up or down you go as a result of positive or negative feedback. Someone with small swing is \u201ceven keeled\u201d: Nothing excites them much, and few things really get them too upset. If you swing wider emotionally, your ups and downs will be more intense and you\u2019ll require less stimulation to move you off your baseline.\n\nAnd finally, Sustain or Recovery, which measures how long it takes you to return to your baseline. How long do you sustain a bounce in your step in the wake of an appreciative email from an important customer? How long does it take you to recover from the public dressing down you got from your boss on the newsroom floor? Recent findings from neuro-imaging show that positive and negative swing and recovery can operate independently. If you have small swing and short sustain on positive feedback, and wide swing and long recovery on the negatives, that\u2019s a tough combination. Positive feedback disappears quickly, while negative feedback hits you hard and keeps you down for a good long while.\n\nThis is Alita\u2019s profile, and it\u2019s why she finds critical feedback \u2013 even well-intended \u201csuggestions\u201d from patients about how to better manage her time \u2013 so upsetting. Rather than prompting her to improve service or better manage her appointments, it paralyzes and demotivates her. Her head delivery nurse, Toni, has the opposite profile; she\u2019s unflappable in the face of stressful events, and she can shrug off even angry attacks within minutes.\n\nThe good news for Alita is that wiring is only part of the equation. Researchers estimate that it accounts for about 40% of how we react, and whether it\u2019s a little more or a little less doesn\u2019t matter. The bigger point is that a significant part of how we react to negative feedback is not from wiring, but rather, results from the story we tell ourselves about what the feedback means.\n\nIn other words, our own upset can cause us to distort the feedback we receive. For example, say someone tells you that you were singing off-key \u2014 it\u2019s about your singing, of this song, this time. But through the lens of upset, the feedback is supersized: \u201cI must always sing off key and no one tells me. I can never do anything right. I\u2019m a loser and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\nAlita is doing a version of this when she dwells on the one or two complaints about keeping patients waiting and ignores all the comments from patients who adore her. Given her wiring, she is easily upset, but she\u2019s compounding the problem by telling a story that incapacitates her. Her reaction to the feedback is blocking her ability to learn from it.\n\nWe can all learn to manage feedback more skillfully by learning how to see the feedback at \u201cactual size.\u201d Feedback should be bound in time (feedback about right now is not about the future) and by specificity (feedback about one thing is not about everything) and by size (needing to improve by 10% is different from needing to improve by 80%).\n\nUnderstanding our own triggered reactions to feedback can help us all regain our footing, and turn even upsetting feedback into something we can work with, and use to grow.",
        "generated": "The article discusses the concept of \"feedback sensitivity,\" or the tendency to react strongly to both positive and negative feedback.The author explains that this sensitivity is not just a personal quirk, but rather a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.",

        "text": "Detail from Artemisia Gentileschi's Susanna and the Elders (1610). Click for full image\n\nRevealing the history of female artists on television may sound an easy project, a delightful exercise in heritage tourism. Haven't we moved beyond a worthy roundup of forgotten heroines, hidden from history? After all, feminist art history has been investigating the female gaze since Linda Nochlin asked \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" in 1971. Magisterial surveys and text books have come since, from Germaine Greer's The Obstacle Race (1979) to Griselda Pollock and Rozika Parker's Old Mistresses (1991), enabling art history degrees to offer courses on gender and \"ways of seeing\" for the last 20 years or so. Engaging TV on the subject of this debate would be easy, I blithely presumed, until I embarked on the simple but fundamental task of seeing female art for myself.\n\nIs art male? Most institutions would have us think so. The disparities are startling. In 1989 the feminist Guerrilla Girls discovered that fewer than 5% of the modern works in the Metropolitan Museum in New York were by women, but 85% of the nudes were female. It is usually possible to see works by one or two women in an entire museum, but you could spend hours looking. I was relieved to find Judith Leyster's tiny but spell-binding Proposition (1631) and Clara Peeters' genre-defining Still Life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels (1621) in the Hague's Gemeentemuseum.\n\nEven Artemisia Gentileschi's masterpiece Judith Beheading Holofernes (1620) has only been exhibited in the Uffizi since 2000. A Medici duchess had banished Gentileschi's assassination scene to a dark corridor, finding her \"blood work\" too grisly for display.\n\nWeeks of negotiation and an Italian fixer got me into the Vasari corridor to film. This kilometre walkway snakes from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace, crossing the Arno over the Ponte Vecchio. Built in 1564, it allowed the Medici to travel unmolested between their palace and government offices. It is lined with self-portraits by artists, a pantheon of art history from the 16th century onwards. But of the 1,700 self-portraits only 7% are by women.\n\nDid women not paint, sculpt or craft? Or were female efforts so third-rate they did not earn the wall space? The absence of a celebrated female pantheon contrasts starkly with women's success in literature. But the requirements of authorship were far easier to fulfil than the demands of art. Writing required only literacy, access to a library and a desk. Even the risky exposure of publication could be offset by anonymity. By contrast, art demanded complex training, public production and was enmeshed in a well-guarded infrastructure. Unyielding social prejudices, prohibitions on formal training and legal restrictions on female commerce hobbled the woman artist.\n\nI was prepared for a hunt, but nevertheless the near invisibility of women's art was shocking: I was forced into storage facilities and basements. The Advancing Women Artists Foundation estimates that 1,500 works by women are currently stored in Florence's various deposits, most of which have not been on public view for centuries. To the question \"Are all of these works of a high artistic standard?\" Jane Fortune, head of the foundation, answers: \"We'll never know unless they are seen.\"\n\nPublic galleries seem tacitly to endorse the conservative view, exemplified by Brian Sewell's assertion that \"only men are capable of aesthetic greatness\". But painters and sculptors were artisans working within family-based workshops, just like tailors, locksmiths, goldsmiths and cabinetmakers. Art was a trade. Few paintings were the product of a single hand \u2013 only the face and hands might be the work of the \"master\". The male artist's brand was a fiction. Marietta Tintoretto worked alongside her father in Venice, Barbara Longhi beside her brother in Ravenna, their labour a vital constituent of the family economy, but unrecognised outside the workshop.\n\nA deep belief in the impossibility of female genius is at work. Many of Leyster's sunny canvases celebrating the social life of the Dutch golden age were so skilful they were attributed to Frans Hals, despite her signature.\n\nThe Bolognese Elisabetta Sirani produced more than 200 pieces in a 13-year career, garnering international acclaim for her smooth religious art. She ran the family workshop that embraced her sisters, supported her father when he could no longer paint and established an art school for young girls. The very accomplishment, speed and fluency of her art, however, laid her open to the accusation that she could not have created it \u2013 a man must have helped her \u2013 an accusation she saw off by staging live demonstrations of her painting.\n\nGentileschi could match the men of counter-reformation art, but chose to dramatise the struggles of women. She depicted the same heroines, even repeating the scenes of her father Orazio, but she charged hers with a pungent critique of male possession of women. The violence of voyeurism is palpable in her Susanna and the Elders (1610), when the cowering woman is victim to the lecherous gaze of two old men. They will accuse her of the capital crime of adultery unless she agrees to sleep with them. Her strong twisting body is displayed, but her horror is uppermost, and her arms are raised in resistance. \"What are YOU looking at?\" the painting says to us. Compare this with Tintoretto's titillating version in which Susanna seems to know she is being watched and exhibits her white nakedness in an obliging soft performance. The episode becomes a pretext for erotica, and as the woman is complicit in her own subjugation, the dirt of sexual oppression is whitewashed away.

        "text": "The cellist Charlotte Moorman (1933-1991) was an intrepid performer who was central to avant-garde culture in New York during the 1960s and \u201970s\u2014the \u201cJeanne d\u2019Arc of New Music,\u201d the composer Edgard Var\u00e8se dubbed her\u2014even if many weren\u2019t sure how to evaluate her talents.\n\nWas she advancing the cause of free expression when she played on stage in the nude or wore a bra of televisions or was attached to a flight of balloons or let herself be covered in 20 pounds of chocolate fudge?\n\nOr did some of her antics become an excuse for men to ogle her and for the public to dismiss all unconventional art as a put-on? Was she, as well as being collaborator and muse for Nam June Paik in his revolutionary mixed-media pieces, also his stooge?\n\nThese questions were debated in New York\u2019s downtown artistic circles (especially by feminists) when she was alive. And they are quietly raised again in the celebratory exhibition and catalog \u201cA Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant-Garde, 1960s-1980s\u201d at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University, as well as in Joan Rothfuss \u2019s entertaining new biography, \u201cTopless Cellist: The Improbable Life of Charlotte Moorman.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Rothfuss\u2019s research, Moorman could have enjoyed a normal middle-class American life. Growing up in Little Rock, Ark., an only child who studied music and won the \u201cMiss City Beautiful\u201d contest at age 19, she was not a born rebel. Even after her move in 1957 to New York, where she attended the Juilliard School for a year and married a double-bassist, she envisioned herself playing cello in an orchestra or string ensemble.\n\nBut performing the classics, Moorman decided, was a bore compared to the offerings in New York\u2019s experimental music and art scene during the \u201960s. Her marriage annulled, she took up with a series of male mentors. (She ended up happily paired with the visual artist Frank Pileggi. )\n\nAn eccentric who never threw anything away, Moorman has left the show\u2019s six curators\u2014one of whom is Ms. Rothfuss\u2014with almost too much material to sift in presenting her flamboyant life. (Northwestern bought the artist\u2019s archive and has been organizing it since 2001.)\n\nIn addition to photographs of her in many productions, the exhibition has museum loans of Paik\u2019s video sculptures and a program of films and videos that shows her playing works by Paik (\u201cSonata for Adults Only\u201d) and others. There are cellos that Moorman fashioned, in neon or from syringes (used for her cancer treatments), as well as the felt-covered instrument that Joseph Beuys made for her to use in one of his works.\n\nAnnotated scores of music she performed by New York\u2019s avant-garde ( John Cage, Ornette Coleman, Paik) are here, along with her copy of Karlheinz Stockhausen \u2019s \u201cOriginale (Originals),\u201d a piece from 1964 in which she played the part of the \u201cString Player,\u201d wearing only gauze. Moorman was a key figure in helping these composers to introduce unpredictability, spectacle, danger and humor into the rarefied air of the classical music concert.\n\nOne way to liberate the audience, Paik believed, was to add nudity. In 1967 Moorman performed half-naked in his \u201cOpera Sextronique\u201d at a theater near Times Square. Arrested for indecent exposure, she spent the night in jail. The tabloid reporting on her trial, which resulted in a suspended sentence, defined her ever after in the public\u2019s mind as the \u201cTopless Cellist,\u201d a label she resented when she wasn\u2019t capitalizing on it.\n\nMoorman\u2019s packrat habits have proved invaluable in reconstructing a less well-documented phase of her career: her role as an impresario.\n\nIn 1963 she founded an annual Festival of the Avant Garde in New York. With almost no resources except her own vivaciousness, she produced it for 15 years, moving it around the city into nontraditional arenas for art and music\u2014Grand Central Terminal, Shea Stadium, Floyd Bennett Field, and the World Trade Center.\n\nThe walls and cases in the exhibition\u2019s second half are papered with her ads and programs for the festivals, supplemented by the photographs of Peter Moore, one of the few who attended all of these ephemeral events. Dozens of composers (Var\u00e8se, Cage, Morton Feldman, Luciano Berio ), filmmakers ( Bruce Conner, Jack Smith ), performance artists and dancers ( Allan Kaprow, Yoko Ono, Dick Higgins, Lucinda Childs ) participated because Moorman cajoled them.\n\nShe had \u201ca flair for getting EVERYBODY involved, including the more sophisticated who think Charlotte is silly; and she always somehow pulled it off,\u201d wrote the critic Jill Johnston in the Village Voice after one of these festivals.\n\nSome feminist artists in the \u201960s and \u201970s were wary of Moorman. Carolee Schneemann thought her a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d and the roster of her festivals was overwhelmingly male.\n\nThe public was more flummoxed. In a clip here from the Merv Griffin TV show, the studio audience laughs nervously as she holds a string down the back of Jerry Lewis and uses him to perform Paik\u2019s \u201cHuman Cello.\u201d\n\nA comedian in her own right, whose friendly smile and Southern accent could disarm most hostile crowds, Moorman knew that just because you weren\u2019t afraid to look ridiculous didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t serious.\n\nMr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.",

        "text": "Jun 3, 2016 7:26 AM EDT World\n\nPARIS -- The swollen Seine River kept rising Friday, spilling out across its banks and onto some streets in Paris as curators at the Louvre closed its doors to the public and scrambled to protect a huge trove of art from the museum's priceless collection from the flooding.\n\nThe Seine, which officials said was at its highest level in nearly 35 years, was expected to peak sometime later Friday.\n\nNearly a week of heavy rain has led to serious flooding across a swathe of Europe, where 14 people have died and more are missing. Although the rain has tapered off in some areas, floodwaters are still climbing up over scores of river banks. Traffic in the French capital was snarled as flooding choked roads, and several Paris railway stations were shut.\n\nWhile the Louvre's most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" was safe on an upper floor, officials said about 250,000 artworks were located in flood-risk areas, mostly in basement storerooms. The art was hastily being moved upstairs -- a move officials described as precautionary.\n\nThe Orsay museum, on the left bank of the Seine, was also closed Friday to prepare for possible flooding.\n\nA spokeswoman at the Louvre said museum had not taken such precautions in its modern history - since its 1993 renovation at the very least. She spoke on condition of anonymity in line with the museum's policy.\n\nAt the Louvre, disappointed tourists were being turned away.\n\n\"I am really sorry, but we're closed today,\" one staffer told visitors. \"We have to evacuate masterpieces from the basement.\"\n\nElsewhere in Europe, authorities were counting the cost of the floods as they waded through muddy streets and waterlogged homes.\n\nGerman authorities said the body of a 65-year-old man was found overnight in the town of Simbach am Inn, bringing the country's death toll to 10. France's Interior Ministry also reported the death of a 74-year-old man who fell from his horse and drowned in a river in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris, the second death in France.\n\nIn eastern Romania, two people died and 200 people were evacuated from their homes as floods swept the area, including one man who was ripped from his bicycle by a torrent of water in the eastern village of Ruginesti.\n\nSeveral other people in Europe were missing Friday, including a Belgian beekeeper who was swept away by the current while trying to save his hives from rising waters in the eastern village of Harsin.\n\nThe foul weather has compounded the travel disruptions in France, which is already dealing with the fallout from weeks of strikes and other industrial actions by workers upset over the government's proposed labor reforms. French rail company SNCF said the strikes had led to the cancellation of some 40 percent of the country's high-speed trains.\n\nIn addition, French energy company Enedis says that more than 20,000 customers are without power to the east and south of Paris.\n\nOutside the Louvre, tourists expressed understanding over the museum's closure.\n\n\"It's good that they are evacuating the paintings. It's a shame that we couldn't see them today, but it's right that they do these things,\" said Carlos Santiago, who was visiting from Mexico.",

Here is what\u2019s at stake for the Republicans and the Democrats:\n\nIt has been said before, but this time it may really be true \u2014 this is the last chance for Donald Trump\u2019s foes to stop him from winning the nomination. Trump currently has 996 delegates. He needs a total of 1,237 to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot at the party\u2019s convention in July \u2014 which would likely be his only chance at the nod, as it is thought that in an open convention Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or perhaps even another candidate like Mitt Romney would be nominated.\n\nCruz has no path to the nomination on the first ballot, but he could theoretically stop Trump from getting to 1,237 delegates. But several remaining states \u2014 including California and New Jersey \u2014 are likely to break for Trump. So if Cruz doesn\u2019t take the majority of the delegates in Indiana on Tuesday evening, his plan to Trump may die. The polls currently don\u2019t look good for Cruz, with Trump ahead in Indiana by an average of 10 points.\n\nHillary Clinton has stemmed Bernie Sanders\u2019 rising tide, posting a big win in New York last month and winning another handful of primaries a week later. Still, Sanders is vowing to stay in the race until the party\u2019s convention and fight for superdelegates along the way. If Sanders wins in Indiana, his plan may gain some degree of legitimacy. Sanders is currently trailing in the polls, but by just around 6%. The Vermont senator has outperformed his polling in the region before, so it is possible he\u2019ll do better than expected.",

        "text": "Choosing which 1040 tax form you need to file your return on can be a lot harder to figure out than you'd think, but answering just a few basic questions will lead you to the right version.\n\nFirst of all, if you use tax software to prepare your return, then it will generally take the decision of which tax form to file out of your hands. Instead, the software will evaluate the answers you provide to its list of questions and then select the most appropriate form for your needs.\n\nFor those who prepare their own returns, though, the basic Internal Revenue Service rule is that the best form to file is the simplest one that addresses all of your needs. The 1040EZ is the easiest form to fill out, with the 1040A being more complicated but still less difficult than the full 1040 form.\n\nForm 1040EZ is designed for the simplest returns. In order to use it, you have to meet several requirements.\n\nFirst of all, Form 1040EZ is only available for filing status of single or married filing jointly, and those who have dependents to claim can't use the form. Taxpayers have to be under age 65 and ineligible for higher standard deductions for the blind.\n\nIn addition, there are income-related restrictions. You can't have more than $100,000 in taxable income, and in general, it can only come from wages, salaries, tips, unemployment compensation and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Some taxable interest is allowed, but only if it's less than $1,500 for the year. Alaska residents are also allowed to use 1040EZ even if they receive Permanent Fund dividends from the state.\n\nFinally, the only credit you can claim on the 1040EZ is the Earned Income Credit, and you can't itemize deductions or make any other adjustments to income. Those who received advance payments of premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act aren't eligible to file Form 1040EZ. Those who hire household employees like babysitters or nannies for whom they have to pay employment taxes also can't file 1040EZ, as well as those who are debtors in bankruptcy filings after Oct. 16, 2005.\n\nForm 1040A has some of the same restrictions as 1040EZ. Income has to be less than $100,000, and you still can't itemize deductions. But it's more flexible in other areas. For instance, heads of household, qualifying widows and widowers, and married people filing separately can use Form 1040A.\n\nForm 1040A allows you to include more types of income. In addition to those allowed on 1040EZ, you can have ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions from mutual funds, pension and annuity income, IRA distributions, and taxable Social Security benefits and still file a 1040A. You can also claim deductions for IRA contributions, student loan interest, tuition and fee payments, and expenses that educators pay for supplies for their own classrooms.\n\nYou can also claim more credits on a 1040A. Those seeking credits for child and dependent care expenses, education expenses, and retirement savings contributions can use the form, as can those claiming credits for the elderly or disabled. Both the child tax credit and the additional child tax credit are available to 1040A filers.\n\nLastly, you can handle a limited number of special situations on 1040A. Those receiving dependent care benefits from work can use the form, as can those who have to pay taxes due to having past educational credits recaptured. Even some people who owe alternative minimum taxes can use Form 1040A.\n\nIf you don't qualify for 1040EZ or 1040A treatment, then your only choice is the long Form 1040. Most notably, that includes taxpayers who want to itemize deductions.\n\nFor those who want it, the IRS has developed a tool to help you figure out which form is the simplest available for your needs. You can access it at\n\n, and it will take information from the tax forms you've received from your employer, financial institutions, and other sources to make a recommendation.\n\nFiling your taxes can seem complicated. But by starting with the right form, you'll be able to keep things as simple as possible and avoid biting off more than you need to chew at tax time.",

These five stats explain which industries present the most opportunities as Cuba opens for business.\n\nOne of the immediate benefits of renewed relations with Cuba is the increase in permitted remittance flows. The most recent figures put annual cash remittances to Cuba at approximately $5.1 billion, a level greater than the four fastest growing sectors of the Cuban economy combined. Now, permitted remittance levels from the U.S. will be raised fourfold, from $2,000 to $8,000 per year. This will help drive an increase in spending power in Cuba, which is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 4.6% through this decade. For global companies seeking a foothold anywhere they can, more money in the pockets of Cubans means more fuel for expansion. Take Coca-Cola. With an open Cuba, Coke could be legally be sold in every country in the world save one: North Korea.\n\n(Fortune, The White House, Euromonitor, Wall Street Journal)\n\n2. A lot more visitors\n\nJust 110 miles off the coast of Florida, Cuba should be a natural magnet for American travelers. Despite needing to meet special criteria to receive a visa from the State Department\u2014allowable categories include educational and journalistic activities\u2014170,000 Americans visited the country last year. As the restrictions slacken, the sky is literally the limit. JetBlue already charters flights to Cuba from the U.S., but the budget airline wants to start running regular commercial flights. American Airlines Group now flies to Cuba 20 times per week, a 33% increase in flights compared to just a year ago. More flights\u2014and more competition\u2014will make airfare more affordable, driving additional tourist traffic.\n\n(Travel Pulse, CNN Money, Wall Street Journal)\n\nOnly one in ten Cubans regularly use mobile phones and only one in twenty have uncensored access to the Internet. Even state-restricted Internet penetration currently stands at just 23.2%. The telecom infrastructure is so underdeveloped that an hour of regulated Internet connectivity can cost up to 20% of the average Cuban\u2019s monthly salary. There\u2019s serious demand for the major infrastructure investments needed to improve these numbers. Some start-ups are making waves in spite of shoddy internet. Airbnb, a website that lets people rent out lodging, announced that it has started booking rooms in Cuba with over 1,000 hosts. It gets around the lack of Internet by teaming with middlemen who have long worked to link tourists with bed and breakfasts.\n\n(Wharton, Freedom House, Fast Company)\n\n4. A cure for Cuba\n\nCuba has the third highest number of physicians per capita, behind only Monaco and Qatar. They\u2019re even used as an export: Venezuela pays $5.5 billion a year for the almost 40,000 Cuban medical professionals who now make up half of its health-care personnel. Cuban doctors lack access to most American pharmaceutical products and, importantly, to third-generation antibiotics. For its part, Cuba\u2019s surprisingly robust biotech industry makes a number of vaccines not currently available in the U.S. With the normalization of relations, Cuba can look to fully capitalize on its medical strengths.\n\n(Bloomberg, World Health Organization, Modern Healthcare, Brookings)\n\nCuba currently attracts around $500 million in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014good for just 1% of GDP. Given its tumultuous political history and underdeveloped economy, it is difficult to accurately predict how quickly investors will flock once the embargo has been lifted. But a good comparison might be the Dominican Republic, another Caribbean nation with roughly the same size population as Cuba. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that Cuba could potentially attract as much foreign capital as the Dominican Republic, which currently receives $17 billion in FDI ($2 billion from the U.S). But this won\u2019t happen overnight\u2014in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom, Cuba ranks 177th out of 178, ahead only of North Korea.\n\n(Wharton, ASCE, Peterson Institute, Heritage Foundation)",

        "text": "1. Follow the flows.New research from Stanford Graduate School of Business found evidence that many mutual managers were skilled, but highlighted the importance of finding low-fee active managers. Professors Jonathan Berk and Jules H. van Binsbergen, who has since moved to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, looked at a universe of 5,974 mutual funds from 1969 to 2011 and compared the funds' results to comparable Vanguard index funds. They found evidence of skill\u2014outperformers continued outperforming over time. The researchers also found that the skilled managers attracted more assets\u2014and, in fact, very quickly. If you have a pot of money to invest and are seeking an actively managed fund, one basis you could use to pick is the fund flows, if you're on top of the latest data on at least a quarterly basis, said Berk.\n\n2. Look for fees under 1 percent on actively managed U.S. equity funds. The research also showed that one of the reasons it's been so difficult for experts and investing services to find skilled mutual fund managers is that they charge so much in fees. But at least you know they're out there.\n\nOn average, actively managed equity funds charged investors 1.37 percent in expense ratios in 2013, according to the Investment Company Institute. That's down from 1.6 percent in 2000. On an asset-weighted basis, the decline has been even more significant, because investors have been pouring money into the lowest-priced funds.\n\nIt is possible to find good money managers charging less than 1 percent. In fact, that's what individual investors should look for, suggested Ram Lee, president at New York City-based Seven Bridges Advisors, which has $3.8 billion in assets and offers CIO services to institutions, individuals and families. A lower fee gives you a much better chance of beating the market and is also a sign that a fund company and a manager are aware of the way the wind is blowing: toward lower-priced funds. Rekenthaler's list of five active funds worth a look (included below) all have expense ratios substantially under 1 percent, except for the American Funds' New World Fund, which comes in right above 1 percent.\n\n3. Understand that it's progressively harder for good managers to deliver good returns. In his first five years managing Fidelity's Magellan Fund, according to Berk's paper, famous fund manager Peter Lynch had a 2 percent monthly gross alpha on average assets of about $40 million. In his last five years, his outperformance was only 20 basis points per month on assets that ultimately grew to more than $10 billion.\n\nLynch still had the same level of skill; he just was spreading it thinner. \"As the capital flows in, the alpha goes down,\" said Berk.\n\nAs their funds become larger, managers cannot always find the amount of stock they need in all the right companies to build stellar portfolios for all their clients. That leads to the next idea: You need to know how much money the manager is managing.\n\nThe prospectus will include the total in the fund in which you're investing. But according to Lee, many managers use the same strategy to invest assets outside the fund. So you'll probably want to email the mutual fund company and ask if the manager is also managing assets for institutions. \"Anything above $25 billion is a lot,\" he said.\n\n4. Don't expect the game to be easy. Investors such as Lee personally interview managers and hone their analysis and instincts. Lee, for instance, looks for managers who try to beat the market by understanding downside risk and those who have a system for how they pick the companies they invest in. \"We focus a lot on repeatability of their process,\" Lee said. You won't be able to interview managers, but you can look for detailed letters that describe fund holdings and the manager's strategy.\n\nRekenthaler said it's only in some bear markets that active managers ability to control downside risk has a benefits. \"In 2008, active managers did not do better than indexes. But in 2000 to 2002, the market dropped a lot, led by high-priced tech stocks. A lot of active managers that outperformed substantially avoided the one big market sector, technology.\"\n\nOne thing Lee doesn't look at: labels, like growth vs.value. Those labels are determined by a fund's holdings and thus can easily change even within a year.\n\n5. Finally, don't forget the taxes. Many professional investors look for managers who aim to buy and hold companies for the long term, so take a look at the fund turnover, too. \"On taxable portfolios, the tax consequences of a high-turnover approach\" could erase any of the returns you've earned above the market, said Jonathan Blau, CEO of Fusion Family Wealth.",

His gravitational pull was so strong that even Drake had no choice but collaborate with him on the summer release \u201cWhat a Time to Be Alive.\u201d\n\nWhen Future sat down with DJ Khaled Friday night on the first episode of Khaled\u2019s new Beats 1 Radio show, the agenda included more than just mutual back-patting for newly-signed, presumably lucrative deals with Apple Music (\u201cWhen I got the deal, I said, \u2018Sensational!\u2019 \u201d Future said, embodying his own meme.) Future was also set to unveil what would be his seventh project in barely over a year.\n\nKhaled, whose talent as a DJ has been overshadowed lately by his SnapChat phenomenon, had Future\u2019s latest album, \u201cEVOL,\u201d in his hands, and it was as if they both were admiring bottled lightning. The album, which was made available to preorder for release at midnight, comes three weeks ahead of his Purple Reign Tour stop in Boston on Feb. 26. It also comes barely three weeks after Future no-so-coincidentally dropped off the 13-track surprise tape, \u201cPurple Reign,\u201d just hours before his ex-fiancee Ciara\u2019s new flame, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, opened up the NFL playoffs. (The Seahawks lost; memes ensued.)\n\nFuture and Khaled talked about the meaning of the album title \u2013 \u201cLove\u201d backward, as well as evolution. But with Future\u2019s tip-toeing on the fine line between harnessing bottled-lightning inspiration and clutching onto short attention spans while he knows he has them, they also talked about how much Future music was flooding the market.\n\nFuture explained the logic behind constantly feeding fans and clubs alike. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit and have them wonder if I love them; I want to show them immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that moment it was clear that for Future, oversaturation doesn\u2019t matter if he could defy it.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t DMX in the late \u201990s, dropping three albums in 20 months (all hit No. 1), but then eventually crashing into a wall. He wasn\u2019t millennial machine Curren$y, putting six albums a year into the air like a running stream of consciousness. Future was dictating his own terms.\n\n\u201cWhen you look back at Future and his career,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to be like, he set the tone, he set the vibe for his own career.\u201d\n\nHe was more than aware that last year\u2019s \u201cDirty Sprite 2\u201d was his tipping point. On the strength of next-generation trap beats that morphed and mutated into something both sinister and soulful, \u201cDS2\u201d was unlike anything else. But in terms of narration, it was the climax of a story Future had been weaving for months. \u201cWhere Ya At\u201d was exquisite because of the way producer Metro Boomin managed to contort the strings from Stan Getz\u2019s sensuous 1960 slow-burner \u201cGoodbye\u201d into an absolute earthquake. But it was also gripping, one of the flashpoint moments when Future wasn\u2019t binging on drugs but purging the feelings of abandonment and loss that he was trying to escape.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dirty Sprite 2,\u2019 I feel like they got me,\u201d he told Khaled. \u201cI marked my territory with \u2018DS2.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cEVOL\u201d keeps listeners in the same frame, even if the emotions aren\u2019t as driven. At one point, on the album opener \u201cAin\u2019t No Time,\u201d he admits to the push and pull of his music\u2019s infectiousness and indecipherability: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we be saying / We just be yelling out, \u2018bon jour.\u2019 \u201d There\u2019s less distress, more hedonism.\n\nThe only leftover trace of whatever bitterness he may still feel shows up on \u201cLow Life,\u201d featuring the Weeknd. How Future\u2019s love-stoned spiral hasn\u2019t intersected with the Weeknd\u2019s walk-of-shame sensibilities until now is hard to fathom, but he raps shamelessly, \u201cIf she catch me cheating, I won\u2019t ever tell her sorry.\u201d\n\nFuture\u2019s still comfortable in the zone he fell into 20 months ago, so much so that he told Khaled he doesn\u2019t even remember how many albums he\u2019s released.\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to continue to build. I\u2019ve got to continue to move on.\u201d\n\nThe thing about momentum, though, is that as exciting as it is to watch it build, the inevitable question is: When will it eventually run out?",

Heck, even I convinced myself that a modest taper was likely.\n\nBut the Fed has always insisted it was data-dependent.

Bernanke, in response to a question from Greg Ip, said, \"We are discussing how we might clarify the guidance on the federal funds rate.\" He specifically mentioned having a floor for inflation.\n\nBut what the market really wants is a blueprint for exactly what they will be doing in the coming months.

Bouchard ruled that the social network\u2019s minority shareholders are entitled to their day in court over the salaries that Facebook\u2019s directors received.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the company\u2019s board are being sued because a shareholder thinks the pay the directors were awarded in 2013 was too high. Board members decide their own pay, but in this case, the dispute is over whether it was excessive and whether the board acted in shareholders\u2019 interests.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Zuckerberg, who owns a majority of Facebook\u2019s shares, signed an affidavit saying he approved the pay. In a deposition related to the case, he said: \u201cThese are the people who I want and\u2014and who I think will serve the company best, and I think that the compensation plan that we have is doing its job of attracting and retaining them over the long term.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s lawyers claimed that was enough under Delaware law to conclude the majority of shareholders had approved the director pay packages. That matters under Delaware law (where Facebook and many large corporations are incorporated), because unless shareholders have approved the directors\u2019 pay, the Facebook board has to show the pay was fair. But if shareholders approved board members\u2019 pay, they could rely on a presumption that they exercised sound business judgement.\n\nThe judge said not so fast. Just because Zuckerberg signed an affidavit and spoke in a deposition doesn\u2019t mean Facebook is entitled to an easier case.\n\nDelaware law is pretty loose when it comes to shareholder approval. It can be done at a shareholder meeting, by unanimous consent of shareholders, or even by majority shareholder consent \u201cwithout a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote,\u201d Bouchard wrote.\n\nBut Bouchard said protocols under the law on when Zuckerberg was speaking for shareholders matter. To use the majority shareholder consent provision, Zuckerberg not only had to make it clear for whom he was speaking and that he was entitled to speak for the majority, he also had to disclose his action to shareholders following his decision. \u201cIn the case of action taken by written consent, [shareholders are entitled] to receive prompt notice after the fact of the action taken,\u201d the judge wrote. According to the judge, these requirements protect the corporation and its shareholders.\n\nThe rights of minority shareholders are critical to corporate governance. In fact, it\u2019s one area of governance that countries across the globe have been able to agree on. It\u2019s that basic. So because minority shareholders did not get their due, including receiving notice of Zuckerberg\u2019s actions, this case is going forward, as it should.\n\nEleanor Bloxham is CEO of The Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance (http://www.thevaluealliance.com), an independent board education and advisory firm she founded in 1999.

        "text": "Princess Masako gave birth to Princess Aiko in 2001, after which the pressure to have a boy only increased. That is believed to have caused what the Imperial Household Agency said last year was the princess's depression and anxiety. The princess, who has received therapy, has rarely been seen in public since the end of 2003.\n\nUnder the current system, a son from Emperor Akihito's other son, Prince Akishino, 40, could ascend. But Prince Akishino and his wife, Princess Kiko, have two daughters, and, despite prodding from the Imperial Household Agency, are not believed to be trying for a third child.\n\nRecent opinion polls show that most Japanese overwhelmingly back the idea of an empress, though support dips for a female line.\n\nAccording to Japanese myth, the first emperor, Jimmu, a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, began his reign 2,665 years ago; historians, though, trace the start of Japan's imperial system to the fourth or fifth century.\n\nSome opponents of establishing a female imperial line cite that ancient precedent. Tsuneyasu Takeda, 30, a member of a former imperial family branch, said Japan should no more alter Horyu Temple, its oldest wooden building, than interfere with the throne's unbroken male bloodline.\n\n\"Why not rebuild Horyu Temple as a concrete building?\" said Mr. Takeda, author of the recently published book \"The Truth About the Imperial Family.\" He answered himself: \"If you did, it would be something completely different.\"\n\nThe emperor, Mr. Takeda said, was valued \"not because he is intelligent or handsome.\"\n\n\"It's because he is the inheritor of the blood that has been preserved for 2,000 years,\" he said.\n\nOther opponents add genetics to their argument. Since women have two X chromosomes while men have an X and a Y, the imperial throne's male line has preserved its Y chromosome intact.\n\n\"Maintaining the male line is the condition to preserving that Y chromosome,\" said Hakubun Shimomura, a lawmaker for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, who is one of the leaders of a campaign to reject the panel's recommendation.\n\n\"The bloodline is important for the emperor to be a symbol of the nation and the unity of the people,\" Mr. Shimomura added. \"This symbolic imperial throne preserves Japan's culture and tradition in total. The imperial throne is Japan itself.\"\n\nLike many other opponents, Mr. Shimomura does not oppose Princess Aiko's ascension to the throne, as long as a male with the right Y chromosome will succeed her. Princess Aiko would be a \"pinch hitter,\" he added, the same way the previous eight empresses had been.\n\nBut where to find the right Y? During the American postwar occupation, two groups that had ensured male heirs over the centuries were abolished: other imperial branch families, like Mr. Takeda's, and concubines, who are said to have given birth to about half of past emperors.\n\nReacting against the panel, a cousin of the current emperor, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, 59, wrote that those two groups should be resurrected to maintain the throne's male lineage. \"I wholeheartedly support it,\" the prince wrote about a revival of the concubine system, \"but I think that the social mood inside and outside the country may make it a little difficult.\"\n\n\"Unless we carefully hold and express opinions regarding 2,665 years of history and tradition, we'll move in the direction of changing Japan's 'national essence,' \" the prince wrote. \"Furthermore, one day, arguments that the imperial system is not needed will even emerge.\"\n\nBut some supporters of the panel's recommendations say that a female line would bring badly needed equality to a society where a woman is still expected to join a man's family upon marriage, take his family name and be buried in his family's grave.\n\nFor most of the throne's history, emperors lived quietly in Kyoto. But during the Meiji Restoration of the late 1800's, as Japan tried to modernize and catch up with the West, Emperor Meiji was brought to the forefront to try to unify Japan; his grandson, Emperor Hirohito, who died in 1989, was considered divine until Japan's defeat in World War II.\n\nMikiyo Kano, a professor of women's history at Keiwa College, said that after Meiji, the emperor and his wife were held up as models for the Japanese. Starting with Meiji and until Japan's defeat, emperors dressed in military uniforms, while their wives promoted the Red Cross and patriotic associations.\n\n\"I think the male succession system in the imperial family has led to the discrimination and oppression of women in general in Japan,\" Ms. Kano said. A female line would make a woman the symbolic leader of the nation and show a man deferring to her, as wives of emperors do, she said.\n\n\"If Princess Aiko became empress, it might be a little better for the realization of the equality of men and women, rather than clinging to the male line,\" Ms. Kano said. \"I'm basically for ending this system where wives always stand back while the emperor speaks, or walk behind him. That kind of image says a lot to ordinary people.\"",

        "summary": "Government panel in Japan recommends that American-imposed Imperial Household Law of 1947 be revised to allow female line to hold throne; although neither of current emperor's two sons is likely to produce male heir, suggestion by panel ignites furious debate over imperial system and its significance to Japan, and over topics as varied as status of Japanese women, merits of concubine system and purity of imperial Y chromosome; panel's recommendation, if adopted by Parliament, would clear way for Princess Aiko, emperor's 4-year-old granddaughter, to one day ascend to throne and have her own firstborn succeed her; recent opinion polls show most Japanese back idea of empress, though support dips for female line; photo (M)"

And former No. 1 overall pick Mychal Thompson retired, playing only one game of the series. He left the NBA with averages of 13.7 points and 7.4 rebounds, underwhelming for a player selected five spots ahead of Larry Bird.\n\nBut don't feel bad for Thompson. He played a year in Italy and then moved back to Portland, where he had started his career, with his 2-year-old son, Klay. Klay, three inches shorter than his father at 6-7, developed into an elite NBA shooter. He met Stephen Curry, son of one of Mychal's NBA contemporaries, Dell Curry. The two became the Splash Brothers, and the rest is history.\n\nJackson says the dads not being superstars is an important part of that history.\n\n\"For these people who don't know Mychal Thompson or Dell Curry, neither one of them was a great success coming into the game,\" Jackson said, on a panel with Shaquille O'Neal hosted by Hannah Storm, presented by American Express. \"They faced hardship. Mychal was the first pick of the draft. He did not have immediate success. His success came when he went to the Lakers and won championships. Dell was an expansion player, from Cleveland to Charlotte. We always loved his shot. He was a great shooter, but he never really had that great success.\"\n\nDell averaged 11.7 points in 16 seasons. He won a Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1993-94, but he only started 99 of 1,083 career games. Like Mychal, he retired with solid, but not spectacular statistics.\n\nJackson has never coached Klay Thompson or Stephen Curry, but he worked with the ultimate example of non-superstar NBA player having a son that developed into an elite performer.\n\n\"I always thought about Kobe [Bryant],\" Jackson says. \"His father was a player that lasted a couple years in the NBA and then went over to Italy and never really had the success he wanted or felt he deserved. I think the children of those type of parents really have a drive to overrun their father, to do better than their father, to knock the king off the throne.\"\n\nBryant's father, Joe, was the No. 14 pick in the 1975 NBA draft by the Warriors and was traded to the 76ers before his first game. Joe averaged 8.7 points in eight NBA seasons before playing eight years in Europe. Kobe was a bit more successful.\n\nLikewise, Stephen and Klay have already surpassed their dads, regardless of how this NBA Finals turns out. Both are All-Stars who have led their team to championships.\n\nPerhaps raising sons more skilled than themselves are Mychal and Dell's most prideful basketball accomplishments.\n\nMore NBA: -- Klay Thompson: We're Better Than Showtime Lakers -- Riley Curry Rules Stephen's Emoji App -- Here's What Curry Said To Durant After Game 7\n\nFollow Jeffrey Eisenband on Twitter @JeffEisenband.\n\nBasketball, Dad, Dell Curry, Golden State Warriors, Joe Bryant, Klay Thompson, Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers, mychal thompson, NBA, Phil Jackson, Stephen Curry",

Revised financial statements, additional underwriters, the specific number of shares being offered, etc.\n\nOne thing that almost always remains constant, however, is the bank that\u2019s in charge (otherwise known as the \u201cleft lead,\u201d due to its physical position on the registration document). Unless that bank disappears \u2014 think Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers in 2010 \u2014 companies stick with the one that brung \u2019em.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so surprising when Reuters recently reported that Deutsche Bank DB had quit as left lead for an upcoming IPO for iWatt, a California maker power management semiconductors.\n\niWatt had filed for the $75 million offering just a few weeks earlier. Not the sort of deal that would generate major headlines, but it was still a (barely) profitable tech company with high-profile venture capital investors like VantagePoint Venture Partners and Sigma Partners. More importantly, Deutsche Bank likely would have banked a couple million dollars.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the dispute centered around valuation. The article doesn\u2019t get more specific, but its suggestion is that iWatt CEO Ron Edgerton felt the company was worth more than did Deutsche Bank.\n\nSounds like a good cause for divorce, but the story I\u2019m hearing is much different. Multiple sources familiar with the situation tell me that iWatt and Deutsche had not yet begun to seriously discuss price. Instead, they were simply deciding whether or not iWatt should even move full-steam ahead with an IPO at this point in time. The company wanted to push forward, while the bank wanted to hold back.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear is Deutsche\u2019s hesitance was born of macro or internal issues. The former could include Europe\u2019s daily proclivity for causing havoc in U.S. markets, or the fact that no U.S. company had gone public since Facebook priced in May 18 (note: that dry spell was snapped on Tuesday night). Indeed, many companies have postponed, or even withdrawn IPO registrations over the past several weeks.\n\nThe latter could simply be that Deutsche Bank had too much other business on its plate right now, and iWatt got pushed down the list of priorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was Facebook fallout or something else, but the whole thing was just very strange,\u201d one source said. \u201cFrom my perspective, everyone just should have waited to see if ServiceNow was able to price, since it also was a VC-backed, non-consumer tech company.\u201d\n\n[Note: ServiceNow NOW priced its IPO last night at $18 per share, and was trading at $23.86 as of this writing].\n\nWhat we know for sure, however, is that several other bulge-bracket banks inquired about replacing Deutsche Bank as the left lead. The company currently is in serious discussions with at least one of them, although it also may simply promote Barclays Bank to sole lead underwriter status. Barclays had been listed to the right of Deutsche in the original registration statement, with smaller banks Canaccord Genuity, Baird and Needham & Co. on the second line.\n\nBoth iWatt and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\n\nSign up for Dan\u2019s daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com",

The drama in the film is inter-human, between Moses and Pharaoh than between God and Pharaoh.\n\n3. The Bible: Moses flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave.\n\nThe Film: Moses is kicked out of Egypt when Pharaoh realizes Moses is a Hebrew.

        "text": "This piece originally appeared on STATnews.com.\n\nA boy in Pakistan became a local legend as a street performer in recent years by traversing hot coals and lancing his arms with knives without so much as a wince. A thousand miles away, in China, lived a family wracked by excruciating bouts of inexplicable pain, passed down generation after generation.\n\nScientists eventually determined what the boy and the family had in common: mutations in a gene that functions like an on-off switch for agony. Now, a bevy of biotech companies, including Genentech and Biogen biib , are staking big money on the idea that they can develop drugs that toggle that switch to relieve pain without the risk of addiction.\n\nThe gene in question is SCN9A, which is responsible for producing a pain-related protein called Nav1.7. In patients who feel nothing, SCN9A is pretty much broken. In those who feel searing random pain, the gene is cranking out far too much Nav1.7.\n\nThat discovery raises an obvious question: Can blocking Nav1.7 provide relief for many types of pain \u2014 and someday, perhaps, replace dangerous opioid therapies?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the dream,\u201d said David Hackos, a senior scientist at Genentech, which has two Nav1.7 treatments in the first stage of clinical development.\n\nIt\u2019s too early make any sweeping predictions \u2014 and, indeed, a Pfizer pill targeting Nav1.7 has already stumbled \u2014 but the pharma industry clearly sees the potential for a blockbuster.\n\nFor more on Health and Technology, watch this video:\n\nLast year, Biogen paid $200 million for a firm called Convergence Pharmaceuticals to get its hands on some Nav1.7 inhibitors. Amgen amgn is in the early stages with a similar project. And Purdue Pharma, the controversial maker of opioid therapy OxyContin, launched a joint venture last year specifically focused on Nav1.7 drugs.\n\nEach is betting that this novel approach to pain relief could upend the standard of care for chronic aches, which are now often treated with weak anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or with opioids, which bring serious side effects and the potential for abuse.\n\nOpioid prescriptions have more than quadrupled since 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioid abuse kills about 30,000 Americans each year, according to the agency, and about half of those deaths result from prescribed therapies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous need for innovative, effective, and safe treatment modalities,\u201d said Dr. Jianguo Cheng, vice president of scientific affairs at the American Academy of Pain Medicine. \u201cIf it\u2019s truly effective, it could be revolutionary.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s early days yet for Nav1.7, and investigators have much to prove before anyone can pencil in billion-dollar sales.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of how good the target is, it\u2019s going to be tough sailing,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Waxman, a professor of neurology at Yale Medical School and West Haven Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nSide effects, for instance, will need to be closely scrutinized, Waxman said. The pain-free patients born with faulty SCN9A genes are otherwise pretty much normal, but no one really knows what will happen to healthy patients when their Nav1.7 is blocked. Only a sizable clinical trial can determine for sure, Waxman said.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s hard to know when pain drugs are working. Many fields of drug development rely on biomarkers, measurable reactions that tell researchers whether their efforts are having an effect. In chronic pain, no such standards exist, Waxman said, forcing scientists to use less reliable measures like patient surveys.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of placebo effect. High among the major impediments to developing new pain treatments is the sudden, baffling rise in sugar pill efficacy. Last year, researchers in Canada surveyed pain trials over 23 years and discovered that while active drugs performed pretty much the same, placebos grew more and more effective.\n\nAnd the Nav1.7 field already has at least one clinical disappointment on the books.\n\nA pill tested by Pfizer did well in patients with inherited erythromelalgia, the genetic condition found in the Chinese family, but had little effect on dental pain. A later study testing the same pill on nerve pain related to diabetes was similarly disappointing, and Pfizer quietly shelved the effort last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating area,\u201d said Douglas Krafte, who worked on the program. \u201cThe science has been so fascinating, and the drug discovery has been challenging.\u201d\n\nKrafte, who is now the chief scientist at the pharma contractor Icagen, believes there\u2019s plenty reason to be optimistic that Nav1.7 will pan out. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right way to approach it.\n\n\u201cThis is just part of the process of making a new kind of pain drug,\u201d said Genentech\u2019s Hackos. \u201cIt\u2019s one that may take years, but we\u2019re making a lot of progress.\u201d",

        "text": "The Chicago teachers strike has put Democrats in a difficult position. Teacher unions are the most powerful constituency in the Democratic Party, but their interests are ever more clearly at odds with taxpayers and inner-city families. Chicago is reviving scenes from the last crisis of liberalism in the 1970s, when municipal unions drove many American cities to disorder and bankruptcy. Where did their power come from?\n\nBefore the 1950s, government-employee unions were almost inconceivable. When the Boston police unionized and went on strike in 1919, the ensuing chaos\u2014rioting and looting\u2014crippled the public-union idea. Massachusetts Gov. Calvin Coolidge became a national hero by breaking the strike, issuing the dictum: \"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.\" President Woodrow Wilson called the strike \"an intolerable crime against civilization.\"\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt also rejected government unionism. He told the head of the Federation of Federal Employees in 1937 that collective bargaining \"cannot be transplanted into the public service. The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer\" because \"the employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws.\"\n\nFDR pointed out the obvious, that the government is sovereign. If an organization can compel the government to do something, then that organization will be the real sovereign. Thus the National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act of 1935 gave private-sector unions the power to compel employers to bargain, but the act excluded government workers. It declared that federal and state and local governments were not \"employers\" under its terms.\n\nPostwar prosperity and the great increase of public employment revived the public union idea. By 1970, nearly 20% of American workers worked for the government. (In 1900: 4%.) The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees led the effort to persuade a state to allow public-employee unionization, and Afscme prevailed in Wisconsin in 1958. New York City and other cities also permitted their workers to unionize.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy issued an executive order 50 years ago that broke the dam. The order did not permit federal employees to bargain over wages (these are still set by Congress), or to force workers to join a union or to strike (no state or city allowed that), but Kennedy's directive did lead to unionization of the federal workforce. And it gave great impetus to more liberal state and local laws. Government-union membership rose tenfold in the 1960s.\n\nThings soon got ugly. The Wagner Act had fomented labor militancy, notably sit-down strikes in 1937 that disrupted manufacturing and retarded the economy. But in the late 1960s and 1970s, federal and state union-promoting laws produced unprecedented strikes by teachers, garbage collectors, postal workers and others, even though every state prohibited strikes by public employees.\n\nAfscme began to arouse resentment from other union federations\u2014especially the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees International Union. Afscme's abrasive president, Jerry Wurf, became an easy target for his opponents. He was said to have advised Baltimore firefighters to \"let Baltimore burn\" if union demands were not met; Wurf was subsequently regarded as generally having a let-it-burn attitude.\n\nIn 1976 the Supreme Court derailed a movement to enact the National Public Employment Relations Law (\"a Wagner Act for public employees,\" as supporters described it) led by Rep. William Clay of Missouri. The court held that Congress could not apply federal labor laws to state employees. The justices stated the obvious, that \"the States as states stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation.\"\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, the budgetary burdens imposed by public unions had helped revive conservative movements, leading to the elections of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. Undeterred, William Clay told the Professional Air Traffic Controllers at Patco's 1980 convention to \"revise your political thinking. It should start with the premise that you have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests. It must be selfish and pragmatic.\" He told them to \"learn the rules of the game,\" which were \"that you don't put the interest of any other group ahead of your own. What's good for the federal employees must be interpreted as being good for the nation.\" The take-no-prisoners message helps explain why President Reagan fired and replaced the striking controllers, and why the public overwhelmingly supported him.\n\nHistorians tend to depict the Patco strike as a replay of the 1919 Boston police strike, with Reagan as the new Coolidge. But breaking the Patco strike had zero impact on public unionism. It may have cooled the willingness to strike, but unions continued to flourish. Public employment and government unionism have grown more than the population since 1980. The Patco replacements soon joined the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and carried on Patco's work.\n\nNor did the breaking of the strike \"send a signal\" to private employers to take a hard line against their unions, as some historians of the time have suggested. The factors responsible for private-union decline antedated the Patco strike and continued after it. Reagan ultimately may have even helped the public-employee union movement: By stoking the nation's economic revival in the 1980s, he made the costs of public unions begin to seem less onerous, and polls suggested that American worries about the matter declined.\n\nPublic unions do well in flush times like the 1950s and 1960s, but they suffer when taxpayers feel their true cost, as in the 1970s\u2014and today.\n\nMr. Moreno, a professor of history at Hillsdale College, is the author of \"The American State from the Civil War to the New Deal,\" forthcoming from Cambridge University Press.",

        "text": "After he resigned as Conservative leader in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith found a new purpose in his quest for social justice. That cause inspired him to co-found the Centre for Social Justice and brought him back to frontline politics, despite his bruising experience in the leader\u2019s chair. Ultimately, it also led him to resign from the government on Friday, as his frustration at what he saw as endless obstruction from the Treasury boiled over.\n\nAll former cabinet ministers find that the transition to the backbenches leaves them with spare time and energy. Some write books, some go on the speaking circuit and others commit it all to seeking a route back to the top table. Duncan Smith will presumably commit to the campaign to leave the European Union, a cause which has long been close to his heart. That\u2019s not to say he will stop talking about social reform and start talking about Brexit \u2013 rather, he has a unique opportunity to explain why a Leave vote would help Britain become a fairer society.\n\nThe early skirmishes of the referendum campaign have largely focused on either macro-policy, like international trade rules, or micro-frippery, like the views of the monarch. As the debate gets into full swing, both sides will need to explain how their preferred outcome will directly affect voters\u2019 day-to-day lives.\n\nWelfare and work are an essential part of that picture \u2013 and there is an as-yet-unheard case that both could be improved by voting to leave. Duncan Smith has long argued that constructing a fairer society requires money and the freedom to reform the welfare system. Leaving the EU would provide both. Ultimately, the referendum in June is about control \u2013 control of our laws, our public policy and our public spending. On each front, EU membership compromises Britain\u2019s ability to act freely and flexibly to address its social problems.\n\nThe government itself sought through the renegotiation to regain power over who can claim welfare in the UK. The two central requests were set out in the Conservative manifesto \u2013 that benefits should not be paid for those children whose parents work here but who do not themselves live in this country, and that new arrivals should work for four years before they become eligible to access the welfare system. These were modest and popular demands, endorsed in a general election, but the EU still rejected them, watering down each so heavily that the process more closely resembled policy homeopathy than a renegotiation.\n\nThat failure sent a clear message about the reality of EU membership \u2013 we have lost the right to define the rules of our own welfare state, and have thus lost the ability to manage its costs or focus its resources as we wish.\n\nWhatever your preference might be regarding the size and nature of the welfare system, it is hard to argue that the voters who fund it and use it should not have democratic control of its terms and scope. During the renegotiation, Duncan Smith identified the four-year waiting period before migrant workers could access benefits as \u201ccrucial\u201d, and with good reason. With a stubbornly large deficit, there is no unlimited source of money for the welfare state; therefore, the greater the number of people who have the right to claim benefits, the less money there can be for each recipient. If one argues, as he does, that a permanent improvement in the lives of those in the greatest need requires the allocation of sizeable up-front resources, then allowing unlimited access to in-work benefits for EU migrants reduces the opportunity to deliver a new life for those in the direst need.\n\nOne of the passages in the work and pensions secretary\u2019s resignation letter which will have caused the most pain in Downing Street will be the charge that the government\u2019s fiscal priorities are skewed \u2013 not least that they protect benefits for better-off pensioners while cutting from the young.\n\nThat argument, too, can extend to our EU membership \u2013 it is both absurd and unjust to pay such vast amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money to Brussels while battling to reduce spending on public services at home.\n\nAll the political agony and fury of the coalition years saw a total of \u00a317bn saved from the welfare budget. And yet last year our gross contribution to the EU exceeded \u00a319bn. Even if a post-Brexit government wanted to continue all EU spending \u2013 an unlikely circumstance given the wasteful way in which Brussels spends much of our money \u2013 that would leave a net saving of over \u00a310bn.\n\nDuncan Smith would be justified in arguing that it is more socially just to take money from well-paid Eurocrats than from British welfare recipients.\n\nMark Wallace is executive editor of ConservativeHome",

        "text": "As public spending cuts have an impact across European and North American countries, the debate over the value of overseas aid is reaching new levels of intensity, no more so than in the United Kingdom where the Coalition has pledged to ringfence and increase the aid budget to reach 0.7 per cent of its Gross National Income from 2013. The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan adds a new and urgent perspective, tragically showing how even a rich and developed nation can find itself in need of external humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe debate encourages us to think about the role of foreign aid in developing countries \u2013 its potential, its benefits, as well as its possible pitfalls. Is foreign aid affordable? Does the need for foreign aid outweigh domestic calls on public spending? Will it reduce poverty or instead be lost to corruption? Will it lead to a culture of dependency? These are critical questions for governments and the public they represent, and I would like to add my thoughts both from the perspective of President of Liberia and Goodwill Ambassador for Water and Sanitation in Africa.\n\nWhether you measure poverty by the one and a half billion people living on less than a pound a day, the one billion who go hungry each day, or other indicators such as the eight million children who die each year from preventable diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, poverty on the scale it exists today is an affront to our common humanity. It also carries a significance beyond national borders and is therefore of global importance. In an increasingly interlinked world, countries are more dependent on one another for their prosperity, security and safety, and to answer challenges such as climate change.\n\nI have seen, at first\u2013hand, how aid, effectively targeted and delivered, reduces poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa there have been major improvements in child health and in primary school enrolment over the last two decades. To choose one example, between 1999 and 2004, the continent achieved one of the largest reductions in measles\u2019 deaths ever seen. These positive results and outcomes would not have been possible without the support of donors such as the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), complementing the resources which low-income countries mobilize domestically. In my own country, Liberia, both humanitarian and development aid have helped us recover and rebuild from the devastation and trauma of civil war, improving the future for the millions directly involved and affected.\n\nThe British public is right to demand that their aid be corruption-free. It is the poor who bear the heaviest burden of corruption \u2013 it pushes them further into poverty, and deepens inequality and injustice. Corruption is a continual risk to progress, and combating it must be a joint endeavour pursued tirelessly by developed and developing countries. In Liberia, I declared a zero tolerance on corruption when I assumed office, and I continue to stand by this declaration. I believe passionately that all governments receiving aid have an enduring obligation to ensure that it is properly used. When they do so, and their anti-corruption efforts complement donor transparency and independent monitoring such as adopted by DFID, I have no doubt that aid can and does achieve its essential objectives.\n\nCitizens in both the North and South also have a right to demand that aid achieves value for money, and in this light I am pleased to see that DFID has identified increasing the number of people with access to clean water and sanitation as a top priority for Liberia as well as other African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi and Mozambique. There can be few more important and effective interventions, as diarrhoea, caused by lack of access to these basic human rights, is the biggest killer of children under five in Africa. With access to safe water and sanitation, lives are saved, health outcomes are improved, more children, especially girls, can go to school, and stability thrives. It is hardly surprising that the United Nations Development Programme estimates that for every \u00a31 invested in water and sanitation, \u00a38 is returned to the economy through increased productivity.\n\nThe UK has a long-sustained dedication to reducing poverty, inequality and inequity in the developing world, and for this the public should be proud. And whilst it can only be right in the current context that aid budgets in all donor countries undergo increased scrutiny, and that strong results and value for money are both demanded and expected, I believe it would be a fatal mistake for governments to adopt aid-sceptic or, worse still, anti-aid approaches.\n\nAid should, of course, never be an end in itself.

        "text": "There are two great themes running through this book. One is Jerry Lee\u2019s love-hate relationship with Elvis; the other is his struggle with the Devil.\n\nLewis arrived at Sun determined to topple Elvis from his throne as the king of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2013 and for a brief while he did. Shortly before departing for army service in Germany, Lewis claims, a tearful Presley bequeathed him his crown, saying, \u201cYou got it. Take it. Take the whole damn thing.\u201d\n\nWhile Elvis meekly allowed himself to be tamed and neutered by the egregious Colonel Tom Parker, Lewis \u2013 whom nobody ever described as \u201cmeek\u201d \u2013 remained the authentic article. In 1977, the day after Elvis died, Lewis was asked by a reporter what he felt on hearing the news. He replied: \u201cGlad. Just another one out of the way. I mean, Elvis this, Elvis that. All we hear is Elvis. What the s--- did Elvis ever do except take dope I couldn\u2019t get a hold of?\u201d He now explains that he was drunk, \u201cand hurting and angry\u201d. The truth is \u201cI loved Elvis\u201d. But not so much as to hand him back the crown. Pondering how they rank in the pantheon of music, Lewis remains unbowed: \u201cAfter me was Elvis.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019s upbringing was Pentecostal Christian \u2013 of the vengeful Jehovah rather than the gentle Jesus school. The fear of divine retribution did not, as Bragg delicately puts it, mean that he would grow up to adhere to the teachings, \u201cjust that he knew in his heart when he did wrong\u201d. Which was frequently.\n\nThe question that seems to have most tormented him, however, was whether you could play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and still go to heaven. When a troubled Lewis asked Elvis, who had come from an identical background, the question, Elvis's face, he claims, \u201cturned blood red\u201d and he snapped back: \u201cDon\u2019t you never ask me that again.\u201d\n\nIt behoves any writer contemplating the state of Lewis\u2019s soul to write in cadences pitched somewhere between southern-fried folk wisdom and the Book of Revelation \u2013 and Bragg rises manfully to the challenge. \u201cThe demons even outran the music, and he found he could not run fast enough to beat them and still hold the road,\u201d he writes.\n\nEven allowing for the fact that an authorised biography will err towards generosity, this book is hardly a character reference. Lewis emerges as cantankerous, boastful, threatening, possibly sociopathic. But Bragg remains ever-understanding.\n\nOne can well recognise, as Bragg puts it, that \u201cas a southern man\u201d, Lewis required guns \u201cin the same way other men require a pocket watch and suspenders\u201d; and shooting his bass player might well have been an accident. But still, one can\u2019t help thinking there was something decidedly careless in his handling of firearms. Having passed the time one night by shooting at random into a wall of his office, he awoke, hung-over, the next day to discover that the bullets had destroyed a display case of antique dentures in the dental practice next door. \u201cHe was relieved to find they were not actually in someone\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nHis greatest violence, however, was reserved for himself. Much of this book has all the appalling, rubbernecking fascination of a car crash \u2013 something with which Lewis, a man who \u201chad never seen anything wrong with going out and driving off a good drunk\u201d, was all too familiar. His drug consumption reads like a pharmaceutical manual: biphetamines, Placidyls, Desbutal.\n\nThe litany of tragedy is similarly stupefying. One son died in a swimming pool. So did his fourth wife. Another son died in a road accident. By way of consolation, the women (countless) \u201cwere always sympathetic with me\u201d. At the age of 47, he married a 25-year-old, Shawn Stephens, who two months later was found dead in her bed. An autopsy revealed the painkiller methadone in her system at 10 times the normal dose. A grand jury reviewed the case but could find no grounds for indictment. In 1984, doctors cut away a third of Lewis\u2019s stomach after he was diagnosed with perforated ulcers. In 1986, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, looking \u201clike a man who had walked through a fire and been put out just in time\u201d.\n\nMiraculously, in 2008, he returned to the Top 30 with an album featuring guest artists including Keith Richards, B B King and Bruce Springsteen. At the age of 79, having finally kicked his addiction to pills and whatever else, \u201cThe Killer\u201d now passes much of his time in repose, lying in bed at his ranch, with his guns on the dressing table and an ill-tempered chihuahua named Topaz Junior on the quilt between his feet.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story by Rick Bragg\n\n512pp, Canongate, Telegraph offer price: \u00a317 (PLUS \u00a31.95 p&p) (RRP \u00a320, ebook \u00a38.54) .

        "text": "\"I used to think I was this made man,\" says entrepreneur Glenn Kelman. \"That's what they tell you after you take a company public.\"\n\nIn 1996 Mr. Kelman co-founded Plumtree, a business-software firm that went public in 2002. After that, he assumed that his next idea was as good as paid for.\n\n\"Whatever I thought of, they'd fund it,\" he says.\n\nThen, in 2006, Mr. Kelman became chief executive of a real-estate startup, Redfin Corp.\n\nRedfin sounds like it would be catnip for technology investors. The company aims to overhaul how people buy and sell houses, using software and data to improve real-estate agents' customer service. Real estate is an opaque, expensive insider's game\u2014exactly the kind of business that is ripe for getting blown up by a less-expensive, more-convenient Web-powered service.\n\n\"We wanted to change the whole thing in the consumers' favor,\" Mr. Kelman says, his voice straining with a revolutionary's passion. \"We wanted you to have an agent who was on your side, who used technology the whole way through the process and who charged half the price.\"\n\nBut whenever Mr. Kelman shopped his plan in Silicon Valley, venture capitalists looked at him funny. He raised millions of dollars, but the money came fitfully, often at lower valuations than he expected.\n\nEventually Mr. Kelman realized the problem. Like Soylent Green, Redfin is made of people\u2014sales staff and customer-service representatives.\n\nTo tech investors, companies that depend on such people are old-fashioned. People are unpredictable and hard to manage. They are costly to hire and train, and their path to success is difficult to set into an algorithm. People don't scale.\n\nYet Redfin is one of a handful of startups showing that people can make a big difference. Mr. Kelman believes that improving the real-estate business takes more than just better code. It takes better people, specifically, better real-estate agents. Consequently, Redfin has hired hundreds of agents on staff, people to whom it pays salaries, benefits and on whose work the company depends.\n\nAfter years of slow growth, Redfin is poised to hit it big. It's on track to book $100 million in revenue\u2014and turn a profit\u2014next year.\n\nAnd its path suggests that businesses that try to improve workers\u2014and not just code\u2014can be better for customers and, in the long run, better for the bottom line.\n\nLike Zillow Inc. and Trulia Inc., Redfin is partly a website that helps you find houses for sale. But unlike those companies, which make money through ads placed by traditional brokers, Redfin is a full-service brokerage. After you find your dream house on its site, Redfin makes money when you sign up with one of its agents to guide you through the home-buying process. (Its agents sell houses, too.)\n\nMr. Kelman says Redfin's unusual setup offers several advantages over traditional brokerages.\n\nFirst, it improves service. If you're touring a neighborhood and see a house for sale, you can order up a Redfin agent to drive over to show you the property quickly. In the company's most-established markets, Seattle, for instance, the agent can be at your service within an hour. (It takes longer in Redfin's newer markets, like Dallas). This works thanks to a blend of technology and management. Just as the Uber online ride service maps its drivers, Redfin keeps track of its agents' calendars and real-time locations. Unlike a traditional real-estate brokerage\u2014in which agents essentially are contractors of a brand, not employees\u2014Redfin's agents are salaried workers. The company can tell them where to go and what to do.\n\nRedfin helps soothe other home-buying frustrations as well. Redfin compiles detailed histories on competing brokerages' pricing strategies, strengthening Redfin agents' negotiating prowess. Redfin also conducts most of the home-buying process online, reducing paperwork. And if you're selling your house, Redfin can test offer prices on the Web, helping you to home in on the optimal price.\n\nThe biggest opportunity is price. Mr. Kelman says the incentives of traditional real-estate agents are misaligned with those of customers. If you're selling your house, your agent, who gets paid on commission, will prefer that you take a lowball offer over no offer. If you're buying, your agent will want you to bid higher than you might otherwise want\u2014or need\u2014to pay. Economists call this the Principal-Agent Problem, and it has proved stubbornly intractable in real estate.\n\nMr. Kelman says Redfin has a solution. About half a typical Redfin agent's pay comes through salary. The rest comes through commissions. But crucially, commissions are linked to detailed reviews that Redfin customers complete after sales. The reviews are posted online and affect each agent's future business. Your agent always has an incentive to please you. If pushing a client to close a deal will produce a bad review, the agent would rather not close.\n\nRedfin is still tiny. In its most-established locations, it has about 3% or 4% of the market. In bigger, newer markets, it seems nearly nonexistent.\n\nMr. Kelman concedes that his people-dependent model has slowed Redfin's growth. But he sees the prospect of long-term returns. \"After we hit a certain threshold in the market, our share begins to accelerate,\" he says. In other words, over time, better service begins to pay off.\n\nRedfin last month said it raised $50 million from T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Tiger Global Management LLC. Compared with tech-focused venture capitalists, Mr. Kelman says, these investors didn't care that Redfin might take several more years to realize its mission of revolutionizing real estate. They were willing to wait, he says.\n\n\"Most of Silicon Valley isn't that patient.\"\n\nWrite to Farhad Manjoo at farhad.manjoo@wsj.com",

Now, four years since its inception, Instagram has given birth to the first printed book of art photography. Out of the Phone is a new collection of exclusively mobile photography, all submitted on the site using the hashtag #outofthephone.\n\nPierre Legovic, who masterminded the project, says: \u201cI had this \u2018best of mobile\u2019 photobook idea for a while.

        "text": "How is your work at txteagle changing the world for the better through technology?\n\nMobile phone subscribers in emerging markets spend on average 10% of their annual income on mobile phone airtime. By providing people with free airtime in exchange for completing a survey or engaging with a brand, we're enabling people in emerging markets to keep the money they would have spent on airtime in their pocket.\n\nHow has the company developed and how big can it become?\n\nThrough partnerships with over 220 mobile phone carriers, txteagle has created a database of over 2.1 billion emerging-market consumers, whom it can reach using proprietary messaging protocols and a unique airtime compensation platform. As a result, txteagle provides global brands direct access to their next billion consumers. What do rural Chinese doctors think about fruit juice? Can Brazilian teenagers be incentivized to buy a specific brand of shoe with group coupons? Do local merchants in Bangalore have regular access to the internet?\n\nThis is such a massive opportunity because of global brands' passion to reach emerging-market consumers. Brands are currently spending $120 billion a year on advertising in emerging markets, and that number is projected to grow to $210 billion by 2015. But they're not spending it well. At the moment, they don't have the consumer data to do the kind of targeted advertising that has become mainstream in developed markets. They can't use coupons and other basic tools of engagement in emerging markets because there typically isn't technology at the point of sale. Txteagle's unique ability to identify, engage and incentivize billions of emerging-market consumers presents almost boundless potential interest on the part of hungry advertisers. And it creates an enormous opportunity for a serious portion of those dollars to go direct to those consumers, who, as I like to say, could effectively get a 5% \"raise.\"\n\nDoes txteagle have the power to influence the way we work in the developed world, as it is does in the developing world? In the developed world, we, too, spend quite a bit of our income on mobile phones! So the idea of airtime compensation has a lot of untapped potential, including in exchange for consumer opinions, brand engagement, etc. But the opportunity in emerging markets is so enormous that we're focused on that pretty exclusively for now.\n\nIs there untapped potential in mobile technology's ability to alleviate poverty?\n\nAbsolutely. The role of the mobile phone has been vastly under-appreciated in the context of economic development. People tend to focus on whether surfing the Web, making phone calls, and sending text messages and emails are potentially transformative activities. But mobile phones not only provide a mechanism for global communication, they also allow for global compensation.\n\nMobile phones can catapult empowerment in ways we haven't even begun to imagine. For now, the passion (and the dollars) are coming from global advertisers \u2013 which will enable us to prove the power of airtime compensation. But once unleashed, that's a tool with infinite possibility. Compensation via mobile phones will ultimately provide supplemental income to a significant fraction of the global population.\n\nWhat can other innovators learn from your experiences? What do you know now that you wish you knew five years ago?\n\nLessons learned through failure can often turn into a competitive advantage. Learn these lessons as often as you can stomach!\n\nMy main lesson has been around the patience to match innovation to the receptive environment. My original, and abiding, passion is around economic empowerment via airtime compensation. It took me some time to learn to phase that vision: prove it first in partnership with advertisers, and then tap its potential in the infinite other ways people earn compensation. But it's the right lesson. Innovation doesn't exist in a vacuum; it's about matching it to people's needs with just the right timing.\n\nWhere is txteagle headed, what are your long term aims?\n\nMy ultimate goal at txteagle is to re-route 30% of the money spent on mass advertising in the developing world to the individual consumers themselves\u2014 meanwhile helping brands build loyalty, and helping consumers get the goods and services they want. As I mentioned above, if we succeed, 1 billion people will effectively have a 5% raise \u2014 plus a better consumer marketplace to enrich their lives. txteagle is partnering with several of the world's largest global brands and advertising companies to make this vision real.\n\nFinally, what can we expect from you at the Guardian's Activate Summit?\n\nI'm delighted to have the opportunity to be on the closing keynote panel. I'll also be on the lookout for global brands who wish to cultivate consumer insights, engagement, and loyalty in emerging markets.",

        "text": "When Boston officials suddenly closed the dilapidated bridge from Quincy to Long Island in October, displacing hundreds of homeless people, the clock started ticking for Jack Connors.\n\nThe ad mogul-turned-philanthropist has overseen Camp Harbor View, a summer camp for urban kids on the island, for nearly eight years. But with the bridge gone, Connors\u2019 renowned money-raising and arm-twisting skills are being put to the test. The camp\u2019s foundation has to secure two ferry boats, rebuild a pier, and ensure that underwater lines for power and water make it to the island before 450 children arrive in July.\n\nIf Connors is nervous, he isn\u2019t showing it.\n\nA few weeks ago, Connors dug into his fat Rolodex and started calling on deep-pocketed donors who could help cover roughly a half-million dollars in new expenses incurred by the sudden need for water travel. By hitting up previous Camp Harbor View contributors as well as some new ones, Connors said, he hopes to plug the gap by April. He\u2019s bracing for the worst: It could take four years or more before a new bridge is built.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise an extra $500,000 [per summer] for all these extra costs, for as many years as it\u2019s going to take,\u201d Connors said. \u201cWe have some multiyear commitments [already]. A couple have said they\u2019ll keep doing it until the bridge is back.\u201d\n\nConnors\u2019s progress so far shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. After all, it was the Boston business community\u2019s generosity that built Camp Harbor View seven years ago. Then-Mayor Thomas M. Menino had reached out to Connors to address the violence plaguing some neighborhoods in Boston. Connors remembered seeing a field on Long Island when he visited as a child and proposed to Menino that the city-owned property with one-of-a-kind views be turned into a summer day camp.\n\nConnors manned the phones, and the dollars poured in. The Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston was tapped to run the camp and oversee its programs. Nearly $7 million paid for site work, fields, and construction of the camp\u2019s \u201cgreat hall\u201d for its first year, in 2007. (Connors, of course, was a key donor himself.) Another $11 million flowed during subsequent years for other capital projects, such as a 150-foot pier and a swimming pool.\n\nThen there\u2019s the camp\u2019s operating costs \u2014 last year, the budget was about $3 million \u2014 primarily funded through a gala that draws hundreds every June. Some of the city\u2019s top rainmakers, such people as Suffolk Construction\u2019s John Fish and Steward Health Care\u2019s Ralph de la Torre, have lined up to help sell tickets for the event. This year, EMC chief executive Joe Tucci joins Connors as cochairmen of the gala.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the camp is running low on cash. Connors built up a $6.3 million endowment over the years. About half of that came from Partners HealthCare, the giant hospital group where Connors served as board chairman. Connors said the endowment\u2019s purpose is to ensure the camp survives long after he\u2019s gone \u2014 not to navigate a short-term emergency.\n\nCara Gould, senior executive director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, said most of the 900 kids, ages 11 through 14, who get to attend the camp\u2019s four-week sessions each July and August spend the bulk of their young lives within a three-block radius of their homes. They live just miles away from the ocean, she said, but might never see the sun glint off the waves if not for Camp Harbor View.\n\nThe first day of camp in 2007.\n\n\u201cBringing them to this island, it\u2019s like bringing them to another world, even though it\u2019s 20 minutes away,\u201d Gould said.\n\nTo pull that off without a bridge, Connors and company need a boat \u2014 a really big boat. That\u2019s why the foundation reached an agreement last month with Bay State Cruise Co. to use its slow-speed Provincetown II ferry, at a cost of $200,000 for the season. There\u2019s more than enough room to make daily trips for the campers.\n\nBut one boat won\u2019t be enough. Connors needed another vessel for the kids who miss the morning boat and the catering crew that will cook the hot lunches. That\u2019s where the 60-person Miss Peddocks Island comes in. Connors said he is paying $120,000 for the season to two brothers for use of their vessel.\n\nSo far, so good. But the boats need a place to land. Connors wants to use the state-owned Squantum Point pier in Quincy, not far from where the Long Island bridge is located. Unfortunately for Connors, the pier was badly damaged in a nor\u2019easter in October. A spokesman for the Department of Conservation and Recreation said the state agency hopes to reopen the pier in time for summer.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of utilities. NStar expects to disconnect power to Long Island this month as part of the demolition project.The bridge also carries water and phone lines between Quincy and the island. Those will be gone, too. But city officials say they\u2019ve given a contractor a deadline of June 15 to install utility lines in the seabed.\n\nThe variables have prompted Connors and his team to have backup plans: installing on-site electricity generators, using the island\u2019s old water tower, boarding at the World Trade Center pier where the Provincetown II is normally docked. But these solutions could cost more in terms of time or money, in part for the extra barge trips.\n\nGould, the Boys and Girls Clubs executive, said she\u2019s not worried about the remaining logistical headaches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a long time ago,\u201d Gould said, \u201cthat with Jack Connors behind you, things happen.\u201d\n\nThe Camp Harbor View foundation, spearheaded by Jack Connors, has to secure an extra $500,000 to run two ferry boats, rebuild a pier, and ensure underwater lines for power and water make it to Long Island before 450 children arrive in July.",

        "text": "Sunday, the Boston Classical Orchestra, conducted by Steven Lipsitt, acknowledges a milestone \u2014 the group\u2019s 35th season \u2014 with a program including Joseph Haydn\u2019s Symphony No. 35. The symphony was written in 1767, the first full year Haydn (pictured) spent living at Esterh\u00e1za, the elaborate palace Haydn\u2019s patron and employer, Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy, built on the grounds of a hunting lodge near the Austro-Hungarian border. How elaborate? Work on Esterh\u00e1za would continue into the 1780s, at the eventual cost of some 13 million gulden. Converting Austro-Hungarian gulden is not the most straightforward task, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation, based on comparisons with average Viennese wages then and now, puts Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s cost, in modern dollars, well into the billions.\n\nThe dean of Haydn scholarship, H.C. Robbins Landon, plausibly speculated that the Symphony No. 35 was composed to welcome Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy home following a trip to Paris. That journey, too, involved Esterh\u00e1za: in search of new and interesting ways to spend lavishly on a residence, Nikolaus and his architect visited Versailles, another hunting lodge expanded into exceptional grandeur. However, the visit may have been somewhat anticlimactic, judging from the impressions of someone else who happened to be at Versailles in fall 1767: Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHaving been sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly (for a second time) to combat the Penn family\u2019s machinations, Franklin \u2014 accompanied by Sir John Pringle (future physician to George III) \u2014 made time for a French sojourn. Already renowned for his scientific achievements, Franklin was presented to the current monarch, Louis XV, whom Franklin described to his London friend Mary Stevenson as having \u201ca very lively look.\u201d Versailles itself, though, was less lively. The elaborate waterworks were \u201cout of Repair\u201d; elsewhere, Franklin saw \u201cshabby half Brick Walls and broken Windows.\u201d Versailles and Paris, Franklin concluded, were \u201ca prodigious Mixture of Magnificence and Negligence.\u201d\n\nThe dinginess failed to deter Nikolaus\u2019s ambition; Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s unrestrained splendor earned it the nickname of the \u201cHungarian Versailles.\u201d In the end, though, and like Versailles, Esterh\u00e1za became a museum. After Nikolaus\u2019s death in 1790, Anton Esterh\u00e1zy, his successor, decided that Esterh\u00e1za was too isolated for his taste. Anton\u2019s hobbies were more geological than musical; the extensive musical establishment Nikolaus had assembled was abruptly dismantled. It worked out well for Haydn, at least \u2014 freed from Esterh\u00e1za\u2019s continuous demands, the composer was f\u00eated in cities across Europe. Haydn, the palace-bound courtier, became Haydn, the musical citizen of the world.\n\nThe Boston Classical Orchestra, conducted by Steven Lipsitt, and featuring cellist Meehae Ryo and violinist In Mo Yang, performs music of Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart, Dec. 14 at 3 p.m. at Faneuil Hall (tickets $19-$74; 866-811-4111; www.bostonclassicalorchestra.org).",

        "text": "Lucian Freud was a fundamentalist in his belief that thoughts of the artist should never be allowed to interfere with their art. They should appear \"no more than God in nature\", he once wrote. So it was probably as well that he seldom gave interviews, because there was certainly a lot to talk about. Freud was famously gregarious, and loved the good life, including expensive food and cars. (His regular table at the Wolseley was said to be set with a black cloth last night.) And \"it is thought\", in the cautious words of this BBC profile, that he fathered \"dozens\" of children.\n\nThe legends about his ramshackle (some would say disgusting) studio were also true \u2013 as you can see from the dirt and paint that cakes the walls in this extract from Tim Meara's film Small Gestures in Bare Rooms. For a fuller profile, the best film available online is Jake Auerbach's Portraits (2004), made up of interviews with his friends and family. Part one includes, among other things, the memory of his friend, the novelist Francis Wyndham, being taken to the River Cafe in Freud's glamorous car. \"You know how frightening he can be as a driver,\" Wyndham says. In the second part, fellow artist David Hockney remembers sitting for Freud, and is full of praise for his work. \"I think they're as good portraits as have been done by anybody, actually,\" he says. The third part is here.\n\nAmong critics, the London Review of Books art writer Peter Campbell made a superbly detailed study of Freud's technique, following his visit to Tate Britain's 2002 retrospective. There is also this film on YouTube, which is far from slick \u2013 indeed it's annoyingly shoddy \u2013 but it does give a good summary of Freud's influences and development.\n\nThe Today programme this morning carried a clutch of interviews, including with Sue Tilley, the subject of several of Freud's portraits. Most notable among them was Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, which became the most expensive painting by a living artist ever sold when it was bought for \u00a317m in 2008, reportedly by Roman Abramovic at the instigation of his girlfriend, collector and millionairess Dasha Zhukova.\n\nTilley also spoke in more depth to BBC Breakfast this morning, revealing that the famously protracted process of sitting for Freud was not exaggerated \u2013 taking \"three days a week for nine months\" in her case. \"You'd think he was a very serious person,\" she adds, \"but his excitement when he met Kylie Minogue beggared belief.\"\n\nPerhaps his closest literary counterpart, when it came to documenting the grotesque glory of the human body, was John Updike. And maybe it's a fitting way to say goodbye to one of the greatest British painters ever to read this short poem, in which the writer pays tribute to Freud's work.",

        "text": "About 15 years ago I did a drawing titled\n\nbased on studies of how London could grow as a polycentric metropolis with higher degrees of connectivity. This research clarified to me how London could expand eastwards \u2013 more or less what is happening now with the Olympic Games as the catalyst.It is very interesting to see it becoming a reality. I think one of the great challenges is the fundamental restructuring away from the \"Fordist\" paradigm of an industrial mass society towards a society with much greater degrees of complexity and dynamism in people's lives. So hybrid mixed-used buildings have become very interesting. There also needs to be a further shift away from zoning \u2013 you live here, work there and play somewhere else. By layering all these uses together, in the same zone, it completely changes the way we look at cities.\n\nIn 1989 there was no city government planning anything, it was all pretty haphazard. Broadly, No one in 1989 realised the long-term impact of deregulation was going to be so dramatic for the financial sector. There was an assumption of slow decline. Now, we've got the London Plan, which I devised and which came into force in February 2004, which is a strategy through to 2025. Given the length of time it takes to get things done, the only big question mark now is the transport projects like Crossrail \u2013 they depend on the outcome of the next general election: whether you get a government who's prepared to back that sort of investment. London might not grow as well as it should, it might not be as environmental a city as it should be, but I don't think anyone's going to see London as a failure.\n\nThere will be serious talk of bringing back a riverbus service for the Thames. There will be more white ghost-bicycles than any other kind, cycling being compulsory for those who want access to the National Health Service . Privileged lanes for VIP non-participants will have expanded and public lanes shrunk. Tickets will be at a premium for permanent show trials, inquiries into inquiries, after terrorist outrages and botched judicial executions. Film, television and other forms of electronic communication will happen on fingernail-size screens and be without content, other than re-runs of\n\n. Locality won't exist, the slab or vertical stack being the universal form. West Ham FC will debate a move into the part-demolished Olympic stadium. The late Ken Livingstone, in computer-generated form, fresh from his triumph in\n\n, will be re-elected as mayor.\n\nThe key thing is that the population of London will have risen to around 9m which is well above its previous highest level, and there will be an even bigger concentration of economic activity than now. London's capacity to attract people from all over the world \u2013 rich Americans and Europeans to asylum seekers \u2013 will continue. So by 2030 London will be a city that is over 40% overseas-born, even higher than it is now. There will be a similar percentage for the non-white population, so it will be even more cosmopolitan than it is today. In a curious way this cosmpolitan-ness and the tolerance that goes with it becomes a self-reinforcing factor, so it becomes even more attractive to people who are footloose, international and often talented. The skyline will probably have even more towers on it, it will probably be a city which has had to tackle congestion more comprehensively by then. What there will certainly be is a greater number of electric vehicles: by then small, silent electric vehicles will be much greater in number and there will be many fewer noisy, dirty, big vehicles of the kind we accept as normal today. we'll look back on the streets today and wonder how it was possible to tolerate the diesel-driven big vehicles: there'll be pressure to improve the air and environment, that's for sure. There's no evidence thus far of any society getting away from railways, especially when they're all built. The one thing I don't think there will be a move away from is working in city centres, or in the centre of London, but for many years there have been prophets who think that eventually people because of electronic communication will be able to work from home and visit the city centre occasionally; I think that analysis is wrong: partly because many people want to go to work, they enjoy the social element. Outer London, the bit that most people live in but people outside London don't know so well, will benefit: partly as a result of the population growth but also due to the Olympic development in the east. I think the big question is what happens to other parts of London, particularly south London where economic prospects have always been more challenged.\n\nFashion shows becoming live will be increasingly popular - that's going to take off and in twenty year's time should be well-established. It's allowing two things: first it allows the consumer to see it as soon as it hits the catwalk, and then through sites like netaporter.com you can buy the clothes before they get to the shops, so that's changing the whole way people consume fashion and the way they see it. We're seeing the embryonic form of a new medium happening now. People are living their lives through their mobile phones and laptops. In terms of what people will be wearing it depends on which society-changing events you get between now and then. Any form of civil unrest on a large scale or wars, influence fashion. You really have to start looking at politics: what clothes people wear is dependent on what their role in society is. Fashion is unpredictable, as events are. I'd like to see the parameters of what we consider beauty completely enlarged: we're really only presented with one version of how women should look at the moment and that's really quite shocking. I hope that we'll no longer tolerate being shown images of ourselves in such narrow parameters.\n\nFood growing in the city will be commonplace: oil shocks and a growing awareness of food security will have encouraged people to grow their own. Rooftops and spare places will be full of vegetables: not, obviously, enough to feed the city but enough to reconnect people to food and make them more resilient and more aware of where food comes from. A much higher percentage of our food will come from farms around London with a lessening of dependency on foreign imports. Oil prices and water shortages will make this essential. We will have electric chargers across the city and electric vehicles will be commonplace. Biking will have increased dramatically \u2013 and proper bike super-highways will allow Londoners to commute across the city. Food co-ops will be common and waste will be used for power and not go to landfill. Recycling will be second nature and all homes will have smart meters, both for electricity and water usage. It won't be an age of austerity but it will be an age of watchfulness.",

And while the stock has been stalled recently, Cramer thinks that the company is moving in the right direction.\n\nCisco reported a 3-cent earnings beat from a 56-cent basis, with higher-than-expected revenues and strong guidance for the next quarter. The company continues to move into high-growth areas such as cybersecurity and the Internet of things, while removing itself from low-margin businesses such as their set-top-box division, which it sold for about $600 million in July.\n\nTo find out what could be in the pipeline for Cisco, Cramer spoke with Robbins.\n\nThe new CEO stated that he sees a strong future ahead in the area of cybersecurity, an area that Cramer considers to be the fastest growing group of any business on Earth.

After it peaked at $25 in April, it was slammed down to $14 on Wednesday.\n\nThe company reported its quarterly results on Tuesday, and investors took the stock to the woodshed on the assumption that it was disappointing.

To find out more, Cramer spoke with CEO Richard Thompson.

Grenada had been troubling the Reagan administration ever since its Constitution was suspended after a coup in 1979, and the new government began to cozy up to Communist Cuba.\n\nThe American invasion of Grenada was very unpopular in Britain, as Grenada was a Commonwealth nation.\n\n\u201cIf I were there Margaret, I\u2019d throw my hat in the door before I came in,\u201d Reagan said, which the BBC recalled was an old tradition that allowed an unwelcome guest to announce their arrival before they entered a room. The full transcript of the phone conversation is available on the Margaret Thatcher Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nWhile Thatcher wasn\u2019t exactly forgiving, she did say she understood where Reagan was coming from. \u201cI know about sensitivity, because of the Falklands. That\u2019s why I would not speak for very long even on the secret telephone to you. Because even that can be broken. I\u2019m very much aware of sensitivities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe action is underway now and we just hope it will be successful.\u201d\n\nThe conversation ended on good terms, though, with Thatcher getting off the phone to go to a \u201ctricky\u201d Parliament debate, and Reagan encouraging her to \u201cGo get \u2019em.

        "text": "About three years ago, Adobe research scientist Hailin Jin saw a need for a new technology that would make it easy for graphic designers to identify, compare, and choose typefaces. So he created the prototype of a product he dubbed DeepFont. The idea was to replace the often tedious and time-consuming old methods of selecting typefaces with a far quicker and more accurate point-and-click app.\n\nJust one small problem: It didn\u2019t work. \u201cThe different machine-learning algorithms we used weren\u2019t accurate enough,\u201d Jin says now. DeepFont was only accurate about 50% of the time, and customers expected at least 90%, he says. So Jin and his team went back to the drawing board, trying different technologies that eventually increased the tool\u2019s speed and accuracy. \u201cWe\u2019re over 90% now,\u201d says Jin. \u201c[And] customers like it.\u201d\n\nAt some companies, DeepFont\u2019s initial failure would have relegated it to the dumpster and damaged Jin\u2019s career. Adobe adbe , however, takes a different approach. \u201cIt\u2019s actually ideal when someone\u2019s first attempt at a new product or feature is a failure,\u201d says Mark Randall, the company\u2019s vice president of innovation. \u201cIt teaches people how to respond to what customers need or want\u2014which is often not what you\u2019d expect they want.\u201d\n\nRandall began building what he calls \u201ca whole culture of experimenting\u201d in 2013, when he started giving employees something he invented called Kickbox. An innovation toolkit that walks users through a six-step process of turning an idea into a marketable product, Kickbox is available to anyone who wants to download it, and Randall says hundreds of companies, government agencies, and nonprofits have done so. \u201cIt\u2019s completely free and open-source,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe don\u2019t even ask for your email address.\u201d\n\nOnly about 10% of Adobe\u2019s 14,000 own employees worldwide have used Kickbox and attended workshops on it. \u201cBut 10% is a kind of magical number, because once you get there, everyone in the company knows someone who is trying to innovate,\u201d says Randall. \u201cEven people whose jobs don\u2019t require innovation are exposed to it in some way. It creates a powerful shift in the culture.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, says Jin, who has been at Adobe for 12 years, getting approval for a new product is much faster now. \u201cBefore, you had to get buy-in from your own boss, the product team, and other departments,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, people work on projects without anyone\u2019s approval.\u201d Jin adds that, before Kickbox, \u201crisk taking was allowed. Now, it\u2019s rewarded. That has really changed the way people think.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason why, Randall observes, Adobe\u2019s approach is tough for most companies to embrace. He spends a lot of time talking to managers from elsewhere who want to encourage new ideas, but, he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really work to ask employees to take a risk on something new if the company isn\u2019t risking something, too.\u201d Noting that each Kickbox kit at Adobe contains $1,000 of the company\u2019s money\u2014not to mention the cost of the time employees spend working on projects that may or may not pan out\u2014Randall points out, \u201cWe fund each new idea before we know what it is.\u201d\n\nOther employers struggle with that, he says, and the bigger the organization, the more difficult it is, because trusting people subverts all the control mechanisms. \u201cMany people from big companies have asked me, \u2018Isn\u2019t there some way to let people [use Kickbox] without any risk to the company?\u2019\u201d Randall says. \u201cThe answer is \u2018no\u2019\u2014and in fact, ideally, you want to highlight that element of risk. Make sure everyone knows about it. Let employees know that you\u2019re betting on them to come up with great ideas.\u201d\n\nSo far, that bet seems to be paying off. Thanks partly to a crop of employee inventions that have proven popular with customers, Adobe reported record revenues of $1.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, up 25% from the same period in 2015, and a 48% jump in profits.",

But he has found his voice again since learning that Bernie Sanders is interested in his plight.\n\n\u201cI am a big-time Sanders fan and I hope he can help us,\u201d said the 37-year-old assembly specialist. \u201cBut even if he can\u2019t, maybe we can stop this happening to other American workers.\u201d\n\nThe Feb. 9 announcement by United Technologies Corp\u2019s Carrier unit that it would shift production to Mexico from Indianapolis has thrust the long-term trend of U.S. manufacturing job decline to the foreground of the nation\u2019s election year agenda.\n\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump seized on the announcement to amplify his position that companies such as Carrier should be taxed if they send jobs to low wage countries.\n\nDemocratic candidate Sanders called Carrier, a maker of air conditioners, an \u201cexample of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers.\u201d The 2016 U.S. presidential election is in November.\n\nCommunities around Indianapolis have witnessed a steady outflow of factory jobs over the past two decades. What made this action different was a YouTube video of the workers getting the news that by Thursday afternoon had more than 3.4 million views, and the political reaction to it.\n\n\u201cI came here 30 years ago looking for the American dream,\u201d said Hatice Lancaster, 51, originally from Turkey. \u201cMaybe I should have gone to Mexico instead.\u201d\n\nChuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents the Carrier workers, said he hopes to use the attention to force Carrier to reverse its decision.\n\nJones faces a steep climb. Carrier has told the union it can pay Mexican workers $3 an hour versus more than $20 on average in Indianapolis. A spokeswoman for Carrier said the company pays a \u201ccompetitive wage\u201d based on local conditions and could not discuss pay levels.\n\nSince 1998, the chain-smoking, plain-spoken and profane Jones has watched the number of factories represented by his local dwindle to 12 from 38. He and his staff can rattle off the names of plants that have closed.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.\u201d\n\nJones is now giving interviews to anyone who asks \u2013 he was interrupted by multiple phone calls seeking comment while talking to Reuters \u2013 in the hope \u201cthis time America will pay attention and do something about rampant corporate greed.\u201d\n\nJones is grateful that Trump has drawn public attention to Carrier, but he sees Sanders \u201cas a champion for our cause.\u201d Jones said he has been contacted by the Sanders campaign. A member of the Sanders campaign said the Vermont senator\u2019s team would be in touch with Jones.\n\nSome Carrier workers interviewed outside the plant said they are drawn to Trump.\n\nBrian Easton, 45, said he and his wife work for Carrier, and are now coming to terms with what he said is likely to be a permanent drop in their living standard.\n\n\u201cThis country is run by Corporate America and we need someone in office like Donald Trump who is not beholden to anyone,\u201d Easton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can save our jobs, but if we draw attention to this perhaps other workers won\u2019t have to go through this.\u201d",

        "text": "Ever since the European Union\u2019s top court ruled in May that individuals have a \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d Google has been working to abide by the new rules. The company has received over 70,000 takedown requests from individuals who want 250,000 webpages removed from Google\u2019s search results. Google\u2019s team individually reviews each application, and the company plans to hire more employees to handle the extra workload. Changing the way people think about the Internet is an overwhelming task.\n\nBut Google is not the only company scrambling in the wake of the E.U.\u2019s decision. As Internet users begin requesting that unsavory parts of their pasts or personal contact information be erased from Google\u2019s search results, so-called reputation management companies are seeing a flood of new business. Traditionally confined to creating new web content about their clients\u2014laudatory blog posts, celebratory articles, swooning social media updates\u2014these companies are now trying to help their clients erase content as well. \u201cOnline image management has long been in the business of producing new content so you have a better persona online,\u201d says Cayce Myers, a professor at Virginia Tech and legal research editor for the Institute for Public Relations. \u201cHere they\u2019re doing the reverse.\u201d\n\nOnline reputation management is a growing business that is now being boosted by the E.U. ruling. For a fee that can amount to thousands of dollars a month, companies take on clients and scrub clean their search results by creating search engine-optimized content that hog up the first few pages of search results on Google. Clients ranging from CEOs, major corporations, celebrities down to doctors and restaurateurs who use the services to whitewash their online presence. Media consultant BIA/Kelsey forecasts that small and medium-size businesses will spend $3.5 billion managing their online reputations in 2014.\n\nNow, the E.U.\u2019s court ruling has changed the dynamics of the industry, expanding these businesses\u2019 client base and making it easier for them to delete content rather than just create it. \u201cThe number of our inbound leads\u201d\u2014new referrals\u2014\u201chas gone up about 50 percent since the beginning of May,\u201d says Simon Wadsworth, managing director of the U.K.-based online reputation management firm Igniyte. The E.U. ruling \u201chas raised awareness of the industry. You can change how you do things online.\u201d\n\nBertrand Girin, the founder of a France-based reputation management company, Reputation VIP, has created a spin-off service that specifically to designed to help people make \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests to Google. Aptly named Forget.Me, it lets users choose from one of 40 boilerplate requests in nine separate categories in order to send Google a pre-formulated request. The service, which is free, allows users to bypass some of the thorny legal questions and the difficulty of properly structuring a request. \u201cWhen Google put its form online, we looked at the demand from the public and we saw a gap,\u201d says Girin. \u201cWe said, \u2018let\u2019s help people understand what their problem is.\u2019\u201d\n\nForget.me has 17,000 registered users who have submitted over 2,500 applications to Google. The boilerplate response responses, which were written by lawyers, can be modified by users to address more specific claims. Girin is promoting the service as one that makes it easy for regular people to be forgotten on the internet. Dealing with Google is a \u201cbureaucratic hassle,\u201d says Myers, the legal research editor for the Institute for Public Relations.\u201dYou can technically do it yourself for free, but navigating the bureaucracy is in a state of flux.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see where it could be cumbersome,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe buzz around right to be forgotten has given these companies much-wanted attention. Andy Donaldson, the CEO of the reputation management company Hit Search, has invested heavily in building and marketing a search software that allowed users to monitor their own online personas over multiple platforms. But Donaldson said that since the E.U. ruling, the number of his company\u2019s new client leads has increased by \u201cupwards of three or four hundred.\u201d \u201cWe invested in post-graduate doctors in computer science and mathematics to help us build our algorithm,\u201d Donaldson said, \u201cBut it ends up being something like this that triggers the market that\u2019s really totally out of our control.\u201d\n\nDonaldson gave an example of how the E.U. ruling has been a boon for business. (He couldn\u2019t disclose the names of his clients.) The CEO of a large U.K.-based company was involved in a dispute during a friendly rugby match with a well-known journalist. The journalist wrote a damning story about the incident, blaming the CEO. The CEO\u2019s wife, having just read about the E.U. ruling, sought out Hit Search to get the story removed from Google\u2019s search results. The request is unlikely to be successful\u2014Google is reticent about removing news stories on public persons\u2014but Donaldson won a client lead.\n\nGoogle has taken a hard-nosed stance toward many of the requests reputation management firms have made, with the overwhelming number of takedown requests coming back with refusals. Donaldson said he has sent hundreds of requests for his clients to Google; of the requests Google has responded to, under ten percent have been accepted, he says. That\u2019s because Google isn\u2019t likely to take down a search result like a newspaper story about a public figure, for instance, or a negative review about a roofing company.\n\n\u201cPeople think we\u2019ve got some magic button in Google and we press delete,\u201d says Wadsworth, the CEO of Igniyte. His clients often ask for links to be removed that won\u2019t pass Google\u2019s bar. \u201cWe\u2019re telling the majority of people, \u2018you\u2019ve got no chance,\u2019\u201d Wadsworth says.\n\nTheir success rates aside, the right to be forgotten ruling is going to drive business growth for some time to come. \u201cThis is a first step into a general public market. It\u2019s a big market,\u201d said Girin. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real demand here.\u201d",

        "text": "Gordon Parks is one of America\u2019s most celebrated photographers. He is also one of the most misunderstood. Museums and galleries around the world have celebrated him as the creator of some of the 20th century\u2019s most iconic images. Yet to appreciate only his achievements as an artist is to underestimate his importance as a documentary photographer and journalist. The photo essays Parks produced, primarily for LIFE magazine from the 1940s to the 1970s, on issues relating to poverty and social justice, established him as one of the era\u2019s most significant interpreters of American society. His peers were writers like Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin as much as they were LIFE photographers like Margaret Bourke-White and W. Eugene Smith. Visual Justice: The Gordon Parks Photography Collection at Wichita State University, an exhibition at the Ulrich Museum of Art (for which I served as senior project advisor), examines photographs from six of his most powerful photo essays, enriching our understanding of his work in its historical context.\n\nIn interviews and in his memoirs, Parks, who passed away in 2006, always emphasized that there was \u201cno special black man\u2019s corner\u201d for him at LIFE. He was as comfortable photographing celebrities, Paris fashions and Benedictine monks as he was an impoverished family in Harlem and Black Panther Party members in Oakland. Photographs which are far removed from pressing social concerns make up part of Visual Justice. Yet, as its title suggests, the photo essays that grapple with social justice are at the heart of the exhibition.\n\n\u201cHarlem Gang Leader,\u201d from 1948, was Parks\u2019 second major assignment for LIFE. Parks spent a month with 17-year-old Red Jackson, the teenaged gang leader of the story\u2019s title, and other members of the Midtowners gang. His goal, he once said, was to show that juvenile delinquents were teenagers whose lives could be turned around if the right social service agencies intervened. As Russell Lord, a curator at the New Orleans Museum of Art, has shown, Parks discovered that when he turned in his film to LIFE\u2019s laboratories, he ceded control of his story to the magazine\u2019s editors. While the tone of the published photo essay was generally sympathetic to Jackson and the other gang members, it emphasized violence and slighted the potential for rehabilitation. Parks learned his lesson. His eagerness to write the text that accompanied his future photographs reflected his desire to assert more control over their message.\n\nParks was one of LIFE\u2019s best known and most admired photographers by the time that \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Day Is Almost Over,\u201d his photo essay about the Black Muslims, appeared in 1963. His star status allowed him to exert more control over his story than he had over previous stories. The result was a nuanced and finely textured photo essay that challenged conventional wisdom about the group. Visual Justice contains 30 of the photographs that Parks made, most never before published or exhibited, during the three months he worked on the assignment, traveling from New York to Los Angeles, with stops in Chicago and Phoenix. They portray a religious community that is far different from the dangerous collection of fanatics that television and the press usually depicted. They emphasize the importance of family, faith and disciplined, peaceful protest. Many of the images show Malcolm X, who was Parks\u2019 guide through the world of the Black Muslims, in a variety of roles\u2014spokesman, prayer leader, amateur photographer.\n\nIn 1968, Parks\u2019 editors challenged him to show them (and LIFE\u2019s readers) the roots of the anger and frustration that were then so evident in the African American community. In \u201cA Harlem Family,\u201d his subjects were the Fontenelles, a family whose lives were battered by menial jobs, poor schools and wretched living conditions. Their plight tortured Parks, who often found himself buying food for them. Darkness and despair pervade the photographs. Plaster peels from the walls of the family\u2019s apartment; children huddle under blankets for daytime warmth; the father stares blankly into a void.\n\nIn the pages of LIFE, \u201cA Harlem Family\u201d began not with a photograph, but with a prose-poem by Parks. Speaking in the voice of black America, he asked his readers, whom he understood to be white, to \u201cLook at me. Listen to me. Try to understand my struggle against your racism.\u201d Parks hoped to provoke a response, and he got it. Hundreds of letters, now preserved in the Gordon Parks Papers at Wichita State University, poured into the magazine\u2019s offices. Some were hostile, blaming the Fontenelles for their own misery. Many were sympathetic, however, expressing concern and asking how to help the family. Readers sent money. Their contributions were enough, in fact, that when LIFE topped them off, the Fontenelles were able to move out of Harlem and into a new apartment in Queens. But tragedy followed them. In the spring of 1969, LIFE reported that a fire had broken out in the family\u2019s new home and that the father, Norman, and a son, Kenneth, had died. In his memoirs, Parks described the overwhelming guilt he felt for their fate. He stayed in touch with them until the end of his life, offering them a hand whenever they needed it.\n\nParks was a man of many pursuits\u2014photographer, novelist, poet, memoirist, filmmaker, composer. But he is most remembered as a photographer. And while some of his images live on because they delight the eye with their beauty, others endure because of the way that they touched the hearts and minds of millions of LIFE\u2019s readers and changed, if only just a little, the course of American history.",

Both wireless carriers and Internet companies alike are making big bets that you will soon, generating more traffic and revenue in the process.\n\nBut most Web sites aren\u2019t ready to receive mobile visitors: Complex designs and intense graphics often turn conventional Web pages into gibberish on phones or other mobile devices.\n\nNow, an upstart group hopes to change that by promoting a new Web address and set of design standards it says will make the Internet more accessible for users with tiny, portable screens.\n\nIn May, Dublin-based Mobile Top Level Domain will start taking registrations for \u201c.mobi\u201d Internet addresses, joining the familiar .com, .net and international domains such as Japan\u2019s .jp and the European Union\u2019s .eu suffix. Registrants that want to use .mobi addresses will have to overhaul their sites to make sure they work as well on a cell-phone screen as PC. If they don\u2019t, their address\u2013and their business\u2013will be put on hold.\n\nLed by General Manager Neil Edwards, the group hopes to tap into a growing U.S. mobile data marketplace that reached $8.3 billion last year, according to the Yankee Group. Edwards, who spent six years as vice president at VeriSign\u2018s Network Solutions group, says the new domain\u2019s accessibility standards could help spark more mobile Web traffic.\n\n\u201cTaking the Internet as we know it with content built for a PC with broadband and a .com address just doesn\u2019t work for mobile phones,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople are going to trust .mobi because they know it works and it works fast and cost-effectively.\u201d\n\nMobile phones have tiny screens that make Web browsing difficult, but that\u2019s not their only limitation. The devices usually have cruder browsers than their PC counterparts and can have trouble with large graphics and embedded multimedia. Streamlined .mobi sites are supposed to make the Web pages easier and faster to load.\n\nWeb sites don\u2019t have to use a .mobi address to accommodate wireless users. Many of the Internet\u2019s most popular Web sites, such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com , already have slimmed-down versions for cell-phone browsers.\n\nIn many cases, users need to find the mobile edition manually, but some companies have also set up redirection commands that automatically send phone surfers to the lo-fi version. Still, actual mileage may vary: In an informal test, Time Warner\u2018s AOL.com seamlessly redirected a user with a two-year-old Sony Ericsson T610 on T-Mobile\u2019s network to its mobile site, but balked when approached by a higher-tech Dell Axim X30 mobile device. An AOL rep says that mobile users should head directly to mobile.aol.com to avoid any issues.\n\nEarly .mobi backers include Web content giants such as Google , which already has its google.mobi site up and running, and Microsoft , whose Windows Mobile operating system powers many of the newest smartphones and palmtops in the U.S. Other .mobi sponsors include device mobile manufacturers Nokia and Samsung and mobile carriers such as Deutsche Telekom\u2018s T-Mobile, Telecom Italia Mobile and Vodafone , which, along with Verizon Communications , owns Verizon Wireless in the U.S.\n\nWill .mobi catch on? Most Web users still associate Internet browsing with .com addresses, with good reason: According to VeriSign, almost half of the 85.6 million domain names registered worldwide in late 2005 were .com addresses.\n\n\u201cThere is a definite and strongly held perception out there that you have to have .com to do business online,\u201d says David Melancon, North America president of FutureBrand, a New York-based branding firm.\n\nBut Melancon says as it becomes harder to get elite .com addresses, that perception will have to change. While he isn\u2019t sold on .mobi, he says a company\u2019s Internet address will become a less important part of their brand in the future.\n\n\u201cWe got used to dialing ten phone digits instead of seven, and we will easily get used to this as well,\u201d he says. \u201cWith more and more addresses, \u2018something-dot-com\u2019 as a brand is going to start to lose power.\u201d\n\nComments are turned off for this post.",

And that's not how people are feeling these days.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that legislative disagreements shouldn't fuel rifts, urging unity despite policy differences on gun control.\n\n\"Sometimes we disagree passionately on how to get there -- but in having this debate, let's not lose sight of the values that unite us,\" Ryan said. \"Let's not lose sight in our common humanity.\"\n\n\"If we lose those fundamental things, what's left?\" he added. \"We need to take a moment here for reflection, for thought, for prayer, for justice, for action. Right now, let's let justice be done. And also let some healing occur too.\"\n\nRyan's comments come after a weeks-long partisan standoff in Congress over gun control legislation. Democrats renewed their call for legislative action after the mass slaying of dozens at a gay nightclub in Orlando last month.\n\nThough Ryan planned to hold a House vote earlier this week on gun control measures that would have restricted purchases by suspected terrorists, the House speaker backed away from scheduling it this week.\n\nHe said Wednesday that the House would vote on it \"when we're ready,\" adding that \"we have members from both sides of the aisle who want to make improvements, who want to make changes to the bill.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, followed Ryan on the House floor, thanking the families of those police officers that gave their lives Thursday night.\n\n\"We pray that it is a comfort to you that so many people mourn your loss and are praying for you at this sad time,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe California Democrat also called for \"mercy\" in the wake of the recent shootings, adding to Ryan's call for justice.\n\n\"I associate myself with the remark of our Speaker when he referenced our president. 'Justice will be done. Justice must be done,'\" Pelosi said. \"We must also [have] mercy. Mercy must be done.\"\n\n\"We have to get to the facts and to the root causes of what caused these tragedies,\" she continued. \"We must continue the work of nonviolence and demand an end to senseless killing everywhere.\"",

        "text": "He led millions of voters to feel the Bern. On Monday night in Philadelphia, the Democratic Party needed Bernie Sanders to keep the blaze under control.\n\nBy the end of the night \u2014 well, the house was still standing. But it was a journey to get there, and the acrimony played out on television before the convention even started.\n\nDays ago, you might have guessed this convention would be smooth \u2014 or boring \u2014 compared with the raucous smack-down festival that emerged in Cleveland from Donald J. Trump\u2019s smoke machine.\n\nThat changed with the release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, which showed members of the committee plainly taking sides with Hillary Clinton and against Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, during the campaign.\n\nCarefully bandaged wounds were ripped open, delegates were in open revolt and one of the first targets of hostility from Sanders backers was Senator Sanders himself. When he reiterated his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton to the delegates early Monday afternoon, the room erupted, and to paraphrase \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d they were not shouting \u201cFeel the boo-erns.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who may have felt smug when Republicans booed Senator Ted Cruz during prime time for not endorsing the party\u2019s nominee were now worried their runner-up would be booed in prime time for endorsing.\n\nIt was real-time couples\u2019 counseling in public. The Democrats scrubbed the departing committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, from the program, yet delegates booed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name and chanted \u201cBernie! Bernie!\u201d during the opening invocation prayer. Would the room explode every time someone named the nominee for four days? It was devolving into a total shout show.\n\nThe room cooled a bit as the cable networks went into prime time, and the first hour focused on emotional, personal stories from nonpoliticians, pointedly including undocumented immigrants, mostly cast at the Republican convention as murderous invaders.\n\nBut there was still an unsettled tone \u2014 outbursts and competing chants in the hall, the sense that one wrong word could set everything off.\n\nThe comedian Sarah Silverman, who supported Senator Sanders in the primaries, spoke with Senator Al Franken of Minnesota (formerly a comic himself) and united the crowd against Mr. Trump, whose behavior Ms. Silverman described as \u201cI\u2019m still emotionally 4 and calling people names from my gold-encrusted sandbox.\u201d\n\nBut as Mr. Franken and Ms. Silverman were asked to vamp for time before the next act, Paul Simon, the crowd turned restive. The duo tried to counter more \u201cBernie\u201d chanting (Mr. Franken went with \u201cHillary,\u201d Ms. Silverman with \u201cunity\u201d; neither worked). Then Ms. Silverman went into dealing-with-hecklers mode. \u201cCan I just say to the \u2018Bernie-or- bust\u2019 people,\u201d she said, pausing to shoot a look, \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d\n\nFinally, Mr. Simon sang \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water.\u201d Maybe \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d would have seemed like wishful thinking.\n\nBut Mr. Simon\u2019s lullaby felt like more than crowd control. The protests were noisy, but the first night\u2019s planned program had a distinctly different tone from the Republican convention, which exhorted the faithful to embrace their anger. (\u201cGuilty!\u201d \u201cLock her up!\u201d) It was going after different emotions and using different rhetoric: tear-jerking rather than raging grief, mockery rather than prosecution.\n\nThe tone seemed to be part of a larger argument, a kind of recasting of Republican attacks against political correctness. In Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview and his convention\u2019s, mealy-mouthed P.C. Democrats refused to call things the way they saw them and name dangers for what they are.\n\nThe Democrats argued back that the way you say things is a mark of character. Footage of Mr. Trump mocking a disabled reporter played over and over. Speakers repeatedly called out Mr. Trump\u2019s insult-comic campaign, calling him a bad role model for children. \u201cYou can\u2019t love your country,\u201d said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, \u201cwithout loving your countrymen and countrywomen.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama, the first of three headline speakers, was emotional, valedictory and hopeful as she described watching her daughters \u2014 \u201ctwo beautiful, intelligent black young women\u201d \u2014 playing with their dogs on the lawn of the White House, which was built by slaves. She rebutted Mr. Trump without using his name, playing against his slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d: \u201cThis, right now, is the greatest country on earth.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the Democratic National Convention, the comedian Sarah Silverman told delegates continuing to back Bernie Sanders that they were \u201cbeing ridiculous.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to delight Bill Clinton, the former president and political maven, whom the CNN camera presented in split-screen as a human, partisan applause-o-meter through the night. At times he seemed to zone out, but when he\u2019s engaged, Mr. Clinton consumes a speech the way Guy Fieri does a sandwich.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts served the red meat, in a scathing keynote that redeployed many attacks she\u2019s goaded Mr. Trump with on the campaign trail. Still, you could hear Bernistas chanting \u201cWe trusted you!\u201d\n\nIt was time for Senator Sanders to enter the lion\u2019s den he helped build.\n\nHe has been one of the memorable figures of 2016, but you would not describe him as a calming one. Compared with past movement leaders \u2014 Barack Obama, say \u2014 he\u2019s a forceful rather than lyrical speaker, his voice a Brooklyn-style poke in the chest, his music power chords rather than soaring arpeggios.\n\nBut in the moment, that was what brought the room together: a pugilistic, greatest-hits speech that framed his near-win as a historic and practical victory for the left. He collected protracted cheers and led his followers through catharsis \u2014 there were a lot of tear-stained faces on camera \u2014 to, if not acceptance, some later stage of grief. He declared that \u201cHillary Clinton will make an outstanding president\u201d and lived to tell the tale.\n\nMrs. Clinton herself was an offstage presence, unlike Mr. Trump, who made a the-mothership-has-landed appearance the first night of his convention. She was talked about (adjectives like \u201ctenacious\u201d were popular) and seen on video. She\u2019ll have to get onstage eventually, and that will test how much healing Monday\u2019s talk therapy really achieved.\n\nBut by the end of prime time, the Democrats looked and sounded happier than they did that afternoon, their discord, if not totally assuaged, at least politically corrected.",

Namely because there is as much professional as personal in this situation, and that\u2019s my job (some may disagree, and that\u2019s understandable).\n\nMultiple sources now say that CCMP was tipped off in mid-December that Murray might have a serious substance abuse problem. It was not something that any of his partners had previously suspected, but a subsequent investigation led the firm, in January, to place Murray on a 60-day medical leave of absence. In written correspondence with limited partners, CCMP used the same \u201chealth-related\u201d terminology that it would use in February after determining that the separation with Murray needed to be made permanent.\n\nIt appears that CCMP was more forthcoming in response to verbal queries from certain LPs \u2014 including members of its LP advisory committee \u2014 but never in writing (likely for legal reasons).\n\nFor CCMP, this situation is about more than personal tragedy and professional embarrassment.

A rolling reinstatement process is now underway. I would imagine that it will pass (i.e., the firm will get to keep investing) \u2014 particularly given that the fund is already around 40% committed, and LPs committed to the broader team within the past year \u2014 but not all the votes are in yet.\n\nCCMP declined to comment for this story.",

I\u2019m 8 years old, and I\u2019m going to sing \u2018Anaconda\u2019 by Nicki Minaj.\u201d\n\nThat does not happen at a Kidz Bop Kids show, of course, but you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting such a jaw-dropping scenario. The Kidz Bop Kids are the public face and live-tour extension of Kidz Bop, the wildly successful album series on which youngsters sing today\u2019s top hits, often with family-friendly changes to the lyrics.\n\nThe company\u2019s tagline, \u201csung by kids for kids,\u201d is such a no-brainer. But it didn\u2019t take flight until Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam, cofounders of the label Razor & Tie, developed the idea in late 2000. The first volume of Kidz Bop, released the next year, was an immediate and massive success.\n\nSo much so that 14 years on, there are 28 volumes, most of which routinely crack the top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and kid album charts. That\u2019s in addition to various themed compilations such as country, Christmas, \u201csports jamz,\u201d and the Spanish-language Los Kidz Bop. Having sold more than 15 million albums, the franchise has become a juggernaut in children\u2019s music, a precursor to \u201cGlee\u201d and Disney shows such as \u201cHannah Montana\u201d and \u201cHigh School Musical.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in 2000 the owners of the company were going to a bunch of kids\u2019 birthday parties, and they found that the music was not where it needed to be,\u201d says Victor Zaraya, Razor & Tie\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer. \u201cThe analogy we used to use is that the range was from Britney [Spears] to Barney. There was nothing in between.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think kids like hearing other kids sing,\u201d Zaraya adds. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to discount that.\u201d\n\nThe company holds national casting calls and talent searches to find singers for the series. Grant Knoche, a 12-year-old from Texas, became a member of the traveling Kidz Bop Kids ensemble, which comes to the Wilbur Theatre on June 27, after a rigorous audition process that included a two-day boot camp full of singing, dancing, and interviews.\n\n\u201cWe have to listen to the original song before we record it, but they send us the lyrics,\u201d Knoche says from his home in Dallas, with his father, Sean, also on the line. \u201cWhen we\u2019re traveling and songs we\u2019ve done come on the radio, we\u2019re all singing along but then hear a different word. And we\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s not how it goes!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a comfort for parents to know they can listen to pop songs and keep up with what\u2019s cool, but they\u2019re kid-friendly versions. It\u2019s good clean fun,\u201d says his dad, who mentions he left his six-figure job to support his son\u2019s budding career. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the Mickey Mouse Club of our modern time.\u201d\n\nZaraya says the series has tremendous oversight of what is appropriate for its young listeners; the target demographic is ages 5-10. A team decides which songs are good contenders, and because Kidz Bop stays so current and usually releases at least two albums a year, sometimes it has to forecast what will become a hit.\n\nSpending an hour with the Kidz Bop catalog is an astonishing reminder of just how un-kid-friendly most of today\u2019s pop music is. Some songs, particularly ones dealing with explicit sexuality, are inherently not suitable. The aforementioned \u201cAnaconda\u201d comes to mind, and Zaraya says Robin Thicke\u2019s divisive \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d while a major hit, certainly never made the cut.\n\nEven the most innocuous lyric suddenly carries the weight of issues parents might not want to address with their children just yet. On the newest Kidz Bop, which debuted at No. 10 last month, their version of Taylor Swift\u2019s recent hit \u201cBlank Space\u201d swaps out a crucial line \u2013 \u201cGot a long list of ex-lovers/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m insane\u201d \u2013 with the more generic, \u201cGot a long list of some others/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m to blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\u201d from Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d gets a PG-13 makeover: \u201cWill your mouth still remember the look of my love?\u201d Whereas Bruno Mars exclaims on \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too hot/ Hot damn!\u201d the Kidz Bop Kids brag, \u201cI\u2019m too hot/ Hot yeah!\u201d\n\nThe series has its detractors. The iTunes reviews are especially damning \u2013 \u201cplease parents, do not ruin your child\u2019s ears by making them listen to this\u201d or \u201cHonestly, u should just buy the regular song\u201d \u2013 criticisms Kidz Bop has battled since day one.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who criticizes us, I\u2019d say it\u2019s for kids primarily. It\u2019s not for teenagers, who I think are the harshest critics,\u201d Zaraya counters. \u201cIf you put aside your thoughts on why it\u2019s not as cool as the original and just embrace having a good time with pop music, then I think there\u2019s a time and place for Kidz Bop. We\u2019re not just a trend.\u201d",

        "text": "A week ago, it seemed almost certain: The Federal Reserve would raise its key short-term interest rate next month after holding it near zero for close to seven years. Policy makers, over the past few months, had signaled as much as the US economy continued to grow steadily and the unemployment rate continued to fall.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s gyrations in global stock markets, largely tied to fears about China\u2019s slowing economy, the debate over whether the Fed should hike rates was renewed. Fed officials themselves seemed rattled and divided what to do.\n\nOn Monday, as stocks plunged around the world, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said he expected policy makers to stick to the tentative plan to raise rates in September. But a few days later, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, tried to reassure markets by saying the argument for raising rates had become \u201cless compelling.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee meet Sept. 16 and 17. Should they raise interest rates?\n\nThose who favor raising rates basically argue, \u201cEnough already.\u201d\n\nUnemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent and the US economy, according to the Commerce Department, grew at a healthy 3.7 percent pace in the second quarter. There\u2019s simply no need for the Fed to keep propping up the economy with such low rates.\n\n\u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t looking at reality,\u201d said Alex J. Pollock, a resident fellow specializing in financial affairs at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe rates should be raised.\u201d\n\nLike others who favor a Fed rate increase, Pollock said Fed policies \u2014 low interest rates and the earlier \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy by buying government and other securities \u2014 have created distortions in markets that have led to surging stock, bond, and real estate prices. Continuing easy money policies risks a new burst of inflation and creating the type of bubbles that led to the last recession.\n\n\u201cYou look around Boston and other cities, like New York and San Francisco, and you see the effects \u2014 all the commercial construction going on, being built with cheap money,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief executive and chief economist at Decision Economics Inc., a Boston consulting firm. \u201cUltimately, it leads to excesses and problems.\u201d\n\nSinai said he placed odds of a Fed rate hike at about 70 percent heading into last week. But he said it\u2019s \u201cnow a tossup\u201d what the Fed will do next month.\n\nBased on futures prices, investors see a 38 percent chance the Fed will move at the September meeting of the Open Market Committee and a 49 percent probability of a rate rise at the Oct. 27-28 meeting, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThose who oppose raising rates at this point say, yes, the US economy has improved, but it\u2019s still fragile and recent world events make it vulnerable to a possible slowdown \u2014 or worse. Wages are barely growing, they say, a sign that the labor market might not be as strong as the unemployment rate suggests.\n\nOpponents of a rate hike note that the Fed normally raises interest rates when it fears a sharp increase in inflation. But the inflation rate is now only running at about 0.3 percent a year, well below the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2 percent. Falling oil and commodity prices are easing price pressures further.\n\nInflation, they add, is so low that a shock that further weakens the economy could lead to deflation, the destructive cycle of falling prices and wages, and high unemployment. The Great Depression was an extreme example of deflation. More recently, Japan has struggled for the better part of the last two decades to break a cycle of deflation and anemic economic growth.\n\n\u201cInflation is simply not a threat right now,\u201d said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any pressing reasons why the Fed needs to raise rates now.\u201d\n\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Tufts University, said he worries that raising interest rates now might further strengthen the US dollar, making American-produced goods more expensive overseas and hurting export sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cThey should absolutely not raise rates,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "David Armstrong, who has died at age 60 from liver cancer, never achieved the kind of recognition afforded his best friend, Nan Goldin, but his influence was acknowledged of late by a younger generation of photographers, including Ryan McGinley. \u201cHe has a specific style and owns it,\u201d McGinley told the New York Times in 2011, when Armstrong\u2019s book, 615 Jefferson Avenue, was published. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Vermeer, using only sunlight to illuminate uni-directionally. His photographs are about desire and despair. These are qualities he looks for in the boys\u2019 eyes.\u201d\n\nThe boys in question were the male models that Armstrong had been photographing between 2001 and 2011, making the beautiful young men seem both timeless and out-of-time in his curiously classical and unapologetically romantic portraits. Armstrong had come to fashion photography relatively late, having been commissioned by the young designer Hedi Slimane to shoot backstage at a Dior catwalk show in 2001. Suddenly, in middle age, he was hip again and also ubiquitous, shooting editorials for the likes Vogue Homme and Purple magazine. It was an unexpected \u2013 and, one could say, unrepresentative \u2013 coda to a remarkable life lived, in the main, on the margins amid fellow freaks and outsiders.\n\nBorn in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1954, Armstrong befriended Nan Goldin when he was 14. He later said: \u201cAll the cool kids who met in the morning to eat hash brownies talked about this legend, Nan Goldin, who got kicked out of school the year before.\u201d He was the first person she photographed and they remained close throughout their teenage years and into their early twenties, both attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, where he studied painting before switching to photography. Alongside the likes of Jack Pierson, Philip-Lorca di Corcia and Mark Morrisroe, they became part of \u201cthe Boston School\u201d, unified by their shared approach to the making of arrestingly intimate images of their often dissolute everyday lives.\n\nIn Boston, and later in New York\u2019s Lower East Side, they both shot the same subjects \u2013 the drag queens and druggies that they hung out with. \u201cWe both delved in different ways with things available to us and didn\u2019t consider going outside our worlds,\u201d he told the New York Times.\n\nLike Goldin, Armstrong also became enmeshed in the hard drug culture he portrayed. His first boyfriend died of Aids in 1983 and, the following year, he went home to Boston to come off heroin. He stayed clean for 17 years, but began using again in 2002 describing himself wryly as \u201cfunctioning enough\u201d.\n\nIn 1994, Armstrong collaborated with Goldin on a photobook called A Double Life, which showed in their dramatically contrasting styles just how much their lives had intertwined. Armstrong\u2019s formally austere style and monochrome tones make his images seem, if anything more haunting than Goldin\u2019s. \u201cI used to think Nan and I were complete opposites and it was all about the complement,\u201d he noted at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from that. At the same time we\u2019re identical - like our pictures. At first they seem to come from different planets but finally they arrive at the same place.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Morel Books published Night and Day, a selection of Kodachromes from Armstrong\u2019s extensive New York archive from the late 1970s and early 1980s. A tale of drug-taking, partying and comedowns from an already long-lost time, it includes portraits of artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Di Corcia alongside shots of beautiful young people at play in the early hours.\n\n\u201cHe was such a cool cat \u2013 cultured in that old-school way,\u201d says Aron Morel, who got to know him over the past few years. \u201cHe reminded me a bit of Boris Mikhailov: two guys that worked because they loved it. Artists without the art market. The first time I met him, he sent me back to London with over 300 \u2018chromes\u2019 of the Night and Day series. Just like that \u2013 with complete trust. He was such a poetic guy. He had recently moved to a house in upstate New York and he said he was going to live his last days like Mrs Haversham in her mansion.\u201d Sadly, that was not to be.",

        "text": "For those of you just joining us at home, the other day shares of a company with the ticker symbol NEST soared 1,900 percent after Google announced the acquisition of Nest Labs. This was incredibly stupid because Nest Labs has nothing at all to do with NEST. It seems like a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSo the question Levine raised is whether trading in shares of NEST would be insider trading if you had advanced knowledge of the Google deal? Does the law prohibit you from using non-public information about a deal to profit off of people stupidly buying a different stock altogether?\n\nIn my earlier piece, I argued that insider trading law does say you can't do this. If you got the information because you were, say, a guy making deal toys for the people involved, you aren't allowed to take the information that you were entrusted with and that belongs to others, in this case Google and Nest, and use it to trade for yourself. And if you got the information from your buddy who was involved in the deal somehow, then you inherit his breach of fiduciary duty and so you're in trouble.\n\nNot so fast, says Levine. To give rise to insider trading liability, information must not only be non-public. It must also be \"material.\" And, to make a long Levine post short, since Nest Labs has no relationship to NEST, information about Nest Labs cannot be material to NEST.\n\nThat seems rather straight forward and smart. But it's wrong.\n\nHere's how the judge instructed the jury in the recent case against Mark Cuban:\n\n\"Materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information. Materiality is not judged in the abstract, but in light of the surrounding circumstances. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the information would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder.\"\n\nSo here's something both the federal courts and the SEC consider to be an important factor when considering materiality: The effect on the stock's price. As the Third Circuit put it in Oran v. Stafford, \"when a stock is traded in an efficient market, the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement, in the period immediately following disclosure, of the price of the firm's stock.\"\n\nThe price of NEST shares rose 1,900 percent when the deal was disclosed. That pretty much screams materiality.\n\nLevine says that the information isn't material because the connection just isn't \"reasonable.\" Or, rather, that no reasonable investor in NEST would care about the acquisition of Nest Labs. Sure the stock price moved, but that was unreasonable. And stupid. So it's not material.\n\nThe problem with this line of argument is that in Levine's scenario, the investor with inside information buys shares of NEST as part of a scheme to trade from a mistake he anticipates occurring when the deal is announced. And then that mistake happened. That may be stupid but it's not unreasonable\n\nLet's put it this way. Would knowledge of the Google deal have played a part in the decision of owners of NEST to sell their shares the day before the deal was announced? It may not have been decisive but surely it would have played some part. I mean, you own shares of worthless stock that could have value tomorrow based on investor error. Why not hold it an extra day?\n\nMore importantly, I think Levine is wrong about the touch point of materiality. He assume that the information needs to be material about the company in which the shares actually were traded. That's incorrect, in my opinion. Keep in mind that in a misappropriation case, the duty breached that gives rise to illegality is not owed to the person on the other side of the trade. It's owed to the person who is the source of the information. The line of materiality should also connect not to the investors in NEST but back to the investors in the source of the information, Google. And for Google investors, the multi-billion acquisition almost certainly was material.\n\nMisappropriation is about using the information that belongs to others for your own benefit, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality toward them. When judging materiality, it only makes sense that the correct place to look is to the owners of the information.",

Starkness collides with splendor, masculinity with femininity, 90-degree angles with coy curves.

In case you don\u2019t get the joke, the concrete floor, as blank and brusque as the painting, also highlights the cheeky ornateness of the settee, ottoman and pillow.

        "text": "If you consider flying one of life\u2019s miseries, you might be flying the wrong airline.\n\nA new survey suggests that air travel is slowly improving, led by a small group of airlines.\n\nPassengers who fly JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines had the highest satisfaction rating \u2014 800 and 781, respectively, out of a possible score of 1000, according to J.D. Power\u2019s latest North America Airline Satisfaction study.\n\nOverall passenger satisfaction with major airlines increased to 717 out of a possible score of 1000 in 2015, up from 712 a year ago, according to J.D. Power\u2019s study.\n\nHere are some of the major findings:\n\nThe study gauged passenger satisfaction among both business and leisure passengers in several key areas, including costs, fees, in-flight services, onboard experience and reservations. It was conducted between April 2014 and March 2015. J.D. Power distinguishes between \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201clow-cost\u201d carriers in its ranking, but Fortune combined them for this report.\n\nThe findings reflect another recent study on airline service, which also suggested airline service was trending higher.\n\nTo put these scores into a little perspective, the top-ranked airline would receive an equivalent letter grade of \u201cB-.\u201d The highest-scoring legacy carrier, Delta Air Lines, would get a \u201cC-.\u201d The lowest-ranked carriers receive a grade of \u201cD,\u201d according to its customers.\n\nAirlines still rank below banks and mortgage lenders, two other industries covered by J.D. Power. \u201cAirline customer service experience is low,\u201d says Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nWhat the findings mean for customers\n\nJ.D. Power says the findings show that customer service matters, perhaps now more than ever. In its view, the airline industry is evolving from a commoditized transportation business into a business focused on hospitality and services.\n\n\u201cThe carriers most focused on providing a pleasant experience are being rewarded with higher customer satisfaction and loyalty,\u201d says Garlick.\n\nHe says the study suggests that when passengers make the decision to fly an airline based on the services or experience the airline provides, rather than price, convenient routes and scheduling, satisfaction is higher and passengers are more likely to return to the airline brand and to recommend it to others.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason for the uptick in scores, and they have nothing to do with better service.\n\n\u201cPeople have adapted to the airline fees that use to upset them,\u201d adds Garlick. \u201cSo it might be more accurate to say people are less dissatisfied.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the J.D. Power numbers shows how various airlines succeeded \u2014 and failed.\n\nAmerican and Delta surged ahead by investing in their customer service infrastructure and training, with an emphasis on high-revenue business travelers. Alaska\u2019s downward swing can be explained by some of its growing pains, as it expands to new cities where passengers are less familiar with the brand. And the failure of airlines such as United and Frontier? Garlick says those airlines have focused on low fares and high fees, to the detriment of customer service.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants low-cost travel,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s a price to be paid for it. The low-ranked carriers are running their companies so frugally that not even their core customers are satisfied. They\u2019re willing to pay for a better experience.\u201d\n\nA long way to go\n\nCritics agree that airline service still has a way to go before it can be considered good. \u201cAs the airlines have been complaining that customers are treating their seats like commodities, the airlines themselves are treating their passengers \u2014 except frequent flier elites and first class \u2014 like self-loading cargo,\u201d says Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy organization for air travelers. \u201cOnboard services have been ratcheted back, extra and exorbitant fees are being loaded on passengers, and legroom and seat sizes continue to shrink.\u201d\n\nLeocha says investing in customer service doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. A simple smile from flight attendants or gate agents, waiving a standby fee to get on an earlier flight with empty seats, allowing families to sit together without paying more, all make the travel experience far more pleasant.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he adds, \u201cthese amenities still seem to be in short supply.\u201d",

Near-term oscillators continue to point to the bearish side, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) still capped below 50 and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) line remaining under the signal and zero line,\" IG's market strategist Bernard Aw wrote in a note released Tuesday, adding that the 50-day moving average at S$0.828 will act as a \"formidable barrier\" for the stock.\n\nA dead cat bounce is a short-lived rally, often caused by short-covering, in a stock suffering from a prolonged decline.\n\nMost importantly, Aw said that weak underlying fundamentals remained the key obstacles for a recovery in the battered stock.\n\n\"The reality is that Noble is under pressure from several fronts, including a falling profit margin, a slowdown in commodity trading as well as issues relating to corporate governance and transparency. Piecemeal measures such as share buybacks are unlikely to relieve the downward pressure as long as the backdrop does not improve substantially,\" Aw said.\n\nFor CMC Markets' Nicholas Teo, the sustainability of the rebound depends on how aggressive Noble Group is with their share purchases.\n\n\"The rebound is relative on how much more the company wants to buy since they have in their authority to buy up to 673 million shares based on their filing.

        "text": "Stock markets are falling fast. After a dismal performance last week, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is struggling to climb back from a sharp early Monday drop, while markets all around the world have endured big losses.\n\nWhat\u2019s shaking investor confidence? In a word, China, where weak economic numbers and some increasingly desperate interventions by the state have awakened investors to the possibility of a painful slowdown.\n\nAdd in concerns about how malaise in China could hurt other developing countries, plus fears that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has lost its patience for necessary stimulus, and you have all the ingredients for a global sell-off.\n\nFor decades now, economic growth in China has been fiery, often reaching rates above 10 percent.\n\nBut those heady days of consistent, high-octane growth seem to be over. In the first half of 2015, China\u2019s growth rate was 7 percent, and that\u2019s if you believe the official numbers (for comparison, a recent independent analysis found that the true unemployment rate in China may be nearly three times the official rate).\n\nThe slump is part of a global wave of selling triggered by increased signs of an economic slowdown in China.\n\nFears were stoked earlier this month when China removed some of the limits on currency trading and the value of the yuan fell substantially. Even though the Chinese government was probably hoping for the yuan to lose some value, investors interpreted the drop as a sign of weakness.\n\nThat\u2019s because China was supposed to be moving past the export-first phase of its development \u2014 no longer just a place for companies to make cheap products, but a mature consumer market where companies from around the world can sell their goods to the growing Chinese middle class.\n\nAlso disconcerting was the way the Chinese government handled its July stock market collapse, where it intervened aggressively to prop up stock prices, suggesting that it isn\u2019t ready to let markets operate on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to exaggerate the connection between market fluctuations and events around the world. There\u2019s a lot of unpredictability in market movements, and it\u2019s often impossible to tease out the deeper forces driving markets.\n\nBut here\u2019s how the slowdown in China might be feeding the current troubles.\n\nThe most basic reason stock prices fall is because investors start to think \u2014 or fear \u2014 that companies are going to perform worse than previously anticipated. And if China is facing a severe economic slowdown \u2014 one that could hamper the development of a robust Chinese consumer class \u2014 some companies would indeed have a smaller market for their goods. That means lower profits, less money to share with investors, and lower stock prices.\n\nChina is far from the only thing weighing down markets. Other concerns include:\n\n\u25a0 Contagion: If China\u2019s economy really is slowing, lots of other countries will suffer alongside. As an example, a slowing China would probably need less oil, driving down oil prices and hurting oil-dependent economies like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u25a0 Rising interest rates: For months the Federal Reserve has been preparing investors for a hike in interest rates. But the point of raising rates is to keep the US economy from overheating. And with China\u2019s slowdown threatening the US economy, the big challenge may be to heat the economy back up, not cool it down.\n\n\u25a0 An overdue correction: The stock market has been outperforming the US economy ever since the Great Recession. There\u2019s some good reason for that, including the fact that corporate profits have been particularly strong. But the market can only run so far ahead of the real economy before some kind of correction sets in. And that may be what we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nSometimes a sharp downturn in the markets is followed by an equally sharp recovery. Other times, there\u2019s no such rapid rebound. After the black Monday sell-off in 1987, it took more than a year for the S&P 500 to recoup its losses. After the tech bubble burst in 2000, it took about six years.\n\nOne hopeful precedent is the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which swept through much of southeast Asia and initially sent the US stock market tumbling. Within a few months, all those losses had been recouped.\n\nThen again, in 1997 China was largely insulated from Asia\u2019s economic troubles. That\u2019s not true this time around, and it could mean a wider fallout, a slower recovery, and possibly some spillover from a stock market crisis into a full-on economic downturn.",

He had intended to publish a major treatise but, like so much of his work, it was never completed as he was constantly distracted by new projects.\n\nAll the drawings had been imported into England by the 17th century, bound into an album which was probably bought by Charles II, and have been in the Royal Collection since at least 1690.\n\nSome of the anatomical drawings were exhibited in the Queen's Gallery in London last year, but the Edinburgh show will be the first to compare Leonardo's results with scalpel and pen with the best results of modern technology.\n\nClayton said: \"For the first time we will be displaying the artist's works alongside stunning examples of medical imaging, showing how the concerns and methods of the world's leading anatomists have changed little in 500 years, and how truly groundbreaking Leonardo's work was.\n\nThe exhibition will show how close Leonardo got in some of his last medical experiments to discovering the role of the beating heart in the circulation of the blood, a century before William Harvey worked it out.\n\nIn 1508 he dissected a 100-year-old man, and recorded accurately for the first time cirrhosis of the liver, and narrowing of the arteries.

Amazing, eh?\n\nBut the average after-market return (after the first day) has been a DECLINE of 11.3 percent.\n\nTake Castlight Health (CSLT),which went public on March 13. It provides software that helps self-insured employers control healthcare costs. The original price talk was $9-$11, it priced at $16, and the first day closed over $40, up 148 percent. Wow!\n\nIt is now at $13.80, 13 percent below its IPO price.\n\nHuh? The stock is UP 148 percent on its first day, and is now 13 percent below its IPO price?\n\nTake a look at the prices of a few other tech or tech-like companies after their first day of trading:\n\nWhat happened? Two things happened: 1) the overall market uptrend broke in the beginning of April, and 2) the appetite for high-risk/high-growth waned.\n\nIn the case of Castlight, this was one of those cloud companies with no earnings, a subscription model.\n\nHere's another example: Varonis (VRNS), which provides software that manages data security and other data, went public February 27 at $22. It closed over $40 on the first day, up 100 percent.\n\nOK, you say, it's still above its initial price. But, I ask you: if you were an average investor who bought this stock for $40 on the first day, how would you feel about buying more IPOs after seeing this one trading at $26 six weeks later?\n\nAt least there's no tech IPOs coming next week. There's Papa Murphy's (FRSH), a pizza company, but the biggest deal is Ares Asset Management (ARES), an \"alternative\" asset management company. The word \"alternative\" is a phrase meaning \"anything but stocks.\"\n\nSo what's next? Oddly, nothing has jumped on to the calendar recently. The deal calendar is very low. There is silence.\n\nThat's a sign the market is under stress.\n\nHere's how it works: A company announces it has filed to go public. Right now, there are 118 IPOs that have filed to go public, trying to raise $25 billion, according to Renaissance.\n\nThey include companies like Box, Synchrony Financial (consumer lending arm of GE), and JD.com (Chinese online sales platform).\n\nAnd that's just those that are public; there are probably 100 that are in \"confidential\" filings with the SEC that have not been publicly announced yet.\n\nBut there's a big gap between ANNOUNCING you are going public and GOING public.\n\nSome time after announcing it's going public, the company will set terms by announcing a price range for the IPO, then will begin a road show. It tells you it is actively marketing. Then it goes public.\n\nThe time between setting terms and going public is usually about two weeks.\n\nBut suddenly, we don't hear anything from the hot space: Technology.\n\nNot a single tech company has filed for terms since Sabre (SABR) last week.\n\nThat means no tech companies are beginning road shows. Why not? Because they are afraid.\n\nOf course, IPO issuers are still talking up the business. They say, \"Look how many IPOs have been done, you can go too!\"\n\nBut that's a bad way to look at it. When you price below the price talk, or the low end of the price talk, that's a disappointment.\n\nWhen you have the kind of declines we have seen from the first day pops, that's a disappointment.\n\nThis is a good turn of events. We did have froth. This is now taking froth out.\n\nIt will set up for the next round. Some companies may not make it, but most will go public. But they will come at lower prices. Good for investors.\n\nWhat needs to happen? First, we need the stock market to stabilize. Then, we need more stability in the IPO market.\n\nWatch the Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of over 60 IPOs, which is now down 2.8 percent this year, versus a decline of 0.7 percent for the S&P 500. It's down 12 percent since hitting its high in early March. That's where to look for stability.\n\nAnd watch to see if any tech companies announce price terms next week and begin a road show. If we hear nothing\u2014silence\u2014that will be the biggest indicator of all the IPO boom has withered. For the moment.",

        "text": "In most major department stores, you have to hunt for the plus-size section, which is often tucked away in a far-flung corner. And, even when you find it, you\u2019re likely to encounter a slim, less-than-fashionable selection.\n\nBut go home, open up your computer and search for plus-size clothes online and you\u2019ll find a slew of websites selling stylish, high-quality garments.\n\nThe plus-size industry is growing. Sales climbed by 5% last year and the industry is now valued at $17.5 billion, according to Bloomberg. But the sector has been slow to move from online to brick-and-mortar stores. Now, that\u2019s beginning to change.\n\nAfter spending time modeling and blogging, Aimee Cheshire launched HeyGorgeous.com in 2014. Her goal was to provide plus-size women with an online retailer that stocked clothes with same style and quality as those sold by any trendy \u201cstraight-size\u201d company.\n\nBut a year after launching the online business, Cheshire realized there was more for HeyGorgeous to offer.\n\n\u201cWe take for granted the ease of going online and forget that human touch and interacting\u2014creating relationships\u2014is so important,\u201d Cheshire said. \u201cI forgot how much I enjoy being with my customers, and talking to them on a one-on-one basis and just touching, feeling, talking about the clothes.\u201d\n\nSo HeyGorgeous opened a showroom at the company\u2019s midtown Manhattan office. Clients can reserve a time, pick their clothing preferences and show up to a glamorous, personalized fitting.\n\n\u201cIf they come to the showroom and have a great experience and sip champagne and are chatting, they feel a little more comfortable trying on clothes that may be sleeveless or try a higher price-point that they\u2019re used to,\u201d Cheshire says.\n\nCheshire says she wanted to bring the human experience back to shopping for plus-size clothing. Many of her customers are used going into a store with straight-size friends and knowing that they won\u2019t be able to wear the clothes, she said. But the HeyGorgeous showroom changes that.\n\n\u201cYou want to experience the fun of shopping with your friends,\u201d Cheshire says. \u201cI want to give that opportunity to women who never had that before. It\u2019s quite exciting when you\u2019re finding clothes that your [non-plus-size] friends can\u2019t fit into or doesn\u2019t come in their size. I think there\u2019s something to be said for that experience.\u201d\n\nHeyGorgeous isn\u2019t the only plus-size ecommerce player exploring brick-and-mortar outposts. Online retailer ModCloth, which sells clothing from sizes XS to 4X, has been experimenting with in-person shops. In April, ModCloth decided to open a Los Angeles pop-up shop, called ModCloth IRL (in real life).\n\n\u201cMost of the folks at ModCloth had never interacted with the customer,\u201dsays CEO Matt Kaness. So they decided to do ModCloth IRL to allow the actual buyers and design team to work with customers by taking measurements, helping shoppers with fit and giving styling advice.\n\nWhen the pop-up was a hit, ModCloth opened a temporary fit shop in San Francisco with the intent of staying open for three weeks. Kaness says the shop has done so well that company has renewed the lease twice and now plans to remain open until early January.\n\nKaness, too, says he\u2019s witnessed the power of giving plus-size women a place to shop in the real world. He recounts a story told to him by Christine Shoptaw de Chavez, ModCloth\u2019s tech design manager. According to Kaness, Shoptaw de Chavez was helping one of the pop-up customers, when the shopper apologized for her body shape.\n\n\u201cChristine said, \u2018You\u2019re exactly the size that you should be. Don\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s our job to make you feel beautiful,\u2019 And the woman started crying,\u201d says Kaness.\n\nFor Kaness, that fit shops are a way to create that type of relationship between ModCloth and more of the company\u2019s customers.\n\n\u201cAs we thought about the future for ModCloth offline, it was that experience in a fitting room that one customer had that I think inspired all of us to want to recreate that,\u201d says Kaness.\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.",

Sometimes the scandal is not what law was broken, but what the law allows.\u201d\n\nThroughout 2015 the Australian parliament enacted a series of controversial laws that curbed privacy and freedom of expression rights.\n\nGeoffrey King, director of the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Technology Program, said the AFP\u2019s actions were \u201cobviously outrageous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis should not be happening. But it is the inevitable result of mandatory data retention and mass surveillance, which is neither necessary nor proportional to any threat,\u201d King said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the values that we all adhere to, to good counter-terrorism strategy, and it certainly doesn\u2019t line up with a free and open society where journalists can do their jobs.\u201d\n\nIn March 2015 the Australian Senate passed legislation requiring internet and mobile phone companies to retain customer metadata for 24 months. The bill was vehemently opposed by the Australian Greens, whose communications spokesman, Senator Scott Ludlam, called its new provisions a \u201cform of mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nAlthough a last-minute amendment obliged security agencies to get a warrant before accessing a journalist\u2019s metadata, the law essentially expands the Australian government\u2019s ability to conduct dragnet surveillance.\n\nAustralia, along with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, is part of the Five Eyes signals-intelligence sharing network.\n\nDocuments leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that Australian spying authorities had offered to share bulk metadata of ordinary Australian citizens with their partners in the Five Eyes network. Other documents Snowden leaked revealed Australian spies had attempted to listen in to the phone calls of former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, causing an extended diplomatic rift between the two countries.\n\nThe investigation into Farrell\u2019s sources, for a story relating to the activities of an Australian customs vessel and a controversial operation to turn back a boat carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia, was conducted in 2014, before the amendment passed parliament. Law enforcement did not need a warrant for accessing the information at the time.\n\nThe case marks the first time the AFP has confirmed seeking access to a journalist\u2019s metadata in a specific case, although the agency has admitted to investigating several journalists reporting on Australian immigration.\n\nThe acknowledgement that authorities had sought access to Farrell\u2019s records was only divulged after the reporter lodged a complaint with Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner under the country\u2019s Privacy Act.\n\nRelated: The AFP and me: how one of my asylum stories sparked a 200-page police investigation\n\nIn July 2015, the Australian government passed the Border Force Act, which criminalises whistleblowing from within Australia\u2019s hardline immigration detention network, making it an offense punishable with up to two years in prison.\n\nThe country\u2019s \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders\u201d, a harsh, military-led crackdown on asylum seekers who attempt to enter Australia by boat, includes a policy of turning back boats carrying migrants and deporting every arrival including children to harsh, offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific island state of Nauru, for permanent resettlement.",

Neither PwC, Deloitte, EY, nor Bain and Co. reveal their diversity numbers in this level of detail.

(The company has pledged to hire an additional 5,000 vets or spouses of vets by 2020.)\n\nAccenture has committed to releasing updated diversity numbers each year. Although it did not lay out specific goals for 2016, Sweet is clear that she expects the company to make gains over last year\u2019s stats: \u201cWe think we can do more.\u201d\n\nMaking the numbers public will hold the company accountable for showing improvement, she says. What\u2019s more, Sweet hopes that this new level of transparency will allow Accenture to have more explicit, productive discussions about race and gender internally.\n\nTo help speed the pace of change, the company also announced that it is starting a new referral program that will reward employees who refer women, black, Hispanic, and veteran candidates who end up getting hired. This comes on the heels of a slate of new parent-friendly policies announced last year, including 16 paid weeks of maternity leave and an option for new parents to work locally for one year after the birth of their child.\n\n\u201cWhen I took my new role as chief executive of North America, I had this realization that with 48,000 and a $14 billion business I had a real opportunity to make change \u2014 and I feel a deep sense of responsibility,\u201d Sweet says. \u201cI personally feel I will have failed if I do not make progress toward making us the most inclusive and diverse workforce in the U.S.\u201d",

Nothing I could do about it but watch storm footage on CNN International while drinking non-alcoholic Budweiser (no booze in the kingdom) and listening to the sounds of the muzzein calling Muslims to worship at the mosque behind the Marriott.\n\nThat was the same month that the financial crisis hit, and on the day of Lehman Brothers' ( LEHMQ - news - people ) collapse I spent the evening with billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal at his camp in the desert outside of Riyadh. We sat in the open air, under a starry sky, on an expanse of Persian rugs that must have taken up a quarter-acre. He was attended by a cadre of Bedouin servants who wore little pistols in their belts and continually refilled our little china cups with strong yellow Arabian coffee. A news junkie, the prince had three mega-screen TVs set up across the island of rugs from us. The biggest one in the middle was tuned to CNBC. The others showed pilgrims in Mecca walking around the Kaaba. It was the holy month of Ramadan. As we watched coverage of the financial collapse, Al-Waleed had the awesome idea of text-messaging CNBC's Maria Bartaromo his thoughts on Lehman. I think he was doing it mostly to show off that he had Maria's number in his phone, and I was impressed when she responded to his text 10 minutes later and asked him to be on her show the next day.\n\nLater in the evening I watched in disbelief as a line of about 500 Saudi men formed in the darkness, and one by one the men came forward to pay homage to the prince and ask him for some form of charity (money for a car, tuition, dowry, debts, etc). Several young men recited poems to the prince, who all the while continued to watch TV or check his phone. He holds court like this every week, giving away millions in patronage each year. The prince spends a lot of time in the desert and says he doesn't go to sleep until he sees the sky begin to brighten with dawn.\n\nA couple days later I found myself in the desert again, this time in the white-leather backseat of a 10-year-old Crown Victoria being driven the four hours from Riyadh to Damman, where I was to tour the headquarters of oil company Saudi Aramco. During Ramadan Saudis are barred from eating or drinking anything from sunup to sundown. But there was no prohibition on rock and roll; the driver, without comment, popped a cassette tape of Aerosmith's greatest hits into the stereo, and we screamed over the pristine blacktop at 90 miles an hour. Finally, when the red ball dipped under the desert horizon, my driver pulled into a truckstop (which, other than oilfield flares and a few camels, was the only sign of life in the desert) and bought us some snacks and water. I had been abstaining from food during the day as well, in part to see how the Saudis did it, and also because there was none for sale until nightfall. A few minutes later the driver pulled off the road to pray. I sat in the parked car and ate the most delicious bag of chips ever, all the while marveling that Aerosmith's \"Crazy\" was a much better song than I ever remembered.

It is totally unacceptable for anyone to tarnish its reputation by using old Mexican small-town vote-rigging tactics either to get back at Mrs Josefina Vazquez\u00b4s use of The Economist at the first televised presidential debate against Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or as a propaganda tool in the next debate.\n\nLet\u00b4s see the numbers.For those unfamiliar with Mexico\u00b4s presidential election to be held July 1, 2012,there are four candidates.One of them, from the teacher\u00b4s union, has never polled above 5%.The ones with real chances are Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto from PRI, who polled formerly as high as 42% and now in the low 30s; Mrs.Josefina Vazquez, from the ruling center-right PAN,now in third and formerly in second place, polling in the high 20s, and Mr. AMLO from the center-left PRD, now in second place, polling in the low 30s but behind Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Some polls speak of a four point spread between the two, others point to a ten point spread.\n\nBut the essence of the matter is that all parties as well as the voters they represent are united in this: they are all against PRI and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto ever claiming back the presidency they lost in the year 2000.Thus if Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto has 34% or 42 % of the votes, by definition that means that either 66% or 58% of all voters are opposed to the proposition that \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your poll shows 30% of the people opposing your motion instead of the 60-70% indicated by all polls conducted in Mexico is a first sign of trouble.Only the staff at The Economist knows how many votes have originated outside Mexico.If the numbers do not change much once these non-Mexico originated votes have been removed, the idea of vote manipulation gathers strength.\n\nNow, the people most likely to read this newspaper in Mexico, and thus vote in your debate, are naturally highly educated professionals.But you see, the latest poll gruporeforma.blogs.com/encuestas confirms the well-known fact that this demographic is overwhelmingly against the PRI, and has been so for at least 20 years, if not more.The affluent and well-educated are mostly PRD and to a certain extend PAN.In Mexico City, for example, PRD has a twenty-point lead.The actual numbers nationwide are:For voters with only primary education PRI 41%,PRD 30%, PAN 25%.For voters with college education:PRI 28%, PRD 43%, PAN 21%.Therefore, among the people most likely to read TE less than 30% would agree with your proposition, yet your numbers show just the opposite result.\n\nOr do they? Well, actually the opinions stated in your 116 Opening Comments,50 Rebuttal Comments, 541 Opening Recommendations and 286 Rebuttal Recommendations if carefully tabulated and analyzed are totally supportive of those rough numbers of 70% of voter\u00b4s negating PRI\u00b4s returning to the Presidency and below 30% believing \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your comments are in statistical agreement with the numbers we would expect from a multitude of polls, while your poll debate numbers are so divergent as to be mirror images of the former is a clear indication of voter fraud.\n\nIf we read carefully the 116 Opening Comments we see only 105 are real comments, since people sometimes mistakenly click on to post before they have actually written any comment.About 10% of these 105 indicate no decision on the debate\u00b4s proposition, but rather speak of various tangential matters such as the convenience for non-Mexicans to abstain from voting(the opinion of that gentleman who wisely retired to sunny Portugal,SaintMartinian),or to buy beach-front property(YukonDave),teachers saying they will use the debate in their classroom...and a funny Mexican who thinks his country would be better served if it were a colony of Sweden or The Netherlands(recommended by 3)...or another one who says Mexico would have been better off if it had not declared independence from Spain.",

        "text": "A detail from Saying Farewell at Xunyang, by Qiu Ying, c1500-50 Photograph: John Lamberton/Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art\n\nOn 5 August 1473, a young artist drew the first ever landscape. The date is known precisely because Leonardo da Vinci wrote it on the sheet of paper, as if aware of the revolutionary nature of what he was doing. To look at mountains and trees just for themselves was unprecedented.\n\nOr was it? The invention of landscape painting is one of the great moments of European art. Painting nature is a way to get inside yourself. To this day, people enjoy doing watercolours in the outdoors as a form of meditation. Leonardo's discovery of the mystery of nature \u2013 which you see in all his paintings, with their dreamy rocks and pools \u2013 is the invention of a new kind of inner life.\n\nYet it is a lot less original than we might like to think. There is an uncanny likeness between Leonardo's rocks, trees and rivers and the rocks, trees and rivers that Chinese artists were painting centuries before he was born. It is bizarre: that 1473 drawing actually looks like a reworking of classic Chinese paintings such as Li Gongnian's Winter Evening Landscape. When was that painted? I look at the label in the V&A's new exhibition Masterpieces of Chinese Painting. It says 1120. That's 353 years before the very similar sketch by Leonardo.\n\nIt is conventional, nowadays, to pay lip service to the fact that many versions of art exist, that beautiful art comes from all over the world and every way of life. Yet the story of art that most of us absorb \u2013 as told in The Story of Art by EH Gombrich, first published in 1950 and still the definitive account of art's progress \u2013 puts European innovation at the centre of the action. All peoples make art, but the west takes it forward.\n\nMasterpieces of Chinese Painting is the most devastating refutation of such assumptions I have ever seen. It shows that during the Song dynasty, at a time when Europeans were fighting barbaric crusades and had long forgotten the creativity that flourished in ancient Greece, artists in China were taking painting to heights of sensitivity and poetry that would not be attained elsewhere until the ages of Leonardo \u2013 or for that matter, when you look at the most radical Chinese touches, Van Gogh.\n\nI'd go further. Looking at this show being installed and talking to its curator Zhang Hongxing, I can't resist airing the theory that Leonardo stole the idea of landscape painting from China. Could he somehow have seen Chinese paintings? Might something have reached the west along the Silk Road? Excitedly, I get Leonardo's 1473 drawing up on my iPad and hold it among the 12th-century Chinese landscapes for comparison. The shapes of the hills and trees in Leonardo's sketch perfectly mirror the sugar-loaf peaks and willowy trees in 900-year-old Chinese paintings.\n\nZhang's well aware of this idea: it was raised very seriously in the 1950s, he says, but there is no proof. It's a mystery. Nor is Leonardo the only European pioneer of landscape who looks \"Chinese\". Zhang points out that Pieter Bruegel the Elder is also very \"Chinese\" looking. This is true. Bruegel's much-loved Hunters in the Snow has all the elements that delighted medieval Chinese landscape painters, including all that snow.\n\nBut why did China invent landscape art in the first place? Why did artists begin to depict, not gods and battles as elsewhere, but the grandeur of nature? It has something to do with Buddhism, which spread to China before AD1,000 and inspired a culture of contemplation. It also has to do with the technical achievements of the Song era. The scientific mind that perfected porcelain also looked at nature with a new clarity.\n\nOne of the first things you see in the show was actually painted by a Song emperor \u2013 though it comes with a warning to rulers, for Emperor Huizong's dreamy fascination with art helped to lose him his throne. Indeed, as the curator explains, painting in China has always been associated with retreat and escapism. Not all the works in this exhibition are landscapes. There are pictures of courtesans and the tremendous Nine Dragons, a dazzling mythic vision painted by Chen Rong in 1244. Yet for me, the escapist pursuit of pastoral in China's pioneering landscapes is utterly beguiling. After the Mongols conquered China there was a clear association of art with the rejection of power. Turning their backs on the court, intellectuals created gardens, wrote poetry and painted expressive scenes of wintry trees. They rendered nature in a free, subjective style that anticipated \u2013 and of course, influenced \u2013 Van Gogh.\n\nPersonally, I am convinced that Leonardo must have got access to the art of China. He was fascinated by the east and once applied for a job in Istanbul, offering to serve the Ottoman empire and praising Allah in a letter that survives. Did all this interest in Asia lead him to some hushed library where he unrolled a silk scroll and saw mountains, cherry blossoms and water?\n\nOne thing is certain. Zhang's great exhibition turns the story of art upside down.",

        "text": "When the dust settles on this year of spectacle and recession-proof Olympic construction, of teetering steel pointing to the sky, of swinging cranes, mayoral openings and breathless press releases, of the mighty Shard and the risible Orbit, one of the most memorable works will turn out to be something invisible above ground, and largely the creation of little-known 1950s engineers. This is the conversion of the oil tanks of the former Bankside power station in London \u2013 a clover of three buried concrete cylinders \u2013 into new spaces for performance and exhibition for Tate Modern, which is what the power station became in 2000.\n\nThis project is by the Basel-based firm of Herzog & de Meuron, architects of that icon of icons, the stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics \u2013 or Bird's Nest, as the architects don't like it to be called. The stadium set out to be a modern Eiffel Tower and succeeded, impressing its image on global television audiences of billions: of all the attention-seeking buildings of recent years, it commanded as much attention as any.\n\nThe Tanks at Tate Modern are a work of uncovering as much as addition, and finding rather than making, and there is not much chance that they will imprint their image on the world's imagination. You may indeed not be overwhelmingly excited by the photographs on this page, as the Tanks are hard to capture with a lens. They are voids rather than objects, things to be experienced rather than seen.\n\nThey are not, however, exactly modest. Each has a height of 7 metres and a diameter of 30 metres. Built to hold the fuel that powered the turbines that generated electricity for a large chunk of the capital, and to withstand the risk of explosion, they are thick-walled and capacious, a trefoil of inside-out towers, or a castle in negative.\n\nThey have the confident geometry of things made not for appearance but for a substantial practical use, and their concrete surfaces have a raw force. They are impressive just for being there, and the architects' approach has been largely to let their size and mass speak for themselves.\n\nOne cylinder has been made into a performance space, another into a room for temporary installations with a preference for those using moving images. The third tank has been subdivided into the functions, such as dressing rooms, needed to serve the other two. Floors, ceiling and lighting have been added as necessary to fulfil their new tasks. On the approach to the Tanks you see an archaeology of patches and slatherings of concrete, marks of the changes and repairs made to the structure over the years.\n\nUnless you are a connoisseur of concrete techniques during the second Elizabethan era, you don't greatly distinguish between the changes made this year and those of a half-century ago. As in Astley Castle in Warwickshire, you're presented with a composite of past and present, where the joins between the two are not strongly marked. For an architect on such projects, according to Pierre de Meuron, \"it is mostly good advice to disappear, as you leave your traces anyway. It looks as if it has been so forever but it was actually different before.\" The urge to dramatise what is already impressive has been avoided.\n\nRooflights could have been added, such that daylight could have gushed into the Tanks and made them into romantic Piranesian ruins, but Jacques Herzog says this \"would have been a trap \u2013 it becomes kitsch if you make too much of it\". The way that he and de Meuron have designed it is to stress that \"it is really an underground space\". Each tank has \"a door and that's it. It's just very straightforward.\"\n\nThe effect of this approach is to flatten the experience of the Tanks, such that their scale grows on you rather than amazes you all at once.\n\nIt also allows them to function as background to the performances and installations they will hold, rather than be the star turn in themselves. They will only be completed by the things that will happen in them, which is as it should be. And if you want drama there is no shortage of it in the Turbine Hall next door, or in a multi-storey twisted brick pyramid that is about to rise over the Tanks.\n\nIt's tempting to see the fondness of digging and revealing as a sign of our less shiny times, and it can also be seen in the same architects' Serpentine Pavilion, and their plans for renovating the giant Park Avenue Armory in New York, but as the Tanks and the pyramid together will cost \u00a3215m, this new modesty would have to be taken at a purely symbolic level. It would be more accurate to see it as a continuation of the original idea of 1994, when it was first decided to make an old power station into the Tate's new gallery of modern art.\n\nThe plan was derided at the time, as a backward-looking, heritage-obsessed failure to take the opportunity to commission proud new buildings, but the success of the Turbine Hall showed that it can be as powerful to use and modify found spaces as make new ones. The Tanks, meanwhile, remained a great secret place, buried beneath the grass behind Tate Modern. It was a particular obsession of Tate's director Nick Serota (who liked, evidently, to park his tanks under the lawn) to bring them into use.\n\n\"I want those oil tanks,\" he told his architects, \"even if I don't know how to use them,\" and eventually art based on performance and moving images provided the reason, and Tate's genius for fundraising came up with the cash. And so an intriguing new republic has been added to Tate's imperium, or a new district to its city of art. Visitors will now have a reason to turn right after passing through Tate Modern's main entrance, where at the moment all the interest is on the left.\n\nThere is an obvious danger in pursuing space for its own sake, which is that whatever goes in it feels like a pretext, a token gesture embarrassed by its setting. There is also a danger that Tate's relentless expansion will bloat it, and make it in the end an exhausting barrage of over-spectacular presentations. With an exhibition area of 1,800 sq metres, the Tanks are more than half as big as the not-small Turbine Hall, and exceed the display space of entire regional galleries, such as the Turner Contemporary in Margate.\n\nBut at this point, not yet tested by use, the Tanks feel credible.\n\nThere seems to be a purpose to their intended programming with film and performance, and they are distinctive enough \u2013 exceptionally so \u2013 to be rather more than another dollop of space in the Tate's halls. In the end, these underground chambers are simply extraordinary places, of a kind that would not now be invented from scratch. It would have been a shocking not to make use of them.\n\nThe Tanks at Tate Modern, London SE1 open on 18 July with Art in Action, a 15-week festival of performance and installation art",

The two are irked to meet again, but gradually, each fills a void in the other\u2019s brood. Lauren is great with lullabies, and rightly points out that Jim\u2019s oldest daughter (Bella Thorne) might prefer something girlier than the barbershop haircuts he gets her. (Uncomfortable tomboy jokes are only made odder by Thorne\u2019s resemblance to Keira Knightley.) Jim, meanwhile, knows just what Lauren\u2019s younger boy (Kyle Red Silverstein) needs: a father figure who actually cares. Enough, even, to join him in cartoonish craziness like ostrich riding.\n\n\u201cYou gotta show up for your kids,\u201d Jim tells Lauren in a likably sentimental bit of parental philosophizing. Of course, this being an Adam Sandler movie, he and director pal Frank Coraci (\u201cWedding Singer,\u201d \u201cClick\u201d) hedge their narrative bets by glopping on the anything-goes humor that fans expect.\n\nSome of it works. Sandler and Barrymore have some great interaction with Alyvia Alyn Lind, who plays Jim\u2019s youngest daughter with a very funny mouths-of-babes streak. But while a Greek chorus styled like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and led by preening Terry Crews is gleefully wacky, don\u2019t be surprised if the caricatured African setting draws some complaints. The location feels more like a random choice than a thematically relevant one, and at times it plays like an ad for South Africa\u2019s infamously segregated Sun City resort.\n\nFunny thing, though: The sunnier that Barrymore gets in her scenes with Sandler, the more the iffy elements and leaden bits seem to just melt away.

In those days intelligence tests, developed during World War I, were accepted as an infallible means of identifying the \u201chighly intelligent.\u201d\n\nHe called attention to the problem by denouncing higher education as more devastating to the human race than war.\n\nIn 1929 he said that the fu\u00adture would see a larger pro\u00adportion of Negroes in the North than in the South, a forecast that anticipated the movement of the Negro north but exag\u00adgerated its scope. He advanced evidence that Southern Negroes were able to adapt to the more rigorous climate of the north.\n\nMost of Dr. Holmes's chal\u00adlenging statements reflected the position of some of the pioneers of eugenics, who were unaware that large gaps existed in their knowledge.\n\nIn 1939, as president of the Western division of the Ameri\u00adcan Association for the Ad\u00advancement of Science, he urged the substitution of a Darwinian code of morals for the ancient Hebraic and Christian codes.\n\nThe Darwinian code, present\u00aded as an outgrowth of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, accepts cruelty, lust, deceit, cowardice and selfishness as in\u00adtrinsic \u201cvirtues\u201d but disapproves their abuse, he said.\n\nThis idea, not original withDr. Holmes, was developed into a social philosophy called \u201cso\u00adcial Darwinism,\u201d which had a certain vogue in Nazi Germany and other countries but which later fell into disrepute.\n\nThis public image tended to obscure the fact that he was one of the world's foremost au\u00adthorities on zoology and genetics, internationally known for his studies of animal hered\u00adity and behavior. He was one of the first scientists to recognize that radiation could create monsters.\n\nDr. Holmes was born in Henry, Ill. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in science at the University of California and his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Chicago in 1897. After a year of teaching in the public schools of California, Dr. Holmes was an instructor in zoology for six years at the University of Mich\u00adigan.\n\nHe then transferred to the University of Wisconsin, where he remained until 1912, when he went to California as an asso\u00adciate professor. He became pro\u00adfessor in 1917. Dr. Holmes taught at California, and also at the Marine Biological Labor\u00adatory at Wood's Hole, until his retirement in 1939.\n\nHe married Cecelia WarfieldSkinner in 1909.

An oval, suspended by steel beams, emits a soft-white hue; eventually, curious park visitors decide to take a seat. Faces light up, figuratively and literally, when the oval begins to glow \u2014 first blue, then varying shades of purple-pink \u2014 as a sitter swings to and fro.\n\n\u201cSwing Time,\u201d which in its finished form consists of 20 glowing oval swings in three different sizes, is the first interactive art piece to be added to the Lawn on D. Commissioned by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, the glowing swing set contains LED lights that activate based on the swings\u2019 movement. An internal accelerometer measures speeds, which signal the color changes.\n\nThe swing set is part of the MCCA\u2019s initiative to create the first interactive public space in Boston. \u201cWe wanted to have a piece that would entice anyone to use it, not just stop and stare,\u201d said Jim Rooney, executive director of the MCCA.\n\nPart playground implement, part art installation, \u201cSwing Time\u201d was designed by Eric Howeler and Meejin Yoon of the Boston firm Howeler and Yoon Architecture. The husband-and-wife team has designed several art pieces meant to activate public spaces, including the award-winning \u201cWhite Noise/White Light\u201d field at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.\n\nHoweler, also an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said he wanted to blend the ideas of a responsive environment and a play space to \u201cSwing Time,\u201d in order to entice park goers to physically interact with it.\n\n\u201cThe stuff between buildings is often left to happenstance, and one of the best ways to bring life to the public realm is through art pieces like this one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stop playing at a certain age. And we were tasked with figuring out how to get everyone, including adults, to play.\u201d\n\nThe swing set joins several activities already dispersed across the 2.7-acre green space. The WiFi-equipped park offers bocce ball, corn hole, and other yard games, as well as an open-air bar Thursday through Sunday. The space hosts music events, and serves as a reception area for events at the BCEC.\n\nRooney hopes that the many organizations and visitors who make their way to the waterfront for conventions, family outings, and the like will take advantage of the Lawn, designated as an experimental event space. \u201cWe want the space to be reflective of the innovative people who live and visit Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd especially this new community that the park resides in\u201d \u2014 Boston\u2019s new innovation district.\n\nJustin Saglio for The Boston Globe\n\nAnna Kaertner at \u201cSwing Time.\u201d\n\nHoweler said he is happy that the MCCA sought to unite Boston\u2019s creative and technology cultures. \u201cBoston has the (Institute of Contemporary Art) and MIT and so many other institutions that are really shaping the world and the space within it in creative new ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such a historic city, but it also has this techy-geeky side that could visually shine through.\u201d\n\nBlending the Lawn\u2019s landscape and atmosphere into \u201cSwing Time\u201d was a pivotal design component, Howeler said. Planning and constructing the piece was a robust process, requiring input from structural engineers, electrical engineers, and computer programmers to prepare it for installation.\n\n\u201cWe bring the whimsical aspect with the technological components of the piece, but that was also the work that was truly meticulous and important to get right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to help create a community here, so those details are the ones that need to shine through.\u201d And in the case of \u201cSwing Time,\u201d those details emit a purple glow.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 In August 2013, transgender television personality B. Scott filed a suit against Black Entertainment Television and its parent company Viacom Inc., claiming that the network had discriminated against him based on his gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from Scott\u2019s appearance as a style correspondent at the 2013 BET awards preshow. After his first segment of the night, in which he appeared with heavy makeup and heels, the network told him to tone down his look and change into masculine clothing that was \u201cdifferent from the androgynous style he\u2019s used to \u2026 and comfortable with,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nA Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided the case Wednesday, and it came down to the First Amendment; not Scott\u2019s freedom to speech and expression, but Viacom\u2019s VIA . The court found that BET\u2019s decision as to how Scott would appear on camera was part of the network\u2019s creative process of developing and broadcasting the show, which is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nMORE: Americans have fallen in love with real estate once again\n\nThe case is by no means the first in which a media company has used the First Amendment as a defense against lawsuits alleging discrimination. The order on Thursday cites several other instances.\n\nThere was the racial discrimination case against ABC for its failure to feature non-white contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. A federal district court in Tennessee dismissed the matter after finding that \u201ccasting decisions are a necessary component of any entertainment show\u2019s creative content.\u201d The court said that \u201cthe plaintiffs seek to drive an artificial wedge between casting decisions and the end product, which itself is indisputably protected as speech by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nAnd there was the lawsuit filed against Warner Bros. by a former writers\u2019 assistant for the television show Friends who asserted that the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language and conduct by the show\u2019s writers constituted sexual harassment. The Supreme Court of California in that case held that \u201cthe First Amendment protects creativity.\u201d\n\nThe case that held greatest precedent is a matter in which a group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual Irish Americans sought to participate in Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. The U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately heard the case, ruled that it would be a violation of the First Amendment for Massachusetts to require private citizens \u201cwho organize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey.\u201d\n\nThe defendants in these cases argued that they didn\u2019t care what their employees or participants are in reality \u2014 gay, straight, male, female \u2014 but rather how they appear. \u201cThey say, \u2018We are entitled to create a program that looks the way we want it to look,\u2019\u201d says Eugene Volokh, a professor at UCLA School of Law. And the courts have agreed with them.\n\nMORE: The market for marketing software is accelerating rapidly\n\nReporting the news and creating a television show both qualify as exercises of free speech, according to Thursday\u2019s ruling in the Scott case. Outside those realms, however, the First Amendment defense against discrimination claims doesn\u2019t work as well. Abercrombie & Fitch anf , for instance, lost a bias suit filed by a Muslim employee that it fired because she refused to remove her head scarf. Abercrombie had argued that any deviation from its dress code threatened the company\u2019s success and that the lawsuit violated its First Amendment right to commercial free speech. A federal judge in California disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment line is really drawn at news and entertainment,\u201d Volokh says. The Supreme Court has found that \u201cpeople who make visual imagery are allowed to control what\u2019s in it.\u201d",

        "text": "BY JOHN H. FENTON; SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMESJUNE 28, 1964\n\nBOSTON, June 27\u2014A Metho\u00addist minister from Boothbay Harbor, Me., has suggested that the John Birch Society may well be \u201con the road to respect\u00adability if its money holds out.\u201d\n\nThe minister is the Rev. Dr. J. Allen Broyles. He said, how\u00adever, that such \u201crespectability\u201d tvas \u201cstill quite a distance clown the street.\u201d In the meantime, he said, others might just as well learn to manage the prob\u00adlem of coexistence with the ul\u00adtra\u2010conservative organization.\n\nThe minister expressed his views in \u201cThe John Birch So\u00adciety; Anatomy of a Protest,\u201d ($4.50), recently published by the Beacon Press. It was a re\u00advision of a doctoral dissertation submitted to the department of sociology and social ethics of the Boston University Graduate School.\n\nIn defining respectability, Dr. Broyles said that Robert H. W. Welch Jr., the founder of the society, had always maintained that his members were made up of \u201creal, solid citizens.\u201d The minister did not interview Mr. Welch in compiling his mate\u00adrial.\n\n\u201cMost of the members I in\u00adterviewed were in the middle or upper\u2010middle class, but most of them were \u2018fringe\u2019 within their communities, due partly, of course, to their outlandish views which are part and par\u00adcel of the ideology of the socie\u00adty,\u201d said Dr. Broyles. \u201cTheir socio\u2010economic status qualified them for \u2018respectability,\u2019 but their politics did not.\u201d\n\nThe minister saw the soci\u00adty's executive council exerting a continuing moderating in\u00adfluence on Mr. Welch. He ex\u00adpected that this would lead to Mr. Welch's views and interests becoming \u201csomewhat more re\u00adstrained and conventional.\u201d\n\nThe Birch Society, Dr. Broy\u00adles contended, would begin a \u201crapid downward spiral\u201d if a\n\nAn Arizona member told the minister that he thought the conservative movement, of which the Birch Society was a part, \u201cis basically a protest by people over the loss of individ\u00aduality.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its purported mission of fighting Communists, the Birch Society also professes to fight \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\nAbout the time Dr. Broyles's book was being displayed in book stores, a report filed with the office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, Edward W. Brooke, showed the society had ended 1963 with a deficit of $210.952.\n\nThe report, required by law, showed gross income of $1,043,\u00ad656 and expenses of $1,169,997 in 1963. There also was a carry\u00adover deficit of $84,612 from 1962.\n\nThe membership of the Birch Society remains a secret. When he organized it, Mr. Welch set a goal of 1 million members. Some estimates have placed the mem\u00adbership at about 100,000 at the most.\n\nTwice in recent years, Mr. Welch has acknowledged that attacks on the society have slowed its growth. But he has vigorously disputed any sug\u00adgestion that the slowing rate indicated a substantial loss of membership.\n\nDr. Broyles found that the average distribution rate of American Opinion, the society's monthly magazine, was 27,000 copies.\n\nDr. Broyles said that most of the society members he in\u2010\n\nSince attempts to reform the society from the outside were \u201cfore\u2010doomed,\u201d Dr. Broyles said. that coexistence with such ex\u00adtremist groups had to be faced. In the process, responsible citi\u00adzens should not let inflamma\u00adtory charges by the extremists go unchallenged. he asserted.\n\nMembers of the Birch Society, saki Dr. Broyles, \u201cdo not spend all their time making accusa\u00adtions against uersons.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them touch upon real issues and problems in many areas of our national life,\u201d he declared, \u201cbut the most that could be said for the great majority of the members and leaders would be that where they are scratching there was an itch, but that their scratch\u00ading was only broadening the inflammation.\u201d\n\nDr. Broyles saidhe had talked with a member of the Birch staff in the Belmont na\u00adtional headquarters about two weeks after President Ken\u00adnedy's assassination. And while there had been no \u201cdropouts\u201d from the society as a result, Dr. Broyles said he found the atmosphere of the place more restrained.\n\nThe staff inembers, said Dr. Broyles, commented that it seemed \u201ca time when people need to speak the truth with prudence.\u201d\n\nCalling for a spirit of ra\u00adtionality, Dr. Broyles com\u00admented:\n\n\u201cIt is sobering to remind our\u00adselves and to remind even the Birchers that, if we do not de\u00adfend freedom and rationality as the norms of political conflict, we ought not to be surprised to find ourselves caught in a to\u00adtalitarianism not only from the left or from the right, but per\u00adhaps even from the center.\u201d\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form.

No, it\u2019s not Richard Linklater\u2019s celebrated \u201cBefore\u201d project, with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy living out the long arc of a relationship, but the much less heralded \u201cHenry Fool\u201d trilogy from Hal Hartley. A major indie auteur in the 1990s, Hartley has been nigh invisible the past decade, but he has kept plugging away in his signature style: attractively mordant characters delivering deadpan seriocomic monologues about philosophy and romance.\n\nWith \u201cNed Rifle,\u201d Hartley brings to a close the family saga begun in his biggest hit, \u201cHenry Fool\u201d (1997), and continued in the fairly bewildering \u201cFay Grim\u201d (2006). The new film is a return to form after that sagging midsection, and the coterie of Hartley admirers still paying attention will find frustrations, rewards, a few darkly intelligent laughs, and an ending that unexpectedly haunts.\n\nAdded bonus: more stuff for Aubrey Plaza to do. As the latest recruit to Hartley-land, the \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d star seems born to the mannerisms, and her way with a fetching glower fits right in. When \u201cNed Rifle\u201d opens, Fay Grim (Parker Posey) is still serving a life sentence on a framed-up terrorism charge (don\u2019t ask), and her 18-year-old son, Ned (Liam Aiken), has emerged from witness protection with a profound belief in God and a burning anger toward Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), the reprobate father he never met. Bidding farewell to his Reverend foster father (Hartley regular Martin Donovan), Ned packs a Bible and a gun and sets out to make amends.\n\nFirst, he has to visit his Uncle Simon (James Urbaniak), the onetime garbage man turned prize-winning poet-reclusive literary legend of \u201cHenry Fool.\u201d Fame is wearing on Simon, who has started a stand-up comedy video blog out of boredom; it\u2019s pretty terrible. Pointing his nephew in the direction of Seattle, he also inadvertently throws Ned together with Susan (Plaza), a possibly unhinged graduate student-stalker whose secrets involving the other characters take most of the movie to surface.\n\nFor all that, you probably don\u2019t need to have seen the first two movies to get on this one\u2019s offbeat road-movie wavelength. Aiken, who was 7 when \u201cHenry Fool\u201d was made, has aged into a lean, charismatic center of stillness, and you want to see Ned come out all right if only to make good on the actor\u2019s two-decade investment. He and Plaza make an arresting team, the child of God and the damaged sexpot, and it\u2019s fascinating (if a little bizarre) to see the actress push her gloomy persona into more erotic territory. \u201cNed Rifle\u201d isn\u2019t Plaza\u2019s break-out role \u2014 that was \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d in 2012 \u2014 but it does indicate that she\u2019s more than the Millennial Eeyore ing\u00e9nue she can be typed as.\n\nThe movie gets a real lift when Ned and Susan finally track down Henry Fool, who\u2019s being held against his will in a pharmacological mental institution after drug experiments have convinced him he\u2019s Satan. (This qualifies as a normal development in a Hal Hartley movie.) As before, Ryan breaks through the glass wall of the film\u2019s style with energetic cynicism; Henry is a Bukowski bad boy whose acid brilliance shines only in person, never on paper.\n\nPosey is in only a handful of scenes, which is fine: Stiff and unconvincing, she seems to have lost interest in her character. Can you blame her? I\u2019m not sure what Hartley\u2019s larger game plan is, other than to explore the way sins ricochet and deepen through a family over the years. The tension in his movies comes from the collision of hot emotions and cool behavior; the filmmaking is deadpan, too, as though Jim Jarmusch had gotten stranded in Middle America.\n\nBut Hartley lacks Jarmusch\u2019s visual invention, not to mention his interest in a world outside his characters. At its worst, \u201cNed Rifle\u201d is a self-involved movie about self-involved people. When it clicks, though, we\u2019re in a pared-down moral universe that carries unsettling echoes of our own.",

Sam\u2019s Club members will get a 20% discount on fees related to the loans, and executives said that discount, coupled with other new services that will soon be introduced, could save members up to $2,300 a year.\n\nThe lending service is one of five new ones the company is offering to better serve its business members, which account for as much as one-third of Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s membership, according to Kantar Retail estimates, but who have proven to be a softer part of its business compared to non-business members of late.

Sam\u2019s Club, which generates about 12% of Wal-Mart\u2019s revenue, had sales of $58 billion last year, enough to be the 8th largest U.S. retailer. But its comparable sales were unchanged last fiscal year, compared to 5% growth at larger rival Costco Wholesale\u2019s COST U.S. stores.\n\nBrewer had told Fortune in November that rather than diminish its exposure to its business members, Sam\u2019s Club planned to redouble its efforts to cater to them.

        "text": "On the outskirts of a busy port city lies a university campus that looks a lot like a scene from the British Midlands. Students in hoodies and headphones wearing thick, rectangle-rimmed glasses discuss \u2018critical thinking\u2019 and on sunny days sit crossed-legged on the grass by a lake as construction dust blows in the wind.\n\nBut some of these students have never liked a Facebook message or sent a friend request. They send tweets on Weibo not Twitter and upload photos on Weixin not Instagram.\n\nWelcome to Ningbo in China, Northern Zhenjiang province, five thousand miles away from the UK.\n\nEvery international business in the world, from textiles to technology, is trying to access the Chinese market. The education business is no different.\n\nNingbo is famous for its entrepreneurs and foreign investment. For the last 10 years it has also been home to Nottingham Ningbo (UNNC) a satellite campus of Nottingham University.\n\nThe campus is a partnership between the University of Nottingham UK and the Wanli Education group, a Chinese state-owned company. Staffed with both Chinese and international academics, it is sold as a genuine UK university experience in China.\n\nThis new fleet of universities is part of China\u2019s big ambition to become a world powerhouse for education \u2013 for students from San Francisco to Shanghai.\n\nForeign institutions are falling over themselves to set up partnerships with Chinese universities - from cooperation projects to creating campuses that mirror their own in Chinese cities. For international universities this provides an opportunity to get a foothold in a country already obsessed with education. And more importantly for the students, for future business leaders in particular, it offers an insight into a marketplace that still proves elusive for international companies.\n\n\"I think being immersed in the country changes your sense of the reality of it, \u201csaid Joseph Healey, a Scottish banker in his early 50s who took a masters degree at UNNC after serving as a senior executive at the National Australia Bank. \u201cI spent over 10 years discussing China with leaders in business [outside of China] and a big part of the problem is that we have a shallow understanding of the complexity of this country. So it is no surprise that so many businesses have failed.\u201d\n\nNew York University, John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and Liverpool University, among others, have all set up campuses in China.\n\nMeanwhile the Chinese government is pouring money in to transforming its education sector: in the last decade alone it quadrupled its number of annual university graduates. The country has also become the world's largest exporter of students, with nearly as many Chinese students studying for postgraduate degrees in England as there are Brits.\n\nIt now ranks 3rd in the world's most popular places for international study, behind only the UK and America, and is expected to attract more than half a million international students by 2020 studying degrees and study abroad programmes, according to the US-based Institute of International Education\u2019s Project Atlas.\n\nBut this huge expansion is not without its problems: there have been concerns over academic integrity at some institutions. In July 2012 Yale cancelled its programme at Peking University. The American Ivy League university allegedly blamed its decision on lower than expected interest in its courses. But its programme also faced controversy. In 2007 a biology professor openly criticised administrators for tolerating alleged widespread plagiarism amongst Chinese students.\n\nInternational campuses like UNNC face a unique set of difficulties. Administrators must try to ensure a high standard of education and academic freedom in a country where politics can interfere in everything. In January, China's education minister vowed to ban university text books that promote 'Western values\u2019, sparking widespread concern in Western educational circles.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Education has promised to provide foreign universities with the same freedoms they enjoy in their home countries. But the institutions must also comply with Chinese rules and regulations which means studying of Marxism is compulsory for Chinese students, for example, but not for international students.\n\nAnd China's strict control of the internet also means that some foreign-based websites such as Google Scholar, a search engine which indexes scholarly literature across formats and topics, is blocked in the country. Researchers must use virtual private networks (VPN) in order to use such services.\n\nThere are other practical difficulties. While seminars are taught in English, many international students find themselves in classes where the majority of their classmates are not native English speakers. And this can create some significant obstacles.\n\n\u201cMostly, Chinese students in class don't participate. Back home when you know you are right you tell the lecturer,\u201d said Ella Appiah a 20-year-old student from Ghana studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree in International Communications at UNNC.\n\nThat might be more a product of cultural norms than any language barriers, said Amir Emamizadeh, a 19-year-old British student at UNNC. \u201cChinese students struggle in group activities as they don't have experience in that at high school,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough to be sure for many of the students the advantages of being immersed in China far outweigh any of the difficulties. Students point out that being part of a rapidly changing society has significant advantages for their studies, in particular case work.\n\n\"As a global health student I feel that I have the advantage of studying in a country that gives me a first-hand experience in global health challenges in the 21st century. We have the chance to have field visits to different parts of China where we experience first-hand important health issues,\" said Kennedy Opondo, a 26-year-old Kenyan studying at the school.\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

Perhaps on the way out of the store, they\u2019ll grab some exotic beans or a fancy package of preground coffee.\n\nUnfortunately, they haven\u2019t done the one thing they need to do to make a truly great cup.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the brewing apparatus isn\u2019t the most important tool\u2014it\u2019s the grinder, usually the weakest link in the coffee chain and the one most deserving of the biggest chunk of your budget.\n\nGrinding the beans right before you use them is the easiest thing you can do to improve the quality of your morning quaff, no matter the brewing method or type of coffee you prefer. According to the National Coffee Association\u2014not to mention anyone who\u2019s ever tried it\u2014this will make coffee taste much fresher than pre-ground, or even beans that you grind the night before. (Buying freshly roasted beans is another good idea.)\n\nBut grinding before brewing only gets you so far. For really superior results, you need the right kind of grinder. Most people settle for an inexpensive spinning-blade grinder, but a \u201cburr\u201d grinder\u2014think of a pepper mill for coffee\u2014is a vastly better choice. Unlike the spinning blade types, which create both fine dust and big chunks, the burrs grind to a uniform size, which makes for an even extraction of flavor compounds and caffeine.\n\nThe evenness of the particle sizes may not seem that important, but it has a significant effect on how your coffee tastes. When particles are small, the hot water quickly extracts the coffee flavor, caffeine, and other compounds and can easily extract too much, giving a bitter taste.\n\nOn the other hand, big, chunky particles make it hard for the hot water to take out the caffeine and flavor, which results in under-extraction and a sour taste. For people using blade grinders, these flavors often come together to create a muddy cup that\u2019s nothing more than an eye-opener.\n\nThe good news here is that a burr grinder has the potential to be a miracle cure for your morning, and will yield tremendous results regardless of the brew method. (Blue Bottle and plenty of other well-regarded coffee companies use Bonmac drippers you can buy for $12.)\n\nElectric models, the kind with genuine conical burrs (they look like this) start at around $90. According to The Sweethome, a popular and respected product review publication, you can get a really good one for $130, as long as you\u2019re not doing espresso grind, which is too fine for most machines to handle. That may seem like a lot to spend for a coffee crusher, but if you amortize the cost over years of coffee-drinking pleasure, the price may not seem so high. (And you can always buy a cheaper coffee machine.)\n\nThere is a budget option, however\u2014if you\u2019re willing to have a small workout. Non-electric burr grinders are a perfect way to get started if you want to see whether upping your grind makes a difference. At just $19, models like the Hario Coffee Mill Slim Grinder do a phenomenal job that rivals many of the electric models 10 times the price. It may take you a couple of minutes of grinding for two cups of coffee, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little exercise in the morning. For less than $20, the downside is small if you can\u2019t tell a difference, but the upside is huge. You may find that it\u2019s no longer just caffeine that wakes you up\u2014it\u2019s the anticipation of a top-notch cup of coffee.",

        "text": "It\u2019s a great time to be in the market for a used car. The Wall Street Journal recently cited data indicating that used-car prices declined for the four consecutive months through August. USA Today noted that the average used car purchased at a franchised auto dealership sold for $10,883 in August, down 1.6% from the previous year and 2.4% versus July 2014. Edmunds.com predicted that used car prices would dip around 2% overall this year, and that some used vehicles\u2014in particular, large crossover SUVs like the Chevy Traverse\u2014would drop in price by upwards of 8%.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the forecast calls for used-car prices to stay on a downward trend for the foreseeable future. AutoTrader.com, the Atlanta-based online marketplace for new and used vehicles, says that its inventory of certified pre-owned vehicles has risen 6% since March, and that by year\u2019s end buyers can expect a handful of top \u201cpre-loved\u201d car models\u2014including the 2011 versions of the Ford Fusion, Toyota Corolla, and Honda CR-V\u2014to be priced at roughly 5% less than what dealers were asking just six months ago.\n\nWhat accounts for the sudden price dip? A quick review of what has happened in the new and used car markets over the past few years sheds some light. In 2011, used vehicle prices hit a 16-year high in the wake of the Great Recession, when relatively few consumers were purchasing or leasing new cars because money was tight and credit was less available. That meant a shrinking supply of used cars, as there were fewer trade-ins or vehicles coming off lease. The \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d stimulus program also removed millions of used vehicles from the market, further tightening supply.\n\nAccording to Cars.com, the average 2012 listing price for five popular used vehicles five or more years old had risen a whopping 29% over the three years prior. Around that time, however, new car leases and sales surged, rising 13% in 2012 and continuing with impressive growth in 2013 and 2014. All of those new vehicle purchases and leases have translated to a parallel rise in trade-ins and cars coming off leases. \u201cLeasing has surged in recent years with thousands of those cars coming back to dealerships as used cars,\u201d Michelle Krebs, AutoTrader.com senior analyst, said via press release. \u201cThe abundance of returned lease cars should result in used cars coming off their historical highs of recent years, representing good buys for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway is that used cars are cheap, at least when compared to the record highs of a few years ago, and that the market for previously owned vehicles should remain attractive to buyers through the near future.\n\nYet this turn of events isn\u2019t all good for consumers. When used car prices tank, so does the value of your trade-in, if you have one. Also, automakers are more likely to offer low-price lease deals when their anticipated resale value is high. The flip side is that when used car prices crater, like they\u2019re doing now, car dealerships must assume that they\u2019ll be forced to sell off-lease vehicles for less money\u2014and therefore they need to make more money from the person leasing the car in the first place. In other words, typical monthly payments for a customer leasing a new car are likely to rise compared to the rates available not long ago.",
        "generated": "The article discusses the current trend of declining prices for used cars in the US, with data from various sources showing a steady decrease in prices over the past few months.The reasons for this trend include an increase in the supply of used cars, particularly from leased vehicles coming back to dealerships, and a surge in new car sales and leases, which has led to a parallel rise in trade-ins and used car prices.",

That\u2019s despite interest rates sitting below 1% and the Fed\u2019s balance sheet remaining more than four times larger than it was before the financial crisis.\n\nDouglas Ramsey, for one, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group called this sort of characterization a \u201cshell game,\u201d in a recent presentation to investors, because it belies other statistics that show just how loose the central bank has been. Sure, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has shrunk modestly this year, and interest rates have risen since the end of the financial crisis. But Ramsey points out that Fed interest rate decisions are not the only factor to look for when determining the degree of accommodation provided. It\u2019s the interaction of the Fed, financial markets, and fiscal policy that really drives the economy.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s solid gains suggest that stocks have finally decoupled from the Fed\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d Ramsey writes. \u201cThe absence of [Fed bond buying to drive down rates] and December\u2019s rate hike doesn\u2019t mean that the stock market liquidity is set to dry up.\u201d He argues that we should also be looking at the growth of the money supply, which has accelerated this year. This growth in the money supply suggests some combination of increased bank lending and consumer willingness to keep their assets in ready-to-use cash. That this is occurring even as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet is evidence that central bank policy may be more accommodative, and potentially inflationary, than some observers believe.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this growth in the money supply is occurring at the same time that government debt is increasing faster again as well. \u201cThus, while Yellen is talking tougher than ever before (which is not so tough at all), policy makers appear to have no intention of imposing a \u2018cold turkey\u2019 end to the stimulus,\u201d Ramsey writes.\n\nThrow Donald Trump into the mix, and we may have a real problem. The president-elect has promised a mix of tax cuts and spending increases that would explode the deficit if enacted and impose inflationary pressures on the U.S. economy. The policies would also boost growth, at least temporarily. Yellen said during her press conference that while some of her fellow members had taken Trump\u2019s policy proposals into account in their predictions of the future path of interest rates, it was just one of many factors that lead a number of the central bank governors to predict that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates three times next year. The majority had only estimated two hikes back in September.\n\nThis dynamic, combined with the fact that wages seem to be on the rise, suggest that inflation could begin climbing faster than the central bank assumes. Another important point to consider is that while the Fed likes to look at the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure, minus expenditures on energy and food, to gauge price increases, other measure of inflation, like the Consumer Price Index, are already showing inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.\n\nThe Fed prefers PCE because it\u2019s a less volatile measure, but that also means that it could be slow in picking up signs of inflation that PCE is missing. And that it, like the Fed, could be behind. The economic outlook depends greatly on how the Trump administration will tax and spend in the New Year, but there is a good chance that Janet Yellen and company will have some catching up to do once those policies are in place.",

Still pouring through every piece of evidence but by far the most difficult pieces to study --- are the images of her dead daughter. A lot of people will ask, how could a mother look at the photographs from an autopsy? I don't recommend it to any, any parent. But why did you? I had to. I became my daughter's investigator. I didn't have a choice. Reporter: And immediately there were clues. The kind she says only a mother would notice. The first, I was very shocked at um, looking at her eyes. Sheena and i, we wore the same mascara, and I knew that we, if you cry with this mascara on, that mascara just clumps up, your eyelashes are all clumped up and, and hers were perfect. Reporter: If sheena took her own life, there were no tears, which experts say is very rare. Her make up untouched. Reporter: Something else only a mom would notice -- that diamond bracelet they fawned over at christmas. Reporter: Kelly says it was on the wrong wrist. It is on her right wrist, and I knew that sheena didn't wear her bracelets on her right wrist. As a matter of fact, that video on christmas, when she got that bracelet, she takes that bracelet out of the box, and shows it, with her right hand and automatically places it on her left wrist. Reporter: The crime scene photos also show both the bathroom and the shower doors left open. Sheena's mother convinced she would never have done that with her babies - her two little dogs right there in the room. She would have made sure that her dogs didn't see her that way. One or both of those doors would have been closed. Reporter: And while that's what a mother noticed from those photos veteran crime reporter lee williams saw something else. There's a photo of sheena in the shower, her feet are caked with sand and debris, yet there's no debris on the white floor, on the shower or on the white floor of the bathroom immediately outside the shower. So her feet were caked in sand and yet there was no sand anywhere in that bathroom? None whatsoever. Other than on her feet. Reporter: For williams, sand on her feet and not on the floor around her, makes it nearly impossible to believe sheena killed herself in that shower. So either sheena was carried in there, post mortem, and hung. Or she somehow levitated into that room. Reporter: Kelly had the reporter on her side, but what she truly needed were some big names, forensic heavyweights. And she got three of them to look at all the evidence. One of them taking 20/20 went back to that very hotel room with her. Reporter: Jan johnson is one of those c-s-i experts who examined the evidence. She's spent more than 40 years studying crime scenes, and she immediately saw red flags. A pillow lying on the floor. I would be interested in what is on that pillow. Reporter: A veteran investigator would rule everything out, asking could that pillow have been used to smother her. You're thinking someone could have used one of these pillows to kill her. Absolutely. Reporter: Most telling the bathroom. Where she says crucial evidence was missed. This is where sheena was found hanging from a dog leash. That's correct. It's attached to the shower head. Clipped at the top. Extending downward. The noose around her neck. Her buttocks eight inches off the ground. She's extended toward the back side of the shower with her legs extended outward. Reporter: She's not suspended in midair. No. Reporter: Her legs are on the bottom of the shower. Flat. Reporter: Wouldn't that give somebody ample opportunity to pull themselves back up? Absolutely. Reporter: She points to her clothes, if she were convulsing she would expect the clothes to ride up the body. She points to the cuffs of her pants down around her feet and january says it looks like she was dragged into the shower. The pants are her-- extended outward. And you would have expected if she had, you know, walked her way down the shower wall and hung herself that the pants would've gone up her legs. I mean, her clothing is perfect. She appeared serene, like she had just fallen asleep. A hanging is a violent act. Towards the end, um, your body fights that, it fights the ligature. It struggles to get air, and there was no evidence of any of that. Her hair was perfectly in place. Yeah. And in fact you described it as tucked right behind her ear the way she typically would. It was like a mannequin that had just been pushed over on its side. I've never seen a hanging like that. Reporter: And one more red flag for jan and that entire team of experts was what they saw in sheena's eyes. When you looked at those images and saw she had popped blood vessels you thought -- she had been strangled. You usually see petechial hemorrhages in a strangulation, you don't often see them in a hanging. Reporter: The hemorrhaging in sheena's eyes they believe is more consistent with a violent struggle, a strangling and then the bombshell conclusion. All three experts weighing in, and in every one of their reports -- three words stood out, \"staged crime scene.\" And that's huge, that means that what was done to sheena was staged to make it appear as a suicide. What I think happened in that room that night is -- I think that she may have been suffocated on the bed and i think that she was dragged into the shower and placed into that leash that was already set up on that shower head.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.",

        "text": "Gowin has often pictured Edith naked, framing the female body as a sculptural form. Photograph: Emmet Gowin, Courtesy Pace/MacGill Gallery, New York\n\n\"She had just finished dancing with someone else, and as she approached me, I didn't think I'd ever seen anyone so alive.\" Photographer Emmet Gowin is remembering the night he met his wife, Edith Morris, in the 60s.\n\nSome of the most striking images he's ever taken \u2013 130 of which are on show in a retrospective at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris \u2013 focus on his wife, his most enduring subject. These \"established Edith as a person, and us as a couple\", he says. \"If you set out to make pictures about love, it can't be done. But you can make pictures, and you can be in love. In that way, people sense the authenticity of what you do.\"\n\nAs soon as the pair married in Danville, Virginia in 1964, he adopted her family \u2013 \"a feminine clan\" \u2013 wholeheartedly, and began photographing their everyday life and gatherings. Back then, art that focused on family was a total anomaly. \"I was asked by a journalist if the work is incestuous,\" Gowin says, mystified. \"Photojournalism was the modality. You were reporting on a broader world,\" he says of the expectations that arose during the Vietnam war period. \"We've got antecedents now \u2026 you can hardly find graduate work where people aren't doing things about their family.\"\n\nTo Gowin, it's never been hard to share intimate moments with Edith and his family. \"What's great is that the picture is already taken before it goes public. It's in secret. The trust that develops from such a habit engenders risk, and you realise you're not as vulnerable as you thought. Once you become comfortable with being more truthful about who you are, the easier it is, the prouder you become. That's the way it unfolded for us.\"\n\nHe has often photographed Edith naked, but her nudity has nothing coy about it; it's a plainspoken, fetish-free approach to the female body. His photographs show many tender nuances of womanhood, coupledom and motherhood, whether Edith is baring her breasts, nuzzling into her son Elijah's neck, spreading her legs with a nightgown lifted above her pelvis, or simply showing the nape of her neck. One particularly soulful portrait, taken in 1983, shows her, unclothed, perched on a windowsill with vines framing her. She looks like a wood nymph, yet human in the folds of her stomach and the dip of her breasts. Gowin's images of his wife manage to combine reverie and reality, veneration and humility.\n\nMoreover, his Edith portfolio is a prismatic look at age. The most recent portrait is from 1999, in which she looks rather severe, with round glasses, crinkled eyes, choppy hair and pursed lips. Similarly composed portraits taken in 1980 and 1994 flank each side in the exhibition, magnificently evoking the grace of ageing.\n\nGowin developed his style under Harry Callahan, at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence in the mid 60s. \"I made 10 times as many images as the other students,\" he says of the early years. \"I destroyed all those negatives except a few. I did it as a reminder that you can't afford to waste time: take it seriously.\" His early photography experience still resonates. \"As a good picture would come, I would never know exactly what I had done. When you did see it, it would strike you as a great surprise \u2013 who did that? How did it happen? Being surprised by your own work makes you both less serious and have serious reverence.\"\n\nIn 1967, he crossed over from student to teacher, taking a post at the Dayton Art Institute. Six years later, he was appointed to teach at Princeton, an establishment he stayed at until his retirement in 2009 (though he admits \"I could never have gotten into Princeton as a student\"). As a teacher, he rhapsodised about creativity so philosophically that, after the first class of every semester, students often had to double-check they were in the photography class they'd signed up for.\n\nIt's easy to imagine why they'd be thrown: over the course of our conversation, Gowin quotes James Joyce, William Blake, Diane Arbus, the Bible, Charles Darwin, Maya Angelou and William Henry Fox Talbot. This is not someone who plows linearly through a curriculum. His life and work have been fed by a perpetual sense of wonder at the world, a quest for beauty and an openness to transcendence. He describes his teaching role with awe: \"Going over ideas that you love, smoothing them out and presenting them to someone new ... to honour the thoughts you had yesterday tomorrow is a kind of refinement that brings you dignity. It gives you endurance and dedication.\"\n\nGowin's work, in the exhibition and more generally, can be cleaved into two periods. The family moments in his Virginia hometown peter out, and give way to sprawling global landscapes. It feels like a brusque change of scope. Gowin photographed landscapes, on the ground and aerially, from the early 1970s onwards. He travelled to the ancient Italian town of Matera, the archaeological site of Petra in Jordan, and spent several years chronicling the scarred topography of the American West.\n\nHe realises it disappointed fans when his family portraiture fell by the wayside, but he is unrepentant: \"The world is larger and more complex than that. You change as much as the world around you changes.\" Further, he says: \"The authentic thing is to follow your heart, your instincts, your emotions. If you located yourself in an idea, your life would be lived very sadly.\"\n\nIn the past few years, Gowin has made multiple trips to the tropics, studying devastated land and photographing nocturnal moths. On these expeditions, he travelled with a cut-out silhouette of Edith on trips she couldn't attend. \"It was extremely comforting to have her along. I got as interested in that as the insect pictures I was trying to take.\" His insect series incorporates Edith's silhouette, so while they may be a long way from his raw black-and-white snaps in Danville, the affection for his subject is just as heartfelt.",

        "text": "Digital scrapbooking site Pinterest is stepping into the spotlight in a big way. In recent months, the company has drawn attention through large funding efforts, high-level hires, and international expansion, but still has yet to reveal a proper revenue strategy. But the startup\u2019s recent actions signal not only that it is serious about growing its already impressive audience but also tackling that thorny monetization issue.\n\nPinterest raised $225 million in October, valuing the company at $3.8 billion. In September, Pinterest also launched an experimental (i.e. non-revenue generating) version of its \u201cpromoted pins\u201d campaign. Promoted pins will eventually advertise brands by incorporating company-sponsored pins \u2014 images that display crafts, fashion, recipes, etc. \u2013into the regular content that appears on a user\u2019s home page. This is Pinterest\u2019s second attempt at monetizing its content after an experiment in 2012 with affiliate link software Skimlinks. Then, users were upset by the lack of transparency in the affiliate links system. This time, Pinterest has plans to label more clearly which areas of the site are revenue-generating.\n\nMORE: More Americans are ditching their passports\n\nAs of Thursday, Pinterest also made available some of its real-time data software to developers who work for e-commerce sites. These tools will allow those sites\u2019 marketers to know which of their products\u2019 pins are trending, and they can use that data to display their popular pins to their customers on the partner\u2019s own site. So far, partners include such big names as Disney DIS , Random House , Target TGT , Nestl\u00e9, Wal-Mart WMT , and Zappos. Pinterest spokeswoman Malorie Lucich said in an email that one benefit of these partnerships is a seamless user experience on the sites. \u201cWhile you\u2019re browsing, you can pin directly from the site, so there\u2019s no need to interrupt your shopping, reading, or browsing.\u201d Pinterest is giving these tools away free to developers, but Pinterest\u2019s Steve Patrizi, head of partner marketing, told the Wall Street Journal that for users, this move is \u201cgood exposure \u2026 to see what Pinterest does.\u201d\n\nBuilding partnerships seems to be a current theme of Pinterest\u2019s. On Nov. 6, Pinterest announced that Joanne Bradford, San Francisco Chronicle president and overseer of its digital and marketing efforts, will join as head of partnerships. In her new position, she will be a liaison between Pinterest and advertisers, forging \u201cboth commercial and content partnerships globally.\u201d According to a statement from the Chronicle, Bradford already has plans to work closely with its parent company, Hearst Corp., to develop a content relationship between it and Pinterest. As head of partnerships, she\u2019ll lead Pinterest\u2019s sales team once the company starts selling advertising. She held previous positions in marketing and sales at Yahoo! YHOO , Demand Media DMD , and Microsoft MSFT , so her skill set will be useful in helping Pinterest break into more established digital revenue channels.\n\nMORE: Money manager arrested for defrauding hockey players of $15M\n\nOn the same day that Pinterest announced Bradford\u2019s new position, the company\u2019s CEO Ben Silbermann said at Fast Company\u2019s \u201cInnovation Uncensored\u201d conference that going public is \u201cnot the goal\u201d of Pinterest at this time. With more than 70 million users worldwide (current international markets include the U.K., France, Italy, and, most recently, Japan), the potential for advertising revenue is vast. Pinterest is following in the footsteps of companies like Twitter TWTR and Facebook FB by starting out with experimental revenue methods and building a strong team of executives. In 2007, Facebook had around 70 million users and made around $150 million in revenue. The following year, revenue increased to around $280 million. In 2010,Twitter had around 70 million users and made $28 million in revenue. In 2011, that number became $140 million.

He is now in Russia evading charges of theft of government property and of violating the Espionage Act.\n\nThe discussion, titled \u201cInstitutional corruption and the NSA,\u201d covered politics and policy, privacy, and the public\u2019s right to knowledge deemed secret by government agencies.\n\nSnowden started by saying that there are many \u201cdifficult questions that don\u2019t really have proper answers\u201d but that he would do his best to give clarity to the major issues revolving around his decision to become a government whistle-blower.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been struck by the number of people who have no clear sense of who you are,\u201d Lessig said, \u201cand what your values are as you came to work for the NSA, and the work you did by exposing the NSA.\u201d\n\nSnowden said he comes from a government family, who believed that \u201cfundamentally the government had noble aims and that it did good things.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cBut what I was not aware of and have grown aware of, while the people in government largely are there for the right reasons, there is a culture that pervades the upper levels, the senior levels that has become less accountable to the public they serve,\u201d Snowden said.\n\nThis realization, Snowden said, led him to uncover that a massive amount of surveillance was being done on Americans, surveillance that he said should have never happened.\n\n\u201cThey were happening beyond any possible statute for recording, based on the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that there were no reasons for much of the surveillance to exist and that very few people, including members of Congress and many of his co-workers, knew about the program.\n\nSnowden said he believed whistle-blowers are people who are standing up for something, in this case democratic right of free speech and privacy. But he emphasized that they should not dictate how the information is dispersed to the public.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to not dictating outcomes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut allowing the public a chance to participate in democratic processes.\u201d\n\nOne point Snowden emphasized was that he believed the United States has changed from focusing on the traditional way it did surveillance to mass surveillance but that it hasn\u2019t made the process any more effective. He argued that, in fact, spying is less successful.\n\n\u201cThis is the real challenge between what happened before and what\u2019s happening now in surveillance,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to collect information on everyone, and it\u2019s never been necessary.\u201d\n\nHe said the approach of massive surveillance, of listening to phone networks and hacking into websites, is actually making the United States more vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\u201cOnce you make a backdoor into something,\u201d Snowden said, \u201cyou can\u2019t control who walks in through it.\u201d",

But rarely is there a long line to leave a room.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened this afternoon, during a keynote interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nFor the past two years, the SXSW Interactive festival has been evolving its reputation as more than a place for big social media apps to \u201cbreak out.\u201d Last year, the festival focused on nerdier tech and science themes like 3D printing and space exploration. This year, there is an emphasis on politics and privacy, with keynotes from Assange and Edward Snowden.\n\nMORE: Will Ben Horowitz be launching his rap career at SXSW?\n\nThe controversial and outspoken anti-censorship advocate drew a crowd of approximately 5,000, packing almost every seat in auditorium. The problem? He wasn\u2019t actually there in person. (He has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012; the British government has been seeking to extradite him for a year.) Assange connected to Austin via Skype, and there were technical glitches. On first ring he didn\u2019t answer.\n\nAfter a rocky logistical start, the interview began slowly, with softball questions like, \u201cHow did you start Wikileaks?\u201d Despite that, Assange managed to offer a few choice Tweet-able sound bytes, such as:\n\n\u201cThere has been a militarization of our civil space, an occupation of our civilian space.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way to achieve justice is to expose injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a fool has no fear. Courage is seeing fear and still proceeding anyway.\u201d\n\nBut generally, the interview consisted of Assange embarking on detailed, elaborate, slowly drawn out answers which do not translate to an engaging Q&A. Making matters worse, opening up to audience answers awkwardly included two moderators \u2014 one from Skype and one from the stage \u2014 who often spoke on top of one another. Most of the audience questions didn\u2019t even come from the audience in the room \u2014 they came from Twitter. It felt more like watching a TV interview than attending an event.\n\nMORE: Ev Williams announces Medium for mobile\n\nThe audience grew restless and began pouring out of the room. That\u2019s (unfortunately) when Assange delivered one of his most inspirational answers for a South by Southwest audience of founders, hackers, and activists, encouraging them to follow in his footsteps.\n\nIn telling his story of fighting the British government, he said, \u201cI hope that gives people courage, that in fact, with a bit of help from your friends, and with some clear thinking and a lot of dedication, you can come to a position where you can stand up against these awful \u2026 great powers. You can outmaneuver then. You can do it.\u201d\n\nThe auditorium was half-empty by then.\n\nIt was a coupe for SXSW to snag an appearance from Assange, who does not frequently agree to interviews. Unfortunately, the Assange session made it clear that live, in-person guests trump remote appearances. SXSW\u2019s other big keynote speech, with Edward Snowden, will also take place via Skype. He\u2019ll be interviewed by Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, on Monday at 11 a.m. Central Time, from Russia, which granted him a year-long temporary asylum in August.",

Fortune periodically turns the spotlight on a different conference attendee to offer their personal insight into business, tech, and entrepreneurship.\n\n1. What is the best advice you ever received?\n\n\u201cJust keep pushing.\u201d In short, it pays to be persistent. Life always presents challenges on many fronts, and focusing where you want to go can keep you stable when your world around you is spinning.\n\n2. What was the last book you read?\n\nQuiet by Susan Cain. Found it both helpful for areas that I struggle with personally, as well as to help me have more empathy.\n\n3. What would you say to a group of young people looking to enter the tough job market?\n\nFocus on just doing not talking. In the end, what matters are your core skills and how you communicate them to others. Go build things that help you in life \u2014 whether interacting with friends, family and/or co-workers.\n\n4. What was your biggest missed opportunity?\n\nMy biggest missed opportunity was also the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.

How do you get your news?\n\nI primarily listen to folks that I have the privilege to meet with, the folks I follow on Twitter, and I read, in particular, academic journals, blogs, and the paper version of several periodicals. And then I contemplate while running and swimming.\n\n6. What was the most important thing you learned in school?\n\nThe importance of intense focus. The ability to shut out external \u201cnoise\u201d and apply your mind to one problem/thought is incredibly powerful. Frankly, I am finding this increasingly difficult to do in our attention economy.\n\n7. If you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be?\n\nPatagonia, Argentina.

She succeeds John P. Bilbrey, who in October had announced his intention to retire from the candy maker in 2017. The maker of the namesake chocolate, Reese's, and Twizzlers said that compensation arrangements for both Buck and Bilbrey\u2014who will continue as non-executive chairman of the board\u2014hasn't yet been determined.\n\nSince joining Hershey in 2005, Buck has steered a few notable strategies including the acquisitions of Krave beef jerky and healthy chocolate brand barkThins. She also spearheaded the company's growing core confection portfolio. Buck, who is 55, was picked to serve as CEO after Hershey said it reviewed both internal and external candidates as it mulled the succession.\n\nLike many of the nation's largest food and beverage manufacturers, Hershey has faced some sales challenges as it confronts changing consumer preferences that include a move away from big established brands in favor of upstart rivals\u2014a trend that has led to some deal-making like the acquisitions Hershey has been involved in. Still, sales growth remains a challenge for most. Hershey's sales slipped in 2015 to $7.39 billion from $7.42 billion the prior year. Hershey is predicting a slim increase of just around 1% for 2016.\n\nHershey even found itself the takeover target of snacking giant Mondelez (mdlz), a deal that died earlier this year after Mondelez said it realized that there was no path forward toward an agreement. The potential $23 billion hostile takeover effort was stonewalled by the Milton Hershey Trust, which controls 80% of shareholder votes at Hershey. Buck will now be responsible for leading Hershey into the future as a stand-alone company.\n\nThe appointment of Buck is notable for a few reasons. With Hershey's $7.4 billion in annual revenue, she will become one of just 25 women to run a Fortune 500 company. Hershey ranked #362 on the most recent list. Her appointment also adds another women to the growing list of female executives that steer Big Food companies.

        "text": "t first glance, it may seem a long shot in an era of orange alerts and stepped-up border patrols. But quietly and carefully, elected officials, labor unions and community groups are starting to push the notion of allowing legal immigrants who are not United States citizens to vote in New York City elections.\n\nSupporters say it is not an outlandish proposition. They point out that even without citizenship, legal immigrants pay taxes, send their children to public schools and serve in the military. Noncitizens in many states were allowed to vote in local, state and even Congressional elections as recently as the 1920's. Until New York City moved to abolish its school boards two years ago, all residents had the right to vote for and serve on them. And although a proposal to open city elections to immigrants was raised 10 years ago without success, some people believe that the time may now be right.\n\nIn the last decade, five towns in Maryland have allowed noncitizens, even illegal immigrants, to vote in local elections. Campaigns for immigrant voting rights are under way in several cities, including Hartford; Cambridge, Mass.; and Washington, where Mayor Anthony Williams has said he supports giving legal immigrants the vote in District of Columbia elections.\n\nThose initiatives may be taken more seriously in a campaign season when politicians in both major parties are making overtures to immigrants, as President Bush has with his proposal to grant temporary legal status to millions now living here illegally.\n\nFor the moment, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has declined to express an opinion on the subject, and Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said this week that he was still studying the legal issues. Several union locals have quietly indicated their support, though only one has formally joined the coalition that is promoting the idea.\n\nAt a minimum, it is an intriguing prospect in a city with about a million legal immigrants of voting age who are not citizens \u0097 equivalent to more than a fifth of the total number of current voters. Granting those people, most of them Hispanic or Asian, the right to vote could change the electoral calculus in a number of arenas, from the races for mayor and the five borough presidents to ballot questions on city borrowing and building projects.\n\nThe new voters would be more likely to elect minority candidates, political analysts say, and could force politicians to become more responsive to issues like deportation policy and immigrant access to health care. If voting rights were extended to the state level \u0097 truly a long shot at this point \u0097 the effects would be even greater, forcing redistricting that could affect the balance of power in Congress. Although all residents are counted when district lines are redrawn, normally only eligible voters are included when the new districts are challenged in court under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"This would be seismic in its impact,\" said Roberto Ramirez, a political consultant and lawyer who has served as a state assemblyman and chairman of the Bronx Democratic Party. \"Both parties would have to develop a different mindset to address policy issues for those residents who have historically not been part of the political process.\"\n\nNationally, there are more than 10 million legal immigrants who are not citizens, according to estimates based on census figures. Some are waiting to become citizens, a process that often takes as long as 10 years with the current backlog of applications. Others are not eligible for citizenship because they are here on temporary visas, or have simply not applied.\n\nIn New York City, the latest proposals are still being drafted by two council members, Bill Perkins and John C. Liu. Supporters all agree that whatever measure surfaces, it should extend the vote to legal immigrants who are eligible to become citizens. Some would prefer a broader law to include anyone who pays taxes, regardless of immigration status.\n\nThere will certainly be opponents. Critics say that giving newcomers the right to vote would undermine the very idea of citizenship.",

        "text": "It began as an attempt to restore one blurry image that had been hidden for a century behind a large built-in wardrobe on William Morris's bedroom wall.\n\nMonths later, the painstaking removal of layers of paint and wallpaper revealed that an entire wall at the artist and craftsman's first married home was painted by his young friends who would become world famous pre-Raphaelite artists.\n\nThe near life size figures on the wall at the Red House, now buried in south east London suburbia at Bexleyheath, are now believed to represent the joint work of Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, his wife Elizabeth Siddal, Ford Madox Brown, as well as Morris.\n\n\"In the morning we had one and a half murky figures, in the evening we had an entire wall covered in a pre-Raphaelite painting of international importance,\" James Breslin, property manager at the Red House, said.\n\n\"We had no idea what the figures, or the newly revealed inscriptions, represented, but at the Red House it pretty much has to be Chaucer, Arthurian myth or the Bible \u2013 all fairly daunting works to start reading line by line,\" Breslin added.\n\nThe property managers decided to tweet an appeal for people to help identify the text, and, Breslin said, that within an hour a tweet came back saying \"Try Genesis 30:6\", which reads \"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son\".\n\nThe figures are from the Bible, including Rachel, Noah holding a model ark, Adam and Eve, and Jacob with his ladder \u2013 the latter possibly by Morris himself \u2013 painted as if on a tapestry furled across the wall.\n\nHowever the imagery is more complex, because scholars believe it also relates to another cherished pre-Raphaelite Arthurian legend, Sir Degrevaunt who married his mortal enemy's daughter. But then neither family thought much of Morris's choice of Janey Burden, the beautiful daughter of an Oxford stable man.\n\nThe mural is also a significant discovery for the National Trust. Ten years ago the National Trust bought the redbrick house studded with romantic details including turrets, stained glass, window seats, a miniature minstrels' gallery and a well, and opened it to the public for the first time.\n\nWhen built, the property was commissioned by Morris in 1860 from the young left wing architect Philip Webb, as a home for his new wife Burden and anticipated large family, it stood among Kent apple orchards. After Morris's day, it passed through a string of private hands and lost almost all the beautiful furnishings designed for it.\n\nNevertheless it has produced a string of surprises, including traces of wall and ceiling paintings in almost every room. \"Basically every white surface in the house is suspect \u2013 there will be colour underneath it,\" Breslin said. \"Why have three clashing patterns when you can have six, seems to have been their motto.\"\n\nIn the drawing room, intended by Morris to be \"the most beautiful room in the world\", panelling was removed to reveal paintings by Burne Jones and probably Rossetti, and some by Morris including roses on a blue background which may be his first attempt at a repeat flower pattern.\n\nSuch patterns, manufactured by his company, would by the end of the century cover half the middle class walls and sofas of England. In one painting a dog curled up under a chair has turned out to be a wombat, and therefore almost certainly Rossetti's work: he was bizarrely obsessed with the animals, and once owned one as a pet \u2013 it died after reputedly eating a box of cigars.\n\nIn the bedroom the discovery almost doubled the cost of the conservation work, to \u00a3110,000. Fragments showing up on the ceiling and the other walls \u2013 partly covered by a particularly horrible 1960s version of Morris's classic willow boughs design, whose owner could never have guessed they were burying a genuine piece by the master \u2013 suggest there is much more work to come.\n\nBreslin points out that Morris at Red House was far from \"the tub thumping grey bearded socialist\" of later years. They were all young, and it was a party house, devoted to games of hide and seek, music, silly practical jokes and food fights in the drawing room.\n\nGeorgie Burne Jones recalled that they once stitched the back of Morris's waistcoat so the buttons wouldn't do up, causing him to agonise over growing fat.\n\nThe idyll under the apple trees barely lasted five years. Burne Jones' month old son died of scarlet fever which almost killed his mother, and Lizzie Siddall died of an overdose. Morris, exhausted by the long commute into London, the lovely house half mortgaged to his mother, sold up. His Guenevere, Janey, went on to have an affair with his best friend Rossetti which almost broke his heart.\n\n\"So much of the work was never finished because they were young and they thought they had all the time in the world,\" Breslin said. \"As it turned out, they hadn't.\"",

Or maybe yesterday, I don't know \u2026\" Sugimoto writes, on the many handwritten notes that double as captions as we make our way round. Echoing the beginning of Albert Camus's 1942 novel The Stranger, which begins with almost the same words (\"Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday \u2026\"), the phrase keeps recurring, leitmotif and chorus. Swapping \"mother\" with \"world\" implies a final, universal end of fertility and the breaking of the primal bond. It's also fun.\n\nImagining the end of the world is a great creative conceit and has its own perverse fertility. The end is always with us \u2013 end of the novel, death of the author, death of painting, no more bees (in one section of the show, the beekeeper has hung up his clobber and the hive is empty). No more people, end of the world. The end.\n\n\"Imagining the worst conceivable tomorrows gives me tremendous pleasure at the artistic level,\" says Sugimoto. \"The darkness of the future lights up my present.\"\n\nHe is best known for his bleak, empty and sometimes beautiful black-and-white photographs, and his remarks make me peer into his images more intently, looking for signs and tremors. This is an unexpected show from an artist associated with images of horizons, iceflows, collections of Buddhas and empty cinemas whose screens are filled with glowing blank voids (for these, Sugimoto left the shutter open for the duration of the projected film, recording only a luminous, numinous blank).\n\nOnly a small number of Sugimoto's own photographs are included here. Instead, he presents us with scenes of apocalyptic, whimpering, cataclysmic and drawn-out finality. A 13th-century carved sculpture of Kaminari-sama, the Shinto god of thunder, stands atop a stone staircase, rescued from a ruined house and leering maniacally. On the wall opposite, ancient fossils sit in cabinets. Sugimoto sees these little cabinets as incubators. Maybe they're waiting for a flash of galvanising lightning to bring them back to life.\n\nSugimoto provides his own, using a hidden Faraday cage to create indoor lightning, and displaying camera-less photographs whose images are produced using electromagnetic charges. (He is only following Fox Talbot, the pioneer of early photography who used the same technique.) Artificial weather and lifelike artifice are part of Sugimoto's theme.\n\nHis captions are as fanciful as they are informative, and not always easy to read. A guidebook would have been more helpful. Near a collection of Barbie dolls, one note claims: \"I wanted to be a Barbie when I grew up.\" Cosmetic surgery made this possible. \"Genes went haywire and made seedless melons out of everyone,\" the caption notes.\n\nAll this leads, we later discover, to the creation of a race of hermaphrodites. Futuristic gender trouble is a favourite sci-fi ploy. Beneath a 1750s engraving of hermaphroditic genitalia, by the French anatomist and artist Jacques Fabien Gautier d'Agoty, Sugimoto places a lifesize supine figure in a gorgeous, 16th-century geometric Noh play costume, with an equally old, androgynous Kassiki mask for a face. The figure's head sits under a glass dome. It is a wonderful and erotic thing, with arms outstretched like an immobilised angel. Beneath the clothes, the figure is bound like an Egyptian mummy.\n\nIf it weren't for the quality of the exhibits in Sugimoto's wunderkammer, most of which come from his own collection, all this could be tiresome, teetering into kitsch. Instead it is a treasure trove of the marvellous, frightful and bizarre. It is also an extremely dense exhibition, full of odd things you don't notice first time round. Real space-programme vessels for astronauts' pee and poo, an enormous stone phallus on a gurney, odd confabulations that refer to the works of Marcel Duchamp and Warhol. One display includes a greenish-brown lead-glass sphere, which was made as a window to inspect the reactions in making a \"Nagasaki-type\" atomic bomb in America's Manhattan Project. The timing device of a second world war Japanese torpedo, a map of Iwojima and a macabre US military \"Jap Hunting License ('Open Season \u2013 No Limit')\" occupy the same display, while round the corner another strange gas-masked figure lies rigid on a stretcher.\n\nAll this does not prepare one for Sugimoto's remaking of Duchamp's \u00c9tant donn\u00e9s, the work Duchamp made in secret over the last 20 years of his life. The elements of Duchamp's work have been replaced \u2013 with a hyper-real sex doll, made by a Japanese company, on a couch, a gas lamp on the stool beside her, and a photographic backdrop of a rainforest by Sugimoto. The accompanying sound of a waterfall is reproduced by computer-generated white noise. It feels so alive, so real, so fake, so dead. Like life but not life, it has little of the mystery and none of the voyeurism of Duchamp's original.\n\nBut I swear the thunder was real on my visit, even though it felt laid on. So, too, was the rain through the skylight. In the distance, at the end of a corridor, hangs one of Sugimoto's seascapes. Black sea, grey sky; it is an image of an unpeopled, indifferent world. It warms the heart.\n\n\u2022 Aujourd'hui le monde est mort (Lost Human Genetic Archive) is at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 7 September.",

        "text": "In a new study published in JAMA Surgery, researchers say that 70% of women with breast cancer in one breast who decide to remove the other breast do so unnecessarily. In fact, only 10% of women diagnosed with breast cancer should consider such prophylactic mastectomy, say experts.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t kept rates of mastectomies from climbing. In the 1990s, about 1% of women diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast opted to have the other one removed; that percentage has jumped to 20% in recent years.\n\nMORE: Angelina Jolie\u2019s Double Mastectomy: It\u2019s Not the Only Option\n\nThis increase is despite the fact that studies don\u2019t show that removing an unaffected breast can lower a woman\u2019s risk of recurrence or increase her chances of surviving the disease. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that there are other reasons\u2014perfectly understandable and deeply human ones\u2014that may be guiding women\u2019s choices. We spoke with leading experts and identified these four.\n\n1. A fear of doing nothing\n\n\u201cFear is absolutely driving the decision,\u201d says Dr. Isabelle Bedrosian of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cI definitely understand that fear; we often hear, \u2018I don\u2019t want to deal with this ever again.\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s reasonable, especially for women who go through the rigors of chemotherapy, and who are worried about surviving their disease so they can be there for their children and their families.\n\nThat fear, however, can overshadow reason. Bedrosian was not involved in the current study, but published a trial in 2010 in which she and her colleagues found that only a small and specific group of women diagnosed with breast cancer\u2014those under age 50, with early stage disease that was negative for estrogen receptors\u2014may benefit from having both breasts removed. These women enjoyed a nearly 5% improved chance of survival five years after diagnosis than those who did not have the unaffected breast removed. But as the current study found, this represented less than 10% of women with breast cancer.\n\nStudies also show that the chances of breast cancer recurring in the opposite breast are very, very small. In fact, breast cancer patients are more likely to develop recurrent tumors in other parts of the body\u2014the liver, lungs, or the brain\u2014than they are their other breast. Still, says Hawley, \u201cThere are probably other things caught up in the variable of worry, from not wanting to think about [cancer] anymore, to not wanting to regret anything in the future if something did happen.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: MRI: A New Tool to Detect Recurrent Breast Cancer\n\n2. Early detection means too much information\n\nTechnology may also play a role in driving up rates of just-in-case surgery. More women are getting an MRI of the breast, both as a way to screen for breast cancer and to give doctors a better picture of the tumors. These images are refined enough to pick up the tiniest of lesions, including those that may not need treatment. But it\u2019s hard for women to do nothing at all after learning they have a growth in their breast, even if they might be benign and not require treatment. In such moments, it\u2019s likely that every instinct tells women to do something. \u201cThe feeling is to do everything possible, and doing everything possible means more surgery,\u201d says Hawley.\n\n3. The pink ribbon brigade\n\nBreast cancer advocacy is a model of how to mobilize and educate the public about a disease. Rates of screening have gone up while death rates have come down (although it is still the leading cancer killer among U.S. women). The awareness about the disease and the push for better treatments, however, have magnified the obligation and responsibility behind every choice, from screening to diagnosis and treatment. And that\u2019s especially true about the decision surrounding prophylactic surgery. \u201cThere is a hyper awareness surrounding prophylactic mastectomy, and many women are choosing it without a clear understanding of why,\u201d says Bedrosian.\n\nCoverage of celebrities\u2019 decisions to proactively remove their breasts may also heighten the urgency of taking aggressive action for many women. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone publicly who has said they were diagnosed with breast cancer recently and chose to have lumpectomy with radiation,\u201d says Hawley. (Good Morning American anchor Amy Robach, who does not carry the BRCA breast cancer genes which put women at higher risk of recurrence, still decided to have a double mastectomy.) \u201cThere is a feeling that doing everything you can is a way to take control. And just doing a lumpectomy and radiation may not be taking as much control as choosing a double mastectomy.\u201d\n\nMORE: Study: Double Mastectomy May Not Improve Survival\n\n4. Not enough accurate information about options\n\nBedrosian admits that part of the reason women are choosing to proactively remove their breasts, even when they may not need to, has to do with the fact that doctors don\u2019t have the best tools for helping patients make this decision. For the 10% of women at high risk of having recurrent breast cancer, the decision isn\u2019t as challenging. But for the remaining 90%, many of whom may not have a genetic risk but have distant relatives with the disease, the decision becomes harder. \u201cCommunication is important to make sure that patients are informed about the medical facts,\u201d says Bedrosian. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make sure that our patients are making informed choices and not simply fear-driven choices.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a very personal\u2014and complicated\u2014decision, in which each of these factors, and many others, may take on varying degrees of importance.",

We boomers grew accustomed to the notion, forged over decades, that we drove the zeitgeist of our times. No more. Millennials rule.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true in the workplace (see our coverage of the 100 Best Companies to Work For). Any discussion of talent quickly devolves into a dissection of the millennial mind. Managers struggle with preconceptions. Must millennials change jobs every two years? Do they require constant reinforcement, after a childhood of \u201ceverybody\u2019s a winner\u201d? Do they need a \u201cchill\u201d workplace? Free food? Foosball?\n\nMany of the popular notions are pure myth. Some busted ones:\n\nMillennials want to change jobs frequently.\n\nWrong. A study by my former colleagues at the Pew Research Center shows that millennials actually value job security more highly than boomers do. But they won\u2019t stay at a job they don\u2019t like. Some 50% of millennials say having a \u201cjob you enjoy\u201d is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them, compared with just 38% of boomers.\n\nMaybe. The Pew study found that millennials put \u201ca high-paying job\u201d near the bottom of their list of work priorities\u2014but so do other generations, in roughly equal numbers. Count me a skeptic on all counts. What people say when surveyed over the phone and how they act when an offer is on the table are different things.\n\nEvery Millennial wants to be an entrepreneur.\n\nThey may all want to be Mark Zuckerberg, but it\u2019s not happening. A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Reserve data shows the share of people under age 30 who own private businesses has hit a 24-year low\u2014just 3.6%, down from 10.6% in 1989.\n\nStill, there is no doubt that this generation is different. It is the most diverse in American history\u201443% nonwhite\u2014and more confident about the nation\u2019s future than older generations. That\u2019s a reverse from the 1970s, when young boomers were considerably less optimistic than their elders. Millennials also are slower to get married than earlier generations and less likely to belong to a political party\u2014which may make their employer, by default, the most important institutional affiliation in their lives.\n\nThe biggest difference is not who they are, but how they live. They are the ones most comfortable with the new human appendage\u2014the smartphone\u2014that lets them stay connected to a vast network of friends and provides instant access to information, both good and bad. They are quickest to adapt to the ways in which the mobile Internet is changing the fundamental logistics of their lives, and the first to demand the workplace do the same.\n\nSo pay attention. The millennials aren\u2019t spoiled products of a coddled past. They are harbingers of our connected future.\n\nWe had some fun developing cover look for this issue. The full-size versions are in the magazine. Let us know what you think.\n\nThis story is from the March 15, 2015 issue of Fortune.",

Celluride appears to no longer be in operation, though the company is named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with Halpern.\n\nThe lawsuit filed against Uber in claims that Halpern began meeting with Kalanick \u2014 whom the complaint describes as \u201can approachable fellow entrepreneur\u201d \u2014 in 2006 and later shared detailed information about the ongoing development of Celluride with the future Uber co-founder. Halpern alleges that these discussions were held under the guise of confidentiality. Halpern worked until 2008 to develop the technology for Celluride, which, the lawsuit says, is similar to Uber\u2019s business and app interface. Halpern claims Kalanick and fellow Uber co-founder Garrett Camp then stole his trade secrets and presented them as their own at a venture capital conference in the fall of 2008, which was months before the launch of Uber.\n\nUber said Thursday that Halpern\u2019s lawsuit has no merit. \u201cThese claims are completely baseless. We will vigorously defend against them,\u201d Uber spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said in a statement.\n\nHalpern is accusing Kalanick and Camp, along with a handful of venture capital firms that back Uber, of misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion (illegally using someone else\u2019s idea) and breach of contract. The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages. An attorney for Halpern did not immediately respond to Fortune when asked why the lawsuit was not filed until this week, more than six years after Uber\u2019s founding. (Halpern\u2019s attorney announced the lawsuit in a taped press conference.)\n\nIn 2009, Halpern sued Anu Shukla, the founder of tech company Offerpal Media (now called Tapjoy), for breach of contract in a similar lawsuit that alleged Halpern helped create Offerpal only to be cut out of the company shortly before it was founded. That lawsuit was later dismissed, as was another one filed against two Santa Cruz police officers who arrested him for being under the influence of an illegal stimulant.\n\nOf course, Uber is no stranger to legal action itself. The ride-sharing service has faced lawsuits from taxi companies as well as charges brought by passengers and former Uber drivers.\n\nSuccessful tech companies are often the targets of lawsuits by people claiming to behind the original idea. Facebook, for example, was sued by the Winklevoss brothers, who attended Harvard with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The brothers, who claimed Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social network, eventually won a settlement. In another lawsuit against Facebook, Paul Ceglia claimed to have a contract showing that Zuckerberg had promised him half of the company. Ceglia has since reportedly gone missing after being accused in federal court of fabricating the evidence.\n\nFor more about Uber, watch this Fortune video:",

        "text": "Federal regulators on Thursday approved a new injectable drug that promises to sharply reduce levels of bad cholesterol in millions of people who need more than common statins but is also likely to spark another round of debate over the high prices of new medicines.\n\nThe drug, Repatha, developed by Amgen Inc., will be made in West Greenwich, R.I. It\u2019s part of a new class of powerful but expensive medicines that block a protein called PCSK9 from degrading receptors that remove bad LDL cholesterol from the blood.\n\nThe first similar drug, approved by regulators last month, hit the market at a price of $14,600 per year. Insurers had hoped more competition would lower the cost of such treatments. But any immediate relief will be modest. Amgen said it plans to charge $14,100 per year for Repatha.\n\nMore than 73 million Americans have high levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 15 percent, those who don\u2019t respond to or are only partly helped by inexpensive and widely prescribed statins, are candidates for Repatha. But that is a huge market for Amgen, the largest US biotech by market value.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Repatha as a second-line therapy for patients with heart conditions who already take statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cRepatha provides another treatment option in this new class of drugs for patients with [hereditary high cholesterol] or with known cardiovascular disease who have not been able to lower their LDL cholesterol enough with statins,\u201d Dr. John Jenkins, head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said.\n\nWhile considered highly effective, the new PCSK9 inhibitors were immediately scrutinized by health insurers for their hefty price tags.\n\n\u201cThe focus will be on how you deliver the best value and the best price for patients,\u201d said Clare Krusing, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group. \u201cBut when these new medications across the board are bringing five- and six-figure price tags, that\u2019s becoming the new norm. So we have to negotiate from a higher starting point.\u201d\n\nExecutive vice president Anthony C. Hooper said Amgen \u201cis sensitive to the concerns of payers around cost, budget predictability, and paying for value.\u201d\n\nRepatha and the rival PCSK9 injectable called Praluent, made by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., may eventually face increased competition. But health insurers are expected to try to restrict the market for PCSK9 drugs to the highest-risk cardiovascular patients, said Peter Chang, principal scientific analyst at Informa PLC in San Diego.\n\n\u201cThese drugs are a breakthrough,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey dramatically lower LDL cholesterol levels and have the potential to reduce cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes even further for people who also take statins.\u201d\n\nMost cholesterol drug patients pay less than $250 a year because the statin market is dominated by low-cost generics, said Steve Miller, chief medical officer for Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefits manager, which negotiates pricing with drug companies on behalf of insurers and employers.\n\n\u201cThese drugs represent an enormous step up to more than $10,000 a year,\u201d said Miller, who added that drug makers hope to win approval for PCSK9 drugs as \u201cfirst-line\u201d treatments for primary prevention. \u201cThis will probably over time become the biggest class of drugs in history.\u201d\n\nEven as second-line therapies, the new drugs could represent a big share of the market for all cholesterol drugs \u2014 projected to be as much as $24 billion in 2018 by the research firm IMS Health.\n\n\u201cWe believe the PCSK9 class could be $5 billion to $10 billion worldwide long term, and Amgen could get around half the share,\u201d said Michael J. Yee, at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAmgen\u2019s drug will be produced at its plant in Rhode Island, where Amgen also makes Enbrel, a top-selling drug for rheumatoid arthritis, and Vectibix, for colorectal cancer.\n\nThe new drugs have been shown to lower bad cholesterol 54 to 77 percent.

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 Broadband adoption in the U.S. continues to rise, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet & American Life Project. Among adults 18 and older, 70% have broadband access at home \u2014 up from 66% a year ago.\n\nAs Pew notes, that\u2019s a significant increase. But a deeper look at the numbers shows that broadband deployment in the U.S. remains sub-par, especially when you consider that the Internet was invented here, and we\u2019re supposed to be the global leader in innovation.\n\nThe survey considers \u201cbroadband\u201d to be anything that delivers download speeds of 4 Mbps, which is about what the most anemic DSL services provide. That\u2019s actually accurate enough (the FCC uses the same standard) \u2014 and that\u2019s the problem. Akamai reported in April that the average broadband speed in the U.S. had actually grown by 28% in the previous year \u2014 to a pathetic 7.4 Mbps. The U.S. came in eighth in Akamai\u2019s ranking \u2014 just after the Czech Republic, which boasts an average broadband speed of 8.1 Mbps. South Korea placed first, with 14 Mbps. Japan\u2019s average was 10.8.\n\nMORE: The Microsoft CEO candidate no one is discussing\n\nParts of Pew\u2019s survey report assume that smartphones provide \u201cbroadband access.\u201d That might help make the digital divide seem a bit narrower, as long as you don\u2019t think about it too much. Yes, you can watch movies on your phone, but even if the movies run smoothly, watching them can quickly eat up data caps and cost money.\n\nOtherwise, Pew reports that while 90% of college graduates have broadband in their homes, only 37% of non-high school graduates and 54% of those making less than $30,000 a year do. There are racial differences, too, but according to Pew, ownership of smartphones among blacks and Hispanics nearly bridges that gap.\n\nIn some ways, that makes sense. If you have neither in-home broadband nor a smartphone, you\u2019re way behind someone with one or both. But that shouldn\u2019t lead us to believe that owning a smartphone makes up for the lack of home broadband.\n\nLaw professor Susan Crawford, who analyzes the communications industry, writes at Wired that counting slow bandwidth at home, and counting smartphones as broadband, \u201callows us to pretend there\u2019s a vibrant marketplace for high-speed Internet access, with satellite duking it out with cable modem access, mobile wireless supplanting the need for a wire at home, and no need for oversight or a change in industrial policy.\u201d",

        "text": "Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins opened its defense in court Monday against allegations of sexism by former partner Ellen Pao by attacking her request for millions of dollars in damages.\n\nPao, who has sued her former employer for gender discrimination and retaliation for complaining about it, is seeking $16 million. She has said the amount sends a strong message the Silicon Valley firm for her firing and for making her unemployable as an investor.\n\nBut David Lewin, a former management professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and expert witness for Kleiner Perkins, said he thought the amount was excessive. His argument: Pao didn\u2019t really try hard enough to get a venture capital or higher-paying job and that any lost income from her eventual firing was her own fault.\n\nKleiner\u2019s defense, which kicked off this morning, follows three weeks of testimony by Pao and her witnesses. They painted a picture of a firm in which female employees are passed over for promotions, asked to take notes for male colleagues and are left off the guest list for an important all-male dinner.\n\nTo counter that image, Kleiner Perkins attorney, Lynne Hermle, said she will call a roster of 17 witnesses who are expected to vigorously defend the firm and its behavior. During cross examinations since the trial started, she has gone on the offense against Pao by pushing the idea that she was unqualified for her job and a constant source of drama.\n\nThe high-profile case is being closely followed in the tech industry, which despite its image for innovation, is lot like the smokestack industries before it. Women are in short supply at all levels.\n\nLewin, who was paid $750 per hour Kleiner Perkins to help its case (and has billed more than $86,000 so far), explained a thesis that could be boiled down to two things. The first, is that Pao didn\u2019t broaden her search enough in terms of geography and types of positions. The second is that she had sufficient qualifications to be able to get a great job fairly quickly after leaving Kleiner, but didn\u2019t really try.\n\n\u201cMs. Pao conducted\u2026 a limited search,\u201d Lewin said on the stand. \u201cMy understanding is that she pursued one job in venture capital.\u201d\n\nThe job in question was based in Brazil, and nothing came out of her early conversations with the firm. Lewin later added that, to his knowledge, Pao never sought the help of a headhunting firm or other service that could help her land the type of job she wanted.\n\nLewin also argued that Pao\u2019s education, work experience, extensive network she built, and even the on-the-job mentoring and training she received while at Kleiner would have put her in an excellent position to get a job as an investor, or at least a very well-paying job doing something else. In fact, Lewin believes she should have been able to find \u201ccomparable employment within one to four months\u201d after leaving Kleiner.\n\nPao, who is currently interim CEO of online forum Reddit, could have avoided any damages at all, Lewin said \u2014 that\u2019s $0 in damages, to be exact.\n\nEarlier today, Kleiner\u2019s side kicked off its day of discrediting Pao with a heated cross-examination of Allison West, Pao\u2019s expert witness on employment investigations. West has been asked to discuss all the shortcomings in a third-party investigation Kleiner Perkins paid for following another female partner\u2019s complaints of harassment back in 2012.\n\nKleiner attorney Lynne Hermle tried to shake her confidence: \u201cDid you meet with counsel to discuss your testimony during break?\u201d West explained that they chatted about a female partner\u2019s statements during the investigation, to refresh her memory.",

The email didn't go into detail. \"Business casual\" was the term used.\n\nThat morning, I put on my khakis, blue button-down shirt and nice loafers, hopped in a cab and went to the office. I played it safe \u2014 right down the middle. We would later call this, \"The Wall Street Jumpsuit.\"\n\nRead MoreThe escort indicator: Wall Street is booming again\n\nThat's one of the most basic rules: Keep it simple. Don't draw attention to yourself. You can mix and match and move things around, but leave the crazy individual fashion statements for the club.\n\nAs I made my way to the desk, everyone looked different. It was like when you're in fourth grade and you'd see your elementary teacher at the grocery store. You realize, hey, they're actually a real person! It was like a peek behind the curtain to their personality.\n\nAnd scrutiny was at an all-time high.\n\nI flipped on my computer and started getting ready for the day. That's when I saw a Hawaiian shirt strolling by. I did a double-take and immediately exchanged a look with my desk-mate Lauren. We both giggled. To some, a Hawaiian shirt might symbolize a fun loving and carefree guy.\n\nBut just because you can do it doesn't mean you should. Don't get me wrong, I built an entire career on being different \u2014 but it has limits.\n\nRead MoreSummer in the Hamptons will be sizzling\n\nA few weeks later, a female co-worker was wearing something that looked like it could be balled up on Kim Kardashian's bedroom floor. It was white and basically see-through. She looked great \u2014 maybe too great. Although this was long before Twitter existed, her white shirt was trending throughout the entire company. Employees from different departments were getting emails and then finding excuses to stop by the 37th floor to catch a look.\n\nBeyond the murmuring, sideways glances and damage to your reputation, a Casual Friday faux pas could get you slapped with an unwanted nickname forever (not just during your time at the company). You're branded for life. And you can't recover from this.\n\nSo, with the help of some of my friends, here's a list of some of the more infamous nicknames on Wall Street that came straight from Casual Friday:\n\n\"Black Jeans.\" I'm not sure if it was solely because of the color of his jeans. It might have also had something to do with the tightness of them. But this gentleman was called Black Jeans for years. In private, of course. You don't want to be rude.\n\n\"Coldplay.\" The dude wore the shirt once. But it was more of his reaction that created the nickname that would stick for the rest of his time at the company. He adamantly defended himself by saying he didn't like the band, but he liked the colors of the shirt. The lesson here is: Don't defend your mistakes.\n\n\"Da Plane!\" A woman in Chicago chose to wear a shirt that was fully revealing in the back. All of her peers got to see the monster ink she was representing. Her entire back was tatt'd up. So, taking from the show, \"Fantasy Island,\" they decided the best nickname for her was Tattoo's catch phrase, \"Da Plane! Da Plane!\"\n\nSFP (a.k.a, \"Sorry For Partying\"). Thursday nights were epic for this guy and he would always apologize for it the next day. \"I'm sorry for partying,\" he would spout the next morning. And he was really sorry the day he accidentally came to work wearing two different kinds of shoes. This is not considered casual; it's considered still drunk.\n\nJBF (\"Just Been F\u2026.\"). Her hair screamed, \"I just had sex!\" Apparently her boyfriend's apartment was right near the office and that's where she slept on Thursday nights. You can get a pass for smelling like Taco Bell and Patron, but at least put a comb through your hair.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say these things will stick with you FOR LIFE. If I bumped into Black Jeans on the street today, I'd still call him Black Jeans.\n\nRead MoreHelicopter to your beach house? There's an app for that\n\nButtons. Yes, those seemingly benign things on your shirt \u2014 they, too, can break you. How many buttons unbuttoned is acceptable? The answer is: Two. (Personally, I'm more of a three-button guy.) Four? BUZZER! Unacceptable. Nobody wants to see your impressive amount of chest hair and the office isn't cocktail hour in the Hamptons. So, unbutton at your own risk.\n\nThis is not to diss all casual attire, but rather to say that there is a time and place for your Nantucket Reds, your club logo'd golf shirt, the tight-fitting ensemble and boat shoes without socks. Just not on Wall Street. Not on Casual Friday.\n\nSo, the next time a Wall Streeter with a black card steps to the register holding a new wardrobe, they shouldn't be asking themselves: How much will this cost? They should be wondering: What could this potentially cost me if I wear it at the office?\n\nIf you don't work on Wall Street, aloha! Enjoy that Hawaiian shirt.",

King found Tuesday that the song\u2019s original copyright, obtained by the Clayton F. Summy Co. from the song\u2019s writers and bought for $15 million in 1988 by Warner/Chappell Music Inc., only covered specific piano arrangements of the song and not its lyrics.\n\nThe basic \u2018\u2018Happy Birthday\u2019\u2019 tune, derived from another popular children\u2019s song, \u2018\u2018Good Morning to All,\u2019\u2019 has long been in the public domain, and King\u2019s decision, though it could be appealed, makes the entirety fair game for use.\n\n\u2018\u2018\u2019Happy Birthday\u2019 is finally free after 80 years,\u2019\u2019 Randall Newman, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOne of the co-plaintiffs, Ruypa Marya of the music group Ruypa & The April Fishes, also praised the decision as momentous, saying \u2018\u2018I hope we can start reimagining copyright law to do what it\u2019s supposed to do \u2014 protect the creations of people who make stuff so that we can continue to make more stuff.\u2019\u2019\n\nMarya, said she had paid Warner/Chappell $455 to include the song on a live album during which members of her band and audience sang the song to her the night before her birthday.\n\nWarner/Chappell has said it doesn\u2019t try to collect royalties from just anyone singing the song but those who use it in a commercial enterprise.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are looking at the court\u2019s lengthy opinion and considering our options,\u2019\u2019 Warner/Chappell said in a statement following Tuesday\u2019s ruling.\n\nKing\u2019s decision comes in a lawsuit filed two years ago by Good Morning To You Productions Corp., which is working on a documentary film tentatively titled \u2018\u2018Happy Birthday.\u2019\u2019 The company challenged the copyright, arguing that the song should be \u2018\u2018dedicated to public use and in the public domain.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Because Summy Co. never acquired the rights to the \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 lyrics, defendants, as Summy Co.\u2019s purported successors-in-interest, do not own a valid copyright in the Happy Birthday lyrics,\u2019\u2019 King concluded in his 43-page ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit also asked for monetary damages and restitution of more than $5 million in licensing fees it said in 2013 that Warner/Chappell had collected from thousands of people and groups who\u2019ve paid to use the song over the years.\n\nMarshall Lamm, a spokesman for one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said that issue would be determined later.\n\nIn his ruling King went into great detail about the history of \u2018\u2018Happy Birthday To You,\u2019\u2019 and its derivation from \u2018\u2018Good Morning to All.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat song was written by sisters Mildred Hill and Patty Hill sometime before 1893, the judge said, adding that the sisters assigned the rights to it and other songs to Clayton F. Summy, who copyrighted and published them in a book titled \u2018\u2018Song Stories for the Kindergarten.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018The origins of the lyrics to Happy Birthday ... are less clear,\u2019\u2019 the judge continued, adding the first known reference to them appeared in a 1901 article in the Inland Educator and Indiana School Journal.\n\nThe full lyrics themselves, King said, didn\u2019t appear in print until 1911.\n\nSince then, they have become the most famous lyrics in the English language, according to Guinness World Records. The song is also sung in countless other languages around the world.",

And when a 240,000-square-foot expansion of headquarters is completed in 2016, employees will get to ride on a 65-foot Ferris wheel\u2014indoors.\n\n\u201cAcuity really put us on the map with its flag pole since you can see it as you drive on I-43,\u201d says Sheboygan mayor Michael Vandersteen. Yes, these outside landmarks are eye-catching. But Acuity chief executive officer Ben Salzmann portrays them as gifts to the community and are a way for the company to \u201cinstitutionalize\u201d its place in it \u2014 including the spelling bee and 4-H banquet that Acuity hosts for the county every year.\n\nNot all of those gestures have gone off without a hitch. The current flagpole is Acuity\u2019s fourth; one earlier 150-foot version topped over due to the stress of high winds and another swayed so wildly even without a flag that the company removed it.\n\nFounded in 1925 by farmers in Wisconsin looking to insure against the hazards of horseless carriages, Acuity, with $1.1 billion in annual revenue, makes an impressive debut at No. 3 on this year\u2019s list of Fortune\u2018s 100 Best Companies to Work For, alongside global companies like Google and Boston Consulting Group.\n\nHow does it compete? On top of perks like unlimited education reimbursement, compressed workweeks, a 10% company contribution to employees\u2019 401(k) funds, and healthy medical plans, Salzmann says Acuity has instilled loyalty among its employees by empowering them and giving them a say in the company\u2019s future. Quarterly town hall meetings keep employees up to speed on the company\u2019s performance. It also sponsors a \u201clunch with an officer\u201d program, in which every employee gets a face-to-face meeting with executives. The company lets employees decide which organizations receive annual charity donations\u2014it gave away just over $1 million in the last year\u2014and invites them to take part in strategic planning. For all those reasons, workers have raved, and annual full-time voluntary turnover is a ridiculously low 2%.\n\nYet the best example of employee enthusiasm and loyalty can be found on YouTube in a short video bearing the title ACUITY Zombie Apocalype. It\u2019s the collaborative work of 40 employees who dressed as the undead for a four-minute explainer about why they love their jobs. The video\u2019s tagline? \u201cAcuity is a great place to work now \u2026 and after the zombie apocalypse.\u201d It took one day to film and two weeks to produce, all during working hours.\n\nIn addition to welcoming oddball initiatives, employees say their suggestions are taken seriously and their contributions are rewarded on more individualized bases.

Obviously a place called the USA can still be found on the map, but today's WikiLeaked behemoth is no longer the dream nation that once seemed to epitomise everything modern, big and brave.\n\nGrowing up in Wales, born just in time to see the moon landings on TV, I absorbed this great American myth like children all over the world. But to look at the art of one of the most idealising observers of that lost America is to see how fragile, how brief, its golden age really was.\n\nThe first of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers displayed at Dulwich Picture Gallery was published on 20 May 1916; the last, on 14 December 1963. That is the end of this selection of magazines but not of his work \u2013 the exhibition has a painted study for his rightly famous 1964 picture of Ruby Bridges walking to school in defiance of rotten vegetables thrown by segregationists that splatter the wall behind her. But in the 60s, as he records protest and revolution, is it still \"Norman Rockwell's America\" he paints?\n\nThe same question arises when you try to make sense of his early works from the first world war and the 1920s. Their lost world of knickerbockered tearaways and brave doughboys (American soldiers in the great war) seems not just remote, but somehow, not America at all as we imagine it. America was an invention, you realize by looking at the work of Rockwell, one of its inventors, and what startles is to realise how recent that invention is.\n\nOnly in the 1930s does his America start to look like the confident modern nation of band music and the movies; and it is in the 1940s with images such as Rosie the Riveter that Rockwell captures the deeply attractive qualities of that American modernity with its sense of freedom and potential equality.\n\nMovingly, Rockwell defied the conservatism of his image and perhaps of his fans when he lent his visual eloquence to the civil rights cause in the 1960s.\n\nThis exhibition, the first of his original works in this country, does him an injustice. It fails to respond to the surprise and the radicalism of Rockwell at his best \u2013 there is more emphasis on coy Christmas scenes than on his powerful paintings of an America growing into its imperial greatness and then facing up to its failings.\n\nInstead of popularising Rockwell (and America) with a young British audience, it seems happy to see him as a safe figurative artist and positively glories in his most conservative traits.\n\nIn America this talented artist has been reclaimed as a visionary of liberalism and tolerance; but in Dulwich he comes across as an obscure nostalgist and his era, the American century that on this evidence lasted just two decades from 1940 to 1960, seems further away than ever. At his best he suggests why we are going to miss it.\n\nNorman Rockwell's America is at Dulwich Picture Gallery, Gallery Road, Dulwich, London SE21 7AD, until 27 March.",

        "text": "A Biography of D. H. Kahnweiler, 1884-1979.\n\nIllustrated. 411 pp. New York:\n\nDaniel-Henry Kahnweiler was 23 years old when he opened his first art gallery in Paris. It occupied a tiny space on the Rue Vignon, near the Madeleine, and its aspiring proprietor did not have a single artist under contract. Indeed, he had hardly met any. The year was 1907 - an important date in the history of the Paris avant-garde. Like many of the people who took an avid interest in avant-garde developments in Paris at that historic moment, Kahnweiler was a foreigner - a German Jew, born in Mannheim, whose prosperous family had expected him to follow tradition by making a career in the stock market or the banking business. Instead, he decided to become an art dealer, and - what was even more shocking - a dealer in avant-garde art. ''He knew nothing about the business of selling art,'' Pierre Assouline writes in his biography of Kahnweiler, ''knowing more about art itself than about the art market.''\n\nWhat Kahnweiler did possess in large measure, however, was a keen sensibility for the modernist art that was meeting with such adamant hostility from established opinion. For those in the know, of course, Paris loomed as the international capital of the modern movement - the magnet that drew ambitious, independent talent from every corner of the Western world - but neither the French public nor the French press was yet willing to grant the achievements of the modernists even minimal recognition. The rejection of everything avant-garde in Paris was still fierce and unforgiving.\n\nIn 1907, the brunt of this philistine abuse was directed against Matisse and the Fauves - ''Wild Beasts'' - who had lately exhibited their audacious paintings in the Salon d'Automne (1905) and the Salon des Independants (1906). It was indicative of the course Kahnweiler set for himself that he promptly got to know Matisse and began acquiring pictures by the other Fauves - Andre Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Georges Braque and Kees van Dongen - for his new gallery. Matisse, though ridiculed in the press with the others, already commanded prices that were too high for Kahnweiler to handle at that early stage of his career, and Matisse was in any case attached to an established gallery (Bernheim-Jeune). None of the others were.\n\nIt was through another German resident in Paris - the collector and writer Wilhelm Uhde, who was later to write a book titled ''Picasso and the French Tradition'' - that Kahnweiler met the artist with whom, above all others, his name would be forever linked. Pablo Picasso was then 26. He had just completed a large painting that left all of his artist friends deeply shocked. Uhde described it to Kahnweiler as ''Assyrian'' in style, and urged him to see it. Kahnweiler, who - as Mr. Assouline writes - ''knew nothing about Picasso,'' thus went to Picasso's studio to have a look at this strange ''Assyrian'' painting.\n\nIt turned out that Picasso had already paid a visit to the gallery in the Rue Vignon with Ambroise Vollard, a dealer Kahnweiler greatly respected. With that irresistible touch of malice the young dealer would soon become familiar with, Picasso immediately repeated to Kahnweiler a disparaging comment Vollard had made about him on that occasion. ''Do you know what Vollard said to me on leaving your gallery?'' Picasso asked. ''He said, 'This is a young man whose family gave him a gallery for his first communion.' '' Kahnweiler was naturally wounded by this gibe, but he (characteristically) sloughed it off. He was transfixed by the painting - ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' as it was later called.\n\n''When Kahnweiler finally saw the painting,'' Mr. Assouline writes, ''it came as a complete shock; he was astounded at first and then dazzled. He felt that something admirable, extraordinary, inconceivable had occurred. He was totally unprepared for this vision, and it stunned him. . . . It was wonderful, crazy, and monstrous at the same time, and yet moving. Without a doubt this work was completely new and important.'' For a work of art to be both new and important was already for Kahnweiler the key issue, and he had great confidence in his own judgment. The next day he returned to Picasso's studio to buy some of the paintings that were preliminary studies for ''Les Demoiselles.'' As for ''Les Demoiselles'' itself, Picasso wasn't ready to sell it and Kahnweiler wasn't then in a position to buy it. But a bond of a sort had been established between them. At the crucial moment Kahnweiler hadn't flinched. He had in fact responded with genuine excitement. Equally important, he acted upon his response with prompt cash purchases. ''Picasso was touched by his exceptional enthusiasm,'' Mr. Assouline writes. ''Kahnweiler was one of the few people to believe in him completely and absolutely at a moment when Picasso had touched bottom. . . . From that moment their fates were sealed.''",

Defense is something you can control better than offense. For our team to be totally committed to being a great defensive team, (it) will take us the furthest we can go.\"\n\nHis players say they've taken the lessons to heart en route to a 32-3 record heading into Saturday's game.\n\nWhat was senior point guard T.J. McConnell's prime takeaway?\n\n\"How close they were as a team,\" McConnell said. \"He wanted our team to be like that. We've watched it so many times that we're pretty much like that. We kind of figured it out as they kept talking about how close they were and what they would do for each other. We said to ourselves we have to be like that.\"\n\nSuccess didn't come easily or overnight for the Bad Boy Pistons. They had to get past the reigning powers of the time, the Celtics in the East and the Lakers in West. After several years of knocking on the door, the Chuck Daly-coached Pistons won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990.\n\nIt's a journey that Arizona can relate to -- the Wildcats have twice been one basket away from the Final Four during Miller's tenure but have yet to take that big step.\n\n\"How Coach (Miller) viewed it was we have been knocking on the door of a Pac-12 championship and the Final Four,\" said Ryan Reynolds, Arizona's director of basketball operations. \"Our program, like the Pistons, has to break down some doors.\"\n\nMiller first showed the tape last summer -- initially to his returning players, then to his entire team. They've watched it at least four times, enough to have broken down some parts into segments to illustrate points.\n\nChief among them are the staples of a championship team: Defense and rebounding.\n\n\"(That) was the backbone of their team,\" said Arizona assistant coach Joe Pasternack. \"Everybody had a certain role on the team, and everybody had to accept that role.\"\n\nIsiah Thomas was the leader. That's McConnell.\n\nBill Laimbeer was the enforcer. Kaleb Tarczewski, though lacking Laimbeer's mean streak, plays that role for the Wildcats.\n\nMark Aguirre, the scorer, comes in the form of freshman Stanley Johnson.\n\nAnd Rondae Hollis-Jefferson plays defense like Dennis Rodman and has the personality of John Salley.\n\n\"In that aspect, as far as being the hustle guy, diving on the floor for a loose ball, having energy, I would say, 'yeah,' \" Hollis-Jefferson said, agreeing with the Rodman comparison.\n\n\"Know your role,\" he said. \"If you think about it, in a way, we're like them because we have so many situations, so many places where we didn't break through. They (Pistons) were getting closer and closer every time. Eventually they broke through.\n\n\"It's time to break through.\"\n\nTarczewski added three points: Playing with heart, being physical and being unafraid.\n\n\"It was about being all in and playing hard basketball,\" he said. \"That was the most important thing. They were a team, and everyone was playing their hardest, doing everything they could to win. That's what we're trying to do.\n\n\"They were a family. Everyone was trying to win. That's what he was trying to tell us. It was good for us. It provided our team a lot of motivation.\"\n\nFor Johnson, the prevailing message was one of toughness, to be the \"baddest boys\" on the court.\n\n\"We're not going to get punked, not going to back down from anybody,\" Johnson said. \"It's not about how big or tough you are. We're going to show you -- and not by fist fighting -- but how we crash the glass and how we play offense and defense.\n\n\"If we lose, we're going to lose the right way, doing our thing.

        "text": "The years 1967 and 1969 were known for their festivals, but live music in the \u201960s may have had no better year than 1968, when club rock hit a kind of Hall of Fame peak. The days of rubbish amps and teenybopper gaggles were in the past, and the two Fillmore venues \u2014 one on each coast \u2014 were the psychedelic Mecca and Medina of the post-pop crowd.\n\n\u201cSly and the Family Stone: Live at the Fillmore East \u2014 October 4th & 5th, 1968,\u201d a four-disc set, released last week and comprising four shows played across two nights, is sourced from New York \u2014 and, one might add, plenty of people\u2019s wish lists, since there has been so little live Sly available over the years. And with the opening notes of \u201cAre You Ready\u201d \u2014 a query doubling as a warning that you are about to get seriously rocked \u2014 it\u2019s evident that this is going to be one doozy of a box.\n\nThe first show has some technical bugs, \u2014 amps act up, microphones fluctuate \u2014 but that only serves to bolster an inchoate feel from which Stone had a knack for wringing rhythm. The second show that night is pure groove, including a version of \u201cDance to the Music\u201d with a pliancy that even the well-known studio cut lacks. It\u2019s all the more remarkable given that blues, R&B, soul jazz, hambone satire, Louis Armstrong-style vocalese, and Bachian modulations all go into the mix. That it works seamlessly is pure Sly, which is why he mattered as rock and soul\u2019s foremost assimilator.\n\nOne highlight of the early show from the second night is a treatment of \u201cColor Me True\u201d with barbershop polyphonies brought to bear amid the Family\u2019s perpetual roiling. \u201cDo you take credit for somebody else\u2019s cooking?\u201d goes one refrain, inviting the response, nope, this is all you guys. The third show also features the best version of the Otis Redding-like stomper \u201cM\u2019Lady,\u201d and goodness how it churns and burns. Pumping bass, full-throated horns, giant fistfuls of funky organ notes, cannonades of drums: This is just a massive sound, punctuated with unaccompanied vocals that in turn morph into wordless instruments.\n\nThings come completely untethered at the final show, a soul-music symposium voiced by members of a band that had never been tighter as a live act. The \u201cTurn Me Loose / I Can\u2019t Turn You Loose\u201d medley might as well come with an advisory to don a helmet, lest you dance too hard and jar your skull against a wall. Sister Rosie Stone, on keyboards and vocals, is a huge presence throughout, and at one point Stone pleads with the sound man to turn her up. Hers is the voice that cuts best through Stone\u2019s slab of sound.\n\nStone himself is quite the sound painter on the organ. It\u2019s something for which he\u2019s never been given a ton of credit: That organ that manages to be both an obvious hallmark of the band at its greatest fettle and a surprise, too, when it comes washing over you.\n\nThere\u2019s enough variety here that you understand why the whole shebang needed to come out \u2014 and vintage audiophiles will just about bow down before the quality of these tapes. Had a record label released that second show from Oct. 4 as a single LP back in its day, we\u2019d be going on almost five decades now with a live Sly Stone album counting as as one of the best ever waxed.

Residents lived under U.S. rule for the next 27 years.\n\nEven now, Okinawa hosts nearly 75 percent of the U.S. military presence in Japan, taking up 18 percent of its land area.\n\nAbe's push to beef up Japan's military, driven by China's growing assertiveness, has some worried in Okinawa, which sits some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) south of Tokyo. Last month, buoyed by December's re-election, his government passed a record $42 billion defence budget.\n\n\"In the hypothetical case of a military 'situation,' Tokyo is so far away it won't feel the pain, just like 70 years ago,\" Nago mayor Susumu Inamine told Reuters.\n\n\"Then, Okinawa helped buy time for the home islands, and this thinking basically hasn't changed. People on the mainland want Okinawans to put up with everything so they can feel safe.\"\n\nEveryone agrees that Futenma, crammed in the middle of a densely-populated residential area, must be moved. But a rising number of Okinawans now say it should be shifted from the islands altogether. Reasons include the planned deployment of the controversial Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, loathed for its noise, among other reasons.\n\nRead MoreCranking up reforms: Tokyo analysts to lose overtime pay\n\n\"The vibrations make your insides go numb,\" said Kanako Kawakami, a 56-year-old resident of Ginowan, the site of Futenma.\n\nHuddled among a group of 100 protesters, Kawakami was part of a round-the-clock vigil on a hillside in front of Camp Schwab, a U.S. base that abuts the Henoko site.\n\nDump trucks arrived in the dead of night. In January, an 80-year-old woman was hurt in clashes between protesters and riot police.\n\nThe bases have always been a devil's bargain for Japan's second-poorest prefecture, where unemployment is about 75 percent higher than the national average.\n\nIn the rundown city of Nago, Abe's vaunted economic growth policies appear to have had little impact on its 61,500 residents. Some are resigned. \"Bases bring in money,\" said taxi driver Masatsune Naka, 65. \"People have to support families.\"\n\nTo help the prefecture, Tokyo has provided a generous development budget, insisting it is not linked to bases.\n\nBut after the election of anti-base governor Takeshi Onaga in November, and the trouncing of ruling party candidates in a December parliamentary election, the government said it was cutting the budget by 16 billion yen to 334 billion yen in the 2015/16 fiscal year.\n\nAnd as the percentage of the island's GDP coming from the bases falls - from 15 percent in 1972 to 4.9 percent in 2011 - Okinawans are aware they need to be more self-reliant.\n\nTourism now accounts for nearly 10 percent of GDP, including a hefty number of foreigners.\n\nFreeing up base land for local use would also allow expansion of growing industries such as information technology and call centers.\n\nEconomically, though, things would be tough. Okinawa's GDP ranks alongside that of the tiny Pacific island of Tuvalu.\n\n\"There's no way we'd ever declare independence, we couldn't feed ourselves,\" said Satoru Kinjo, head of the local branch of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nBut islander anger, and the government's response, could pose a national danger for Abe. On Jan. 25, nearly 7,000 people gathered to protest the Henoko base in Tokyo.\n\n\"The Japanese people will be watching what happens here,\" Inamine, the Nago mayor, said. \"People who have supported the government and LDP up to now won't be able to excuse their excesses anymore.\"",

        "text": "Some companies embrace change. Some get suffocated in change\u2019s embrace. And shares of International Business Machines (IBM) have performed dismally in recent years because investors have no idea which of those categories it belongs to.\n\nIBM ibm , the Armonk, N.Y., tech giant that turned 105 years old this week, has been stuck at a junction since before Ginni Rometty took the helm as CEO in 2012. The older computing technology on which the company and its white-button-down, black-tie consultants built their dominance in the 20th century, such as servers and mainframes, has crept toward obsolescence. IBM knows that its future lies in cloud technology and artificial intelligence\u2014and Rometty steadfastly preaches that gospel. But the old tech is declining faster than the new tech is growing. Revenue has fallen for 16 consecutive quarters, to $81.7 billion in 2015, and since its March 2013 peak, IBM\u2019s stock is down 30%, trailing the S&P 500 by a mercy-rule-\u00adinvoking 62 percentage points. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when that will end,\u201d \u00adlaments Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz.\n\nThe advent of cloud computing, which enables corporations to store and manage their data without investing in their own costly infrastructure, changed everything for IBM. The cloud slashed demand for both its servers and the highly profitable consulting and support services that IBM paired with them.\n\nIBM is competing in the cloud, which accounted for $10.8 billion, or 13% of its overall revenue over the past year. But the company has thrown much of its effort behind so-called hybrid cloud services that incorporate private servers, allowing the company to continue providing \u201cmiddleware\u201d and support to clients. Middleware accounts for about 40% of IBM\u2019s profits, according to Moskowitz. But that business model puts the company at a disadvantage against competitors like Amazon amzn and Microsoft msft that emphasize less expensive \u201cpublic cloud\u201d services. \u201cYou don\u2019t get fired for going with Amazon Web Services,\u201d UBS analyst Steven Milunovich says that company CIOs have told him. \u201cIt\u2019s the new IBM.\u201d\n\nWith IBM well below 10% in cloud market share by most estimates, few investors think that business will help the company turn its fortunes around. Bulls are placing their bets instead on IBM\u2019s machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) efforts\u2014represented in the public eye by Watson, the glib-toned box showcased on Jeopardy! and innumerable commercials.\n\nMorgan Stanley ms analyst Katy Huberty, who earlier this year upgraded her recommendation on IBM from the equivalent of neutral to buy, considers IBM a front-runner in the AI race, since Watson\u2019s analytical capabilities have potential applications in fields ranging from travel to finance to retail. Huberty says she\u2019s encouraged by IBM\u2019s recent push to acquire a monster trove of AI-oriented data\u2014\u00adespecially in the health care sector, where IBM Watson Health bought Truven Health Analytics in February for $2.6 billion.\n\nIBM doesn\u2019t break out figures for its AI work\u2014a sore point among investors who are looking for clearer data, says Moskowitz. But analysts say that IBM\u2019s \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d business, which includes AI efforts as well as cloud, security, and other initiatives, will surpass 50% of revenues by mid-2017. The business accounted for $28.9 billion in sales in 2015, up 17% from 2014. While there\u2019s plenty of competition in this realm too\u2014Google googl and Microsoft have their own AI \u00adambitions\u2014Huberty believes that if IBM manages even a 25% market share, AI will be \u201ceasily a $50 billion business\u201d for the company.\n\nFor more on IBM, watch this Fortune video:\n\nThat, of course, is a big if, and one many investors aren\u2019t willing to bet on. Only seven of 26 analysts who follow the company rate it a buy or strong buy\u2014an unusually low ratio in that bullish community. Institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds have also fled, accounting for only 66% of IBM shares, according to Morningstar; for comparable tech giants like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Cisco Systems csco , that figure is 82% or more. But if IBM does finally reverse its revenue declines, those institutions could pile back into the stock\u2014generating a nice pop for people willing to invest in it now. (\u201cAnother reason not to be super bearish,\u201d notes Milunovich.)\n\nInvestors who take that gamble would be buying a still-profitable company for a very low 11 times 2017 earnings, and collecting a 3.4% dividend (far above the S&P 500\u2019s average) while they waited. They would be waiting in prestigious company. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway brk.a , IBM\u2019s single largest shareholder, has bought more than 12 million shares since the end of 2013, giving it a total of 81 million. Buffett bought nearly 200,000 in the quarter that ended in March.\n\nOf course, Buffett has also admitted that he may be wrong. The takeaway: Don\u2019t bet money on IBM that you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nA version of this article appears in the July 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cPondering the Puzzle of IBM.\u201d",

'LIKE' US HERE.\n\nThe Elantra has introduced a Sport version that is actually, well, sporty.\n\nWith a 1.6-liter Turbo GDI four-cylinder engine replacing last year\u2019s 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder and a new design that is reminiscent of the Mazda3, the 2017 Elantra Sport is worth a look for driving enthusiasts looking for a bargain.\n\nHorsepower has been increased from 173 in the 2016 model to 200 in the 2017. Likewise, torque has jumped from 154 pound-feet to 190. Add in a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with paddle shifters along with a multi-link rear suspension that promises a more dynamic driving experience and Hyundai is starting to encroach on Jetta GLI territory.\n\nThe new Elantra Sport also looks the part. Hyundai has dumped the round, Prius-like body of Elantras past in favor of a more angular body with a longer hood and more powerful lines to go with that new, Mazda3-esque grille and elongated headlights.\n\nThe elephant in the room or rather the elephant suspiciously missing from the room is price. It\u2019s not yet clear how much 2017 Elantra Sport will cost or how its price tag will compare to that of the Jetta GLI, the standard bearer in the world of performance-oriented compact sedans. In 2016, the Jetta GLI had an MSRP that was a solid $9,000 more than the Elantra Sport, which clocked in at a little more than $20,000 for a manual transmission.\n\nWith all the reworking and restyling done by Hyundai, it\u2019s tough to imagine it won\u2019t be asking for a little more coin this time around.

New music that makes my ??a flutter. Check this 17 yr old angel @AURORAmusic RUNAWAY https://t.co/KLZRLeSiVk pic.twitter.com/scJvDfDgSU\n\nThe revelation ahead of the release of John Lewis' advert launch on Friday morning puts an end to hopes that Adele, who recently returned to the record books with her new single Hello, would be the voice of this year's festive spot from the retailer.\n\nRumour has it that the new John Lewis Christmas ad will feature Adele doing a cover of Peter Andre's 1996 hit, Mysterious Girl\n\nSpeculation had intensified after a 10-second teaser with just the hashtag #OnTheMoon, which many believe to be a teaser for the John Lewis advert, appeared during a Sunday night episode of The X Factor \u2013 notably similar to how Adele had chosen to tease the release of her new song in a previous week.\n\nManic Street Preacher fans will be disappointed that their petition to have the band record the John Lewis advert was unsuccessful.\n\nWord is this year's Christmas John Lewis song is a winsome acoustic cover of Chumbawamba's TubThumping\n\nThe Christmas advert will feature a cover of the Oasis song Half the World Away, a 1994 B-side that doubled as the theme tune to The Royle Family.\n\nThe song would fit well thematically with the #OnTheMoon rumours.\n\nTwo of the six songs used in John Lewis' Christmas adverts, since it started working with the agency Adam & Eve / DDB in 2009, have reached number one in the charts.\n\nTaken by Trees kicked off the John Lewis tradition of having breathy covers of classic pop songs. The Swedish singer recorded Sweet Child O' Mine, the 1988 rock anthem from Guns N' Roses. Taken by Trees' version, which was also used in the final scene of the 2010 film Life As We Know It starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel, reached number 23 in the UK charts.\n\nSince 2010, the adverts have focused on British songs and singers. Ellie Goulding's cover of Your Song, originally released by Elton John 40 years earlier, peaked at number two in the charts, with sales at the time of 72,292 copies, and topped the UK Official Download Chart. Ms Goulding also performed the song during Prince William and Kate Middleton's first dance at their wedding reception.\n\nJohn Lewis had another success in the same year with its spring campaign, which used a Fyfe Dangerfield cover of Billy Joel's She's Always A Woman.\n\nOften regarded as the best John Lewis Christmas advert, the song from 2011 was the lowest-ranking song on the charts out of all its peers. Amelia Warner, who goes by the stage name of Slow Moving Millie and is married to Fifty Shades of Grey actor Jamie Dornan, sung a cover of Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths. It peaked at number 31 in the official charts.\n\nGabrielle Aplin's cover of The Power of Love, released in 1984 by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, was the first John Lewis advert song to reach number one. It re-entered the top 100 the following Christmas following a seasonal surge in downloads.\n\nLily Allen got a second consecutive number one for the department store with her cover of Somewhere Only We Know, the 2004 indie ballad by Keane. Some of the proceeds from the single, which accompanied the animated tale of a bear and a hare, were donated to Save the Children's Philippine Typhoon Appeal campaign. Ms Allen later said she earned only \u00a38,000 from the song.\n\nJohn Lewis turned to the Beatles for the second time in 2014, having used a version of From Me To You in 2009. New indie singer-songwriter Tom Odell crooned a cover of Real Love, a John Lennon song that was reworked by the three remaining Beatles in 1995. Odell's version reached number seven in the charts.",

Brenda Hwang, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated.\n\nMs. Brooks, 28, is keeping her name. She is an associate specializing in retail law at Sedgwick, a law firm based in San Francisco. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received her law degree cum laude from the University of Michigan. She is a daughter of Kay U. Brooks of Granite Bay, Calif., and Albert L. Brooks of Roseville, Calif.\n\nThe groom, 29, is an associate at Exponent, an engineering and scientific consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He also graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the University of Michigan. He is a son of Karin Kimiecik and Kenneth Kimiecik Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nIn July 2010, Ms. Brooks began a solo backpacking journey that started in Arica, in northern Chile, where she was living with a Chilean family and volunteering as an English teacher at a local high school through a program offered by the Chilean Ministry of Education.\n\nWhile in Chile she also began filing online applications to various law schools in the United States. By the time her backpacking adventure took her to Nicaragua in January 2011, she was starting to hear back from various schools, and would travel to town once a week to look over her responses at an internet cafe.\n\nBy March, still in Nicaragua, she intensified her research on individual schools. But she found limited success getting individuals to send her feedback through postings she made Google and a travel website called Couchsurfing.com.\n\nSo she eventually hatched a plan to connect with both male and female students living in the college towns she was targeting: She figured that those she contacted through OkCupid would be more motivated to respond.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty good way to see what the people who could tell me about life at these schools were all about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site was also free of charge, so I didn\u2019t have to spend any money.\u201d\n\nShe said that she was not interested in finding romance, which is why Ms. Brooks did not initially put her photo on the dating site. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t getting much feedback that way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I eventually decided to use a photo of myself.\u201d\n\nWhen she began researching the University of Michigan, she filtered her search for current graduate students in Ann Arbor, which resulted in a 99 percent match with a guy whose profile obscured his face but who was clearly wearing a shirt from U.C. Berkeley, Ms. Brooks\u2019s alma mater.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a pretty darn clever idea,\u201d said Mr. Kimiecik, the mystery man in the shirt. \u201cI figured this is a person I should definitely help out.\u201d\n\nSo they began corresponding and became online friends.\n\n\u201cHe seemed like a pretty cool person, someone I looked forward to talking to,\u201d said Ms. Brooks, whose interactions with University of Michigan-based Mr. Kimiecik, eventually helped her choose to study law there. \u201cHe seemed warm and kind, but I didn\u2019t know what he looked like because all the photos of him were old and taken at odd angles. It was hard to see his face.\u201d\n\nA month later, Ms. Brooks returned from Nicaragua to her mother\u2019s home in Granite Bay to prepare for law school. Her online exchanges with Mr. Kimiecik were now replaced by phone calls and texting, \u201cand a little bit of flirting,\u201d according to Ms. Brooks.\n\nThe more they flirted, the more he grew interested.\n\n\u201cShe was charming and intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cI also found her to be a warmhearted, positive and perceptive person. I kept wanting to know more and more about her.\u201d\n\nDespite their regular communications, Ms. Brooks still did not know what Mr. Kimiecik looked like, so she asked him to post a more-recent photo. He replied by sending her a photo of himself wearing ski goggles and a ski jacket, which had a hood covering most of his face.\n\n\u201cI thought it was hilarious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also found it wildly frustrating.\u201d\n\nThough he explained the stunt as \u201ca partial joke,\u201d he added, \u201cMy usual reaction to first meeting someone is to keep them at arm\u2019s length before I start telling them my whole life story.\u201d\n\nShe finally got the chance to see him up close when she flew to Michigan, and he picked her up at the airport. Before meeting him at the baggage claim area, she rushed to the bathroom to apply some makeup.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t put stock in anything, but I was hopeful and I wanted to make a good first impression,\u201d she said.\n\nLike the kind of first impression Mr. Kimiecik made on her.\n\n\u201cHe was incredibly handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI was excited to finally be standing next to him.\u201d\n\nThey were soon dating and began living together in August 2012. In July 2013, he proposed to her at Point Reyes National Seashore in California, and when she returned to Granite Bay in February 2014 to begin studying for the bar exam, a 19-month long-distance relationship ensued.\n\nThey were reunited in September 2015, when Mr. Kimiecik, who had earned his Ph.D., went to San Francisco to join Ms. Brooks, who was already working at Sedgwick.\n\n\u201cOur long-distance relationship was reaffirming for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought back to all of those times I was on my own and didn\u2019t need him, but now I was on my own again, and this time I wanted to be with him. I really missed him.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on August 7, 2016, on page ST12 of the New York edition with the headline: The Man Behind the Mask.

        "text": "A FEW years ago \u2014 mid-2002 seems like another lifetime now \u2014 I was researching a book on Enron, and met a company executive for lunch. He was like so many people who worked there back in the good times: articulate, sophisticated, not just smart but astute about people in a way that would make the company's collapse all the more astounding when it occurred.\n\nThe most interesting piece of information he handed me was this: that he would much rather have been stranded on a desert island with Jeff Skilling, the company's brusque chief executive, than with Ken Lay, its well-liked founder. Up close, he promised, Jeff Skilling was good company; Ken Lay was not.\n\nThe jury that witnessed Mr. Lay's testimony last month and is now deliberating his and Mr. Skilling's fate on a combined 34 fraud charges might not be surprised by that assessment, but back then it was difficult to digest. I had been a Houstonian since 1976, and Ken Lay had emerged from the oil bust of the 80's as nothing less than a corporate visionary.\n\nEnron, for instance, was a groundbreaker in prohibiting smoking inside its shimmering high-rise office tower. So when you drove down Smith Street and caught sight of those nicotine addicts exiled to the sun-scorched pavement, the scene seemed to augur something new and advanced \u2014 a better way to live than that proffered by the old wildcatters who liked their whiskey, cigarettes and handshake deals.\n\nIf there was trouble among the colossal egos of local business leaders, Ken Lay brought them to the table and forced a compromise. If the African-American or arts community needed a hand, Ken Lay \u2014 and Enron \u2014 were there, insisting that a world-class city needed equal opportunity and edgy refinement to attract business, as opposed to bidness. When the Summit of Industrialized Nations was held here in 1990, Ken Lay was the man President George H. W. Bush tapped to make sure Houston put on a good show, and we did. The heat even broke.\n\nThat was the Early Ken Lay: the guy who knew what was best for you. Certain other facts \u2014 that Mr. Lay drank his coffee only from a particular kind of china cup, that he had a company plane's interior repainted during a layover because he didn't like the color, that in myriad ways he suggested that rules were for lesser beings \u2014 were all washed away in the sea of Enron's profits.\n\nOnce Enron imploded, we had to adjust to a different Ken Lay. The problem, former Enron executives explained, was that he didn't like to tell people no. Someone even told me, with a straight face, that Mr. Lay didn't have a head for business. Mr. Lay had been disengaged toward the end, they said \u2014 he wanted to be energy secretary, or work on a Middle East peace plan.\n\nSo Ken Lay held on to his public reputation as a good guy. It was assumed that the dark prince, Jeff Skilling, had played him.\n\nThen came the tsunami of news reports, investigations and books: the ones that described, in detail, the so-called Valhalla Incident, in which Mr. Lay in the 80's refused to punish two traders who had made illegal transactions because their revenues had saved the nascent company. The ones that contained accounts of all the executives who had warned him in vain that his company was in trouble, not just economically but morally. As we saw the embattled Mr. Lay on TV \u2014 on his way to church, carrying a Bible \u2014 we were left to wonder: is this man an idiot or a crook?\n\nBut if you sat in the courtroom during Mr. Lay's testimony, alas, you stopped asking yourself that question. For those who ascribe to the old saw holding that the personality of a company reflects the personality of the chief executive, well, the win-at-all-costs Ken Lay was there for all to see.\n\nAs one of his former executives, Mike Muckleroy, noted in his testimony, Mr. Lay tended to shade the truth under pressure as a businessman; and here Mr. Lay was, under pressure again, revealing the impatience, the imperiousness, the ungraceful eliding of unpleasant facts that matched the prosecution's earlier descriptions of his company.\n\nWhen the government lawyers showed evidence of his desperate attempts at self-preservation (tens of thousands of dollars in bills for antiquing trips and birthday parties while his company was tanking; announcing that he was buying more Enron stock while quietly selling $4 million worth), well, Ken Lay didn't look like a guy you'd want to be stranded on a desert island with, especially with one last coconut between you.\n\nAs the lead prosecutor, Sean Berkowitz, pointed out, the trial wasn't a litmus test of whether Ken Lay was a good person; it was about his character at Enron. Maybe Ken Lay will never be able to see himself for who he was, but by the time the jury took to their deliberations, most people in Houston felt they knew Ken Lay all too well.\n\nMimi Swartz, an executive editor of Texas Monthly, is the author, with Sherron Watkins, of \"Power Failure: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Enron.\"\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on , on page WK15 of the New York edition with the headline: The Three Faces of Ken Lay.

Scores of officers, traumatized and stung by the loss of so many comrades, turned to the chaplains for solace, guidance and a prayer. Father Romano, for one, spent 10 months at ground zero and accompanied the body of every recovered officer as it was carried out of the pit.\n\nPolice Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly says the stigma that once kept many officers from seeking out a chaplain, lest they be seen as frail, has largely faded since 9/11. \"The shock waves were huge throughout the entire department,\" he said. \"For the first time, people saw the organization as a big nurturing family and seeking help was no longer a sign of weakness.\"\n\nThe chaplains, on call 24 hours a day, reflect the department's increasing diversity: there is the Rev. Luis Serrano, a Hispanic Pentecostal minister, the Rev. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook, a black Baptist and the first female chaplain, and Iman Izak-El Mu'eed Pasha, the unit's first Muslim religious figure who recently retired. (His replacement is being sought).\n\nWith their standard-issue navy blues and lapels glinting with insignia, the chaplains are, at first glance, indistinguishable from the rank and file. But they do not carry weapons and wherever they go, they are swept up in the embrace of high-ranking commanders, pimple-faced cadets and civilian 911 operators.\n\n\"I'm not Jewish, but I want this guy to do my eulogy,\" Detective Stephen Giaco said jokingly after giving Rabbi Kass a hug in the Midtown North station house where he works. \"That's because he'll make me sound like a better person than I really am.\"\n\nChaplains have the power to pick up a phone, call a commanding officer and wrangle out a resolution to a personality clash.

And when it comes to the African-American community, sometimes I serve as a cultural translator.\"\n\nWith four decades on the force, Rabbi Kass is almost as recognizable around police headquarters as his boss, Commissioner Kelly. He is also a frequent presence at churches, mosques and Hindu temples. \"If there was an entry in Guinness Book of World Records for the rabbi who attended the most Catholic Masses, I would win hands down,\" he said with a boyish grin.\n\nRabbi Kass has had a colorful run: there were the death threats that earned his family months of round-the-clock security and a starring role in a hostage crisis that was resolved with a pastrami sandwich. Rabbi Kass persuaded the self-identified Jewish hostage-taker to exchange his guns for two Carnegie Deli sandwiches. Another mark of devotion to the job? He left his own son's bar mitzvah when he got word that an officer had been shot in the line of duty.\n\nAddressing a class of police academy students this week, the rabbi lectured the recruits about the lures of graft, the temptation to prejudge those of other ethnicities and, more profoundly, an officer's power to take away life.\n\n\"You are the only ones in society that can use lethal force,\" he said. \"None of you should ever shoot your gun lightly. And if you do, it should be done with great reluctance and sadness. It is when you shoot and not think twice, that you have lost your humanity.\"",

        "text": "Getting lapped by a bunch of week-old fish and failing to beat its predecessor\u2019s opening weekend numbers certainly seemed like enough to earn Independence Day: Resurgence the dreaded \u201cflop\u201d label after the big-budget movie\u2019s disappointing U.S. debut last weekend.\n\nBut, as we head into the holiday weekend with which the movie shares its name, the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day is actually well-positioned to easily top its reported production budget of $165 million with its overall worldwide box office gross, despite the fact that Resurgence failed to make much of a splash in its North American debut. The movie\u2014which comes 20 years after the original and brings back much of the original cast, minus megastar Will Smith\u2014made only $41.6 million domestically in its first weekend in theaters, falling well short of blocking Walt Disney\u2019s animated sequel Finding Dory ($73.2 million domestically) from claiming its second-straight weekend box-office title.\n\nEmbarrassingly, the domestic opening for Independence Day: Resurgence didn\u2019t even gross as much as the 1996 original\u2019s debut haul before taking ticket-price inflation into account (the first Independence Day opened to $50.2 million domestically, which becomes $97.5 million with inflation). Various publications have already happily labeled Resurgence a \u201cflop\u201d and a \u201cbomb,\u201d while critics have more or less panned the film, which currently has a 33% \u201cfresh rating\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes (compared to the original\u2019s 62% rating).\n\nThere is no doubt that Resurgence is a disappointment for 20th Century Fox, as well as for fans, but it is worth noting that the movie\u2019s unimpressive North American debut did not stop it from topping all movies last weekend in worldwide box office, thanks to a $102 million haul overseas, according to ComScore. That strong international debut gave Resurgence an overall opening gross of $143.7 million, which should allow the film to easily top $200 million in global box office after the upcoming holiday weekend (even if it sees a week two sales drop-off of more than 50%).\n\nNow, none of this erases the fact that Fox would have obviously preferred a much bigger domestic opening for Resurgence, especially with no major blockbusters likely to be among this weekend\u2019s new releases. (Disney\u2019s The BFG and Warner Bros\u2019 The Legend of Tarzan are the biggest names, but both could also fall short of Finding Dory, which is a summer powerhouse with almost $400 million in global box office over a couple of weeks.)\n\nA decent comparison for Resurgence is Terminator: Genisys, last year\u2019s disappointing franchise reboot from Viacom\u2019s Paramount, which didn\u2019t even crack $90 million in domestic box office but still made more than $350 million overseas. Terminator: Genisys was far from a glowing success, but it did surprisingly well in China, a booming movie market where Resurgence already made $37 million last week.\n\nResurgence is sure to fall well short of being the box-office behemoth its predecessor was in 1996\u2014when Independence Day made more than $300 million domestically, along with another $500 million overseas. But, the sequel should still ride a decent international box office gross to avoid becoming a financial disaster for Fox and maybe even shake off the \u201cflop\u201d label.",

        "text": "Since last Sunday, U.S. and Coalition forces have launched more than 125 airstrikes against targets in Iraq and Syria as part of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, killing at least 250 ISIS fighters and destroying ISIS training camps, weapons facilities, and fighting positions.\n\nAs important as the strikes were, they were not always led by the most senior officer participating. Instead, as the aircraft delivering ordinance screamed towards their objectives at speeds of 700 MPH, each strike was led by the best pilot for that mission, on that day, no matter his or her rank.\n\nIt is a concept that holds particular resonance for U.S. business, given the current demographic shift underway. About 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring daily, according to the Social Security Administration, a hemorrhaging of talent that will result in a large loss of institutional knowledge and leadership skills and will only get worse as more reach retirement age.\n\nAccording to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management, 36% of organizations have started to look specifically at how this demographic shift will impact their operations, and over half already run programs to transfer knowledge from older workers to younger workers.\n\nWhile these programs often take the form of mentoring and job-shadowing, the military might offer a more powerful model.\n\nAmongst fighter pilots in the U.S. and Israel (which is not participating in Operation Inherent Resolve), determining which pilot will be in charge of a mission is not purely determined by seniority. Rather, it comes down to an assessment of who is best at the skills required for each mission.\n\nNot only does this system demonstrate the value of assigning people to a task based on their experience and expertise, it also offers younger officers crucial management and leadership skills via experiential learning. \u201cThis is a great opportunity to develop future leaders on the job,\u201d said Dr. Homa Bahrami, senior lecturer at the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\n\nIn this system, the responsibility for leading a flight extends to the mission briefing and debriefing. In these meetings, pilots\u2014sometimes as young as 24 or 25 if they are First Lieutenants\u2014have to critically evaluate their superior officers, who can hold ranks up to General.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a religious ritual, the debriefing,\u201d said Brigadier General Uri Oron, head of Israeli Air Force Intelligence, during a U.S. tour with the Israeli Air Force Center Foundation. Most of the time, he said, younger officers lead the missions on which he flies.\n\n\u201cWhen the door closes on the flight debriefing, we have a saying that, \u2018The hats come off,\u2019\u201d said Major Jack Trombetta, an elite test pilot and U.S. combat veteran now based at Edwards Air Force Base. \u201cWe have our ranks on our hats, but your rank does not mean anything when you are in the flight room.\u201d\n\nSenior officers, like all pilots interviewed, greatly value these evaluations, and will sometimes even criticize their subordinates for not pointing out the errors they, the senior officers, committed. This kind of leadership trickles down, Trombetta notes, as pilots will often self-identity mistakes they made. Beyond improving their abilities, pilots recognize the value of a culture that allows for an open exchange of ideas and a skills-based meritocracy.\n\nStarting in flight school, pilots are inculcated with the importance of being able to put their egos aside in the debriefing room, something that is not always so easy to do for men and women whose competitiveness is sacrosanct (and, in fact, selected for).\n\n\u201cThe hyper-competitiveness is there, it has to be, that understanding that you want to be better than everyone around you,\u201d said Trombetta. \u201cBut you prove how good you are in the airplane. You don\u2019t prove how good you are in the debrief.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of debriefings, which can last hours, is to review the mission and every pilot\u2019s performance. These reviews can be extremely granular in nature. Pilots can expect to have their every eye movement and hand placement analyzed, in particular during engagement with the enemy, on a second-by-second basis in some cases.\n\nBeyond analyzing performance during a dogfight or bombing run, debriefings also cover administrative phases of the flight, such as takeoff and landing, as well as safety issues. No one in the room is able to hide, and it is not always easy for the pilots to take the incisive criticism.\n\n\u201cInitially it is very tough. Many of us have lived a life where we are handled with kiddie gloves,\u201d said Trombetta. \u201cPeople say you should sandwich a criticism with two compliments. That is not something we do here.\u201d\n\nHaas lecturer Bahrami said that while some areas of the business landscape are employing management structures similar to the pilot culture\u2014notably software\u2014the trend is not as evident in areas like sales and marketing.\n\nBut as all companies navigate through digital transformation and more Millennials enter the workforce, Bahrami expects to see more of these progressive leadership structures emerge.\n\n\u201cHierarchical pyramids won\u2019t be sufficient in this much more volatile, complex world of today,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat brought you here won\u2019t get you there.\u201d\n\nFor companies that want to implement these new management structures, Bahrami preaches a slow, methodical process, one which is outlined in an online course she wrote called \u201cAccelerating Change Readiness & Agility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would encourage businesses to thoughtfully experiment,\u201d she said, recommending short trials where, for example, someone is put in charge of a particular team and given a clear understanding of their responsibilities and the time-limited nature of the experiment.\n\n\u201cYou experiment, you escalate, and then you launch\u2014the mistake is to escalate way too prematurely,\u201d she said.\n\nBahrami has seen the benefits of this kind of progressive management structure throughout Silicon Valley, but cautions that it is very context-dependent. \u201cOne size does not fit all,\u201d she said.\n\nBut if this culture of openness, based on merit, can serve sectors as different as combat aviation and Silicon Valley, it might hold value for other industries that also want to draw out optimized team performance while developing young leaders.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we are as good as we are is we get all the lessons learned,\u201d said Trombetta. That\u2019s important in any industry, but vitally so in one where, as Trombetta notes, the main goal is to, \u201cKeep our guys alive and rain some hate on the enemy.\u201d",

Two or three very small details remain,\" Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said as he emerged Tuesday morning from all-night discussions with creditors.\n\nThe European Commission, a key negotiator in the talks, confirmed the progress. Annika Breidthardt, the Commission's spokeswoman for economic affairs, said the details were expected to be cleared up later in the day.\n\nDissenters in Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party, who want to end bailout talks and return to a national currency, promised to fight the deal, describing it as a \"noose around the neck of the Greek people.\"\n\nTsipras requested an end to the summer recess to allow for the two-day approval procedure and to get a vote before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Friday.\n\nThe agreement still requires approval from higher-level representatives, and senior finance officials from the 28 EU nations were holding a conference call Tuesday.\n\nGermany, the largest single contributor to Greece's two previous bailouts and among the toughest negotiators so far, remained cautious on the timing for a final deal. \"We will have to examine the results that come in the course of today,\" deputy finance minister Jens Spahn told n-tv television.\n\nInvestors cheered the news of progress.\n\nGreece's government borrowing rates fell on Tuesday, a sign investors are less worried about a default. The 2-year bond yield dropped by 4.2 percentage points to 14.73 percent. The Athens Stock Exchange, which reopened recently after being shut for five weeks during the most severe part of Greece's financial crisis closed up 2.1 percent.\n\nCash-strapped Greece needs more money by Aug. 20 at the latest, when it has a debt repayment of just over $3.3 billion to make to the European Central Bank.\n\nThe government insisted it has also gained key concessions from lenders: greater control over labor reforms, avoiding a \"fire sale\" of state assets, and softer deficit targets.\n\nIt said it had agreed to have a 0.25 percent government deficit this year and a 0.5 percent surplus next year, when not counting the cost of servicing debt. Those so-called primary surpluses would rise to 1.75 percent in 2017 and 3.5 percent in 2018.\n\nThe surpluses are more ambitious than those of many European countries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Spain, for example, is not expected to achieve a primary surplus before 2018. That's largely because the creditors want to make sure Greece is able to start paying off its debt load as soon as possible.\n\nThe government claims the creditors wanted even more ambitious surplus targets, and that the targets it agreed to mean it will be able to spare the country budget cuts worth about $22 billion.\n\n\"This practically means that with the current agreement there will be no fiscal burden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in other words new measures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the immediate future,\" the government said in a note.\n\nBanks will be strengthened with new cash infusions by the end of the year and will have an immediate boost of \"at least 10 billion euros,\" or $11 billion, it said. The government insists this means there is no longer any danger that the banks may have to raid bank deposits to restore their financial health.\n\nThe government also said that banks will not make repossessions and auctions of primary residences will not occur within 2015.\n\nGreece has relied on bailouts worth a total $263 billion from eurozone members states and the International Monetary Fund since concern over its high debts locked it out of bond markets in 2010. To secure the loans, successive governments have had to implement spending cuts, tax hikes and reforms.\n\nWhile the austerity has reduced budget overspending, the measures compounded a deep recession and pushed unemployment to a record high. Figures next week are expected to confirm that Greece's recession deepened in the second quarter.\n\nThough the government was elected on a staunchly anti-austerity platform in January, it has been forced into a policy U-turn after bailout talks came close to collapse last month.\n\nWhile Greece's parliament ratified further tax hikes and reforms, the rebellion by hardline Syriza lawmakers has left Tsipras' party with only a nominal parliamentary majority.\n\nThat has stoked speculation that Tsipras will call early elections after the bailout deal is signed. Tsipras still retains strong personal support in opinion polls, which show Syriza heading for a potentially big victory.",

And some change those categories every quarter. You\u2019ve got to be a spending ninja to maximize your payoff.\n\nBut let\u2019s not pick on cash-back cards. Many other rewards programs are just as tricky, with byzantine rules that tend to change regularly. No wonder only three in five rewards cardholders understand\u2014or think they know\u2014how their cards work, a J.D. Power survey found. And almost 20% of cardholders didn\u2019t redeem any rewards last year, NerdWallet reports.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t taking full advantage of the cards in your wallet, though, you could be walking away from hundreds of dollars a year. \u201cLots of consumers are costing themselves money by not understanding what their credit card does,\u201d says NerdWallet credit card expert Sean McQuay.\n\nNow is an especially good time to revisit your options.

Once again MONEY has teamed with NerdWallet, sifting through thousands of credit cards to identify 14 that are best in class. We\u2019ve highlighted outstanding options in five categories\u2014cards that offer cash back and travel rewards, specialized services for students and small businesses, and the best financing terms.\n\nMost of our picks assume you are using cards strategically to maximize rewards, and paying off your bill each month to avoid fees and finance charges. (Most also require good credit\u2014a score of roughly 700 or above.) Yet MONEY went one step further this year. At the top of each broad category is our \u201ceasy choice\u201d\u2014the best no-muss, no-fuss, no-annual-fee option. That\u2019s because while the benefits can be rich, maximizing rates and rewards is a lot of work\u2014and not for everyone.\n\nMONEY decided the criteria to consider\u2014including intro and regular APRs, sign-up bonuses, fees, and rewards\u2014and then set parameters for what constituted a winner in each category (for example, lowest rate and no annual fee for student borrowing). NerdWallet plugged those terms into its database and made several suggestions for each category; it disclosed to MONEY any issuers from which it receives compensation when people apply through its site. MONEY then independently fact-checked the results and made the final decisions.\n\nRead next: Find the Right Credit Card for You",

If nobody is afraid of me, I'm meaningless.\"\n\n\"Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle-dusters. If you think you can hurt me more than I can hurt you, try. There is no way you can govern a Chinese society.\"\n\n\"If you are a troublemaker... it's our job to politically destroy you... Everybody knows that in my bag I have a hatchet, and a very sharp one. You take me on, I take my hatchet, we meet in the cul-de-sac.\"\n\n\"You take a poll of any people. What is it they want? The right to write an editorial as you like? They want homes, medicine, jobs, schools.\"\n\n\"We have to lock up people, without trial, whether they are communists, whether they are language chauvinists, whether they are religious extremists. If you don't do that, the country would be in ruins.\"\n\n\"If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society... So what happens? There will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation. That's a problem.\"\n\n\"You know, the cure for all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government. You get that alternative and you'll never put Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again... and your asset values will be in peril, your security will be at risk and our women will become maids in other people's countries, foreign workers.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call myself an atheist. I neither deny nor accept that there is a God. So I do not laugh at people who believe in God. But I do not necessarily believe in God - nor deny that there could be one.\"\n\n\"Without her, I would be a different man, with a different life... I should find solace in her 89 years of a life well lived. But at this moment of the final parting, my heart is heavy with sorrow and grief.\"\n\n\"There is an end to everything and I want mine to come as quickly and painlessly as possible, not with me incapacitated, half in coma in bed and with a tube going into my nostrils and down to my stomach.\"\n\n\"Even from my sickbed, even if you are going to lower me to the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up.\"\n\nPeople pay tribute outside the Singapore General Hospital where elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBarack Obama said after meeting the still-healthy Mr Lee at the White House in October 2009 that \u201cthis is one of the legendary figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries\u201d.\n\nHe had set Singapore on a path that has seen average incomes rise 100 times, with investments across the globe, a widely respected civil service and world-class infrastructure.\n\nBut he was criticised for his iron-fisted rule, forcing several opposition politicians into bankruptcy or exile, and once invoked Machiavelli in declaring: \u201cIf nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless.\u201d\n\nMr Lee\u2019s political career spanned 30 years as premier and 20 years as senior government adviser.\n\nBut in his last years, he was a shadow of his old self as his health deteriorated following his beloved wife\u2019s death in October 2010.\n\nHe remained revered by many but also became the target of scathing attacks in social media as some Singaporeans began to muster the courage to speak out against him and the political and social model he had bequeathed.\n\nThe statement from the Prime Minister's Office that was posted on Facebook\n\nHis impact, through his policies and via his son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is likely to be felt for years to come.\n\nLee Kuan Yew first became prime minister after Britain granted Singapore self-rule in 1959 prior to its stormy post-colonial union with Malaysia.\n\nBorn to a 20-year-old father whom he described as a \u201crich man\u2019s son, with little to show for himself\u201d and a 16-year-old bride in an arranged marriage, Mr Lee grew up thinking British colonial rulers were invincible.\n\nHe had a rude awakening during World War II after Japanese invaders easily overran British forces and took over Singapore in 1942, shattering the myth of European supremacy in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe dark ages had descended on us. It was brutal, cruel,\u201d Mr Lee said of the Japanese occupation, calling it \u201cthe biggest single political education of my life because, for three and a half years, I saw the meaning of power\u201d.\n\nMr Lee survived massacres of civilians and at one point worked for Japanese propaganda. After liberation, he left to study law at Cambridge, where he secretly wed his classmate Kwa Geok Choo before returning home in 1950.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shares a toast with Singapore's then Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in 2006 (AP)\n\nHe was shaken by Kwa\u2019s passing after more than 60 years of marriage and admitted that \u201cat this moment of the final parting, my heart is heavy with sorrow and grief\u201d.\n\nThey had three children, the oldest of whom is Lee Hsien Loong. Daughter Lee Wei Ling became a doctor, and son Lee Hsien Yang became a top corporate figure.\n\nMr Lee stepped down as prime minister in 1990 and handed power to his deputy Goh Chok Tong, who in turn gave way to the veteran leader\u2019s elder son in 2004.\n\nIn 2011, he stepped down as a cabinet adviser after the ruling People\u2019s Action Party suffered its worst performance yet in a general election, its share of the vote falling to a low of 60 percent.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office said arrangements for the public to pay respects and funeral arrangements will be announced later.",

Scott and others used falsified documents, including claims that the buyers planned to live in the condos.\n\nThe buyers were told they wouldn\u2019t have to put their own money into the investments, that the mortgages would be covered by rents, and that they would share in the profits on the properties.\n\nThey soon learned that what seemed too good to be true was, indeed, just that. Their experience was detailed in a Boston Globe investigation in 2009.\n\nA real estate broker involved in the scheme, Joan Ruggiero, 78, last week was sentenced to nine months in prison and nine months of home detention for her role in what the government called a conspiracy to defraud mortgage lenders of $4 million on more than two dozen properties in Dorchester.\n\nShe also was ordered to pay a fine of $100,000 and restitution of $4.1 million to the lenders. Ruggiero pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy in 2013.\n\nIn October, a lawyer involved in the fraud, Michael R. Anderson, 46, of Framingham, was sentenced to two years in prison and two years of supervised release. He also was ordered to pay $11 million in restitution and to forfeit $7.4 million.\n\nAnderson, who was involved in preparing loan closing documents, in 2011 had pleaded guilty to 16 counts of wire fraud, nine counts of bank fraud, and two counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.\n\nOthers who prosecutors said helped Scott in his scheme, Jerrold Fowler and Thursa Raetz, both of Norfolk, Va., each pleaded guilty to wire fraud.\n\nScott has been jailed since March 2014 on separate charges for allegedly defrauding a couple of nearly $200,000 on real estate transactions. That arrest took place after he had relinquished his real estate broker\u2019s license.",

And a lot more change is on the way, prompting the discount retailer to invite Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz this week to come rally the Target troops.\n\nAround this time in 2014, Target parted ways with former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, reeling from a devastating data breach a few months earlier, seeing its results brought low because of an ill-advised, now abandoned expansion into Canada, and having lost its ability to dazzle customers with the cheap chic ethos that had made it the third largest U.S. retailer.\n\nMany have blamed that low point on what was seen as the 54-year old retailer\u2019s bureaucratic, insular culture, one where teams were focused on meeting their numbers rather than what was best for the company overall. The result was the loss, at least partial anyway, of Target\u2019s magic touch: the ability to be a discounter that offered middle class customers cool, stylish items in addition to the basics one would come to a general merchandise retailer for. This was after all, the retailer that had brought you Michael Graves home goods, and Isaac Mizrachi clothes on top of toilet paper.\n\nBut Target lost its way, focusing on low prices during the recession to compete with Walmart wmt and not enough on the cool merchandise core to its customer proposition. It was also resistant to change, a very dangerous stance at a time of upheaval in retail, and slow to embrace how tech was changing shopping.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it may be because Starbucks sbux underwent a similar traumatic time in the preceding decade. The coffee chain had over-expanded its fleet, become a bloated bureaucracy and lost sight of what had made it work. And CEO Howard Schultz, who came back to the company in 2008 as it floundered, had a lot of advice on how to cope, and indeed thrive, under change to impart to workers at Target, where it has cafes at 1,300 stores in a partnership that goes back to 1999.\n\n\u201cOur brand comes to life by uplifting our people. So when I stopped hearing my team having conversations about the people and the coffee, and only focusing on the numbers and getting bigger, faster \u2026 that\u2019s when I realized something was wrong,\u201d Schultz told Target workers this week as part of series of talks from leading industry figures on innovation.\n\nTarget has made a lot of progress in the last two years. Under the leadership of Brian Cornell, Target has redoubled its efforts on the digital front, yielding 31% e-commerce growth last year and helping it begin to bridge the gap with rivals like Amazon amzn and Walmart. And it comparable sales have grown faster than Walmart\u2019s for several quarters now.\n\nTo foster innovation, Target is supporting a retail tech accelerate program with Techstars, while on the merchandise front, the retailer has landed collaborations with cool brands likes of Lilly Pulitzer and Marimekko. It is also working with MIT on an urban farming project, and testing out far out store concepts in Los Angeles. Some of that has been painful too: under Cornell, thousands of jobs at headquarters have been cut to reduce bureaucracy and make Target more nimble, and there have been many changes at the retailer\u2019s top echelons. Target last year also ditched in Canada and sold off its pharmacy business to CVS Health. cvs .\n\nStarbucks, meanwhile, has to continued to innovate, developing the most successful app in retail and hospitality, one that is behind 21% of U.S. sales. The coffee company offers mobile offering, putting it leap years ahead of pretty much any competitor. Last year, Starbucks\u2019 global revenues hit an all time high of $19 billion.\n\nSchultz told the Target audience that focusing on the basics was the key to the Starbucks\u2019 renaissance. \u201cFor the Starbucks team, it all comes back to one person, one cup, one community, and getting the details right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed to get back to basics, the values that our customers fell in love with in the first place.\u201d",

The article below was originally published at entrepreneur.com.\n\nThere was a time when knowing how to program was for the geekiest of geeks. That\u2019s not exactly the case today. As most entrepreneurs, freelancers and marketers will tell you, learning how to program can help you succeed. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been learning to code. It\u2019s helped me to become a much better entrepreneur\u2014I can dive in when my team needs to fix a few bugs on the site.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to shell out a ton of money or put yourself in debt to learn how to code, either. These 12 places offer coding courses for free:\n\nOne of the most popular free places to learn coding is CodeAcademy. In fact, more than 24 million people have already learned how to code through this educational company\u2019s engaging experience. At CodeAcademy, you can dive right in and take courses that teach you everything from HTML & CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Python and Ruby.\n\nFounded in 2012, Coursera has grown into a major for-profit educational-technology company that has offered more than 1,000 courses from 119 institutions. While you can pay for certain programs to receive a certificate, there are a number of free introductory programming courses in various specializations from universities such as the University of Washington, Stanford, the University of Toronto and Vanderbilt.\n\nEdX is another leading online-learning platform that is open source instead of for-profit. It was founded by Harvard University and MIT in 2012, so you know that you\u2019ll learn about cutting-edge technologies and theories. Today, edX includes 60 schools. You probably can\u2019t go wrong with the free Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard University.\n\nFounded in 2010, Udemy is an online learning platform that can be used as a way to improve or learn job skills. While there are courses you have to pay for, there are plenty of free programming courses, which are taught via video lessons, such as Programming for Entrepreneurs \u2013 HTML & CSS or Introduction to Python Programming.\n\nAGupieWare is an independent app developer that surveyed computer-science programs from some of the leading institutions in the U.S. It then created a similar curriculum based on the free courses offered by Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley and Columbia. The program was then broken into 15 courses: three introductory classes, seven core classes and five electives.\n\nWhile you won\u2019t actually receive credit, it\u2019s a perfect introductory program for prospective computer programmers.\n\nSometimes, you need to recall a reference book when you\u2019re stuck on a problem. That\u2019s GitHub. You can find more than 500 free programming books that cover more than 80 different programming languages on the popular web-based Git repository hosting service, which means that it\u2019s frequently updated by collaborators.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already learned the basics, and went to get into something a bit heavier\u2014such as exploring the theory behind coding\u2014take advantage of MIT\u2019s free courseware site that includes classes such as Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, Introduction to Programming in Java and Practical Programming in C.\n\nThis is a community of developers, which include some high-profile developers such as Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent. There, you can perfect your programming skills by learning from some of the leading developers in the world.\n\nBased out of New Zealand, Code Avengers provides fun and interactive programming courses that will teach you how to code games, apps and web sites using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Each course takes just 12 hours to complete and is available in English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Turkish and Portuguese.\n\nCreated in 2006 by educator Salman Khan, Khan Academy is one of the original free online-learning institutions. With step-by-step video tutorials, you can learn how to program drawings, animations and games using JavaScript and ProcessingJS, or learn how to create webpages with HTML and CSS.\n\nHere you\u2019ll learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Databases, DevTools, Node.js, Angular.js and Agile by networking and joining a community of professionals and students. You\u2019ll even work together on your coding skills so that you can build apps for free. Here\u2019s the catch: you\u2019re learning those skills and building helps to help solve real-world problems. Code is available to nonprofits.\n\nThis Google project launched in 2010 to counter Apple\u2019s HTML5. The site is full of tutorials, resources and the latest HTML5 updates. It\u2019s open source, so developers can play around with HTML5 code. Because this is more advanced than most introductory courses, you may want to gain some knowledge and experience before jumping in.\n\nLearning code used to require access to expensive books and classes, but no longer. I highly recommend that every entrepreneur learns to code. Still wondering if you need to code? Here is a programmer guide I put together to show you every step I took to become an entrepreneur that codes!\n\nTeach Yourself Coding on Your Own Time With These Resources\n\nGitHub Is Said to Hit $2 Billion Valuation With New Investment Round\n\nWant to Take Your Business to the Next Level?

But concerns are emerging over the devices\u2019 safety, with a particular focus on their electrical systems.\n\nOne of the most aggressive moves yet to clamp down on hoverboards has come from the United Kingdom, where officials announced Thursday they have detained 15,000 of the devices due to \u201cmajor safety risks\u201d related to their electrical systems.\n\nMany of the Segway-like scooters were found to have non-compliant plugs without fuses, which could cause the device to overheat, explode, or catch fire, according to the U.K.\u2019s National Trading Standards group. Officials have seen a significant spike in the number of these devices arriving in the U.K. recently, likely due to the holiday shopping season.\n\nAll this comes amid a number of incidents concerning hoverboards\u2019 safety elsewhere in the world. On Tuesday, an NBC News local affiliate reported that an exploding self-balancing scooter caused a house fire in Louisiana. Meanwhile, some cities, including New York, consider the devices unsafe for use on busy urban sidewalks.\n\nMore than 20 companies, many of which are located in China, manufacture and sell these scooters.

        "text": "It\u2019s undeniable that Salesforce, the San Francisco software company, has transformed how companies in industries as diverse as financial services and higher education manage their customer relationships. Now it\u2019s bringing its cloud-based technology to the world of healthcare.\n\nSalesforce CRM announced on Wednesday a new patient relationship management platform that it calls Salesforce Health Cloud. The product is part of the company\u2019s new push to change how doctors and healthcare providers effectively manage the health of patients across caregiver networks.\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud combines data from multiple sources\u2014electronic medical records, medical devices, even wearables\u2014into a single location. The idea? By having all the information in one place, health workers will have a more complete view of the patient and, in turn, be able to make smarter care decisions, intervene earlier if issues arise, and collect data along the way for effective treatments. The software also puts that information in the hands of the patient through mobile applications.\n\n\u201cWhat gets measured, gets improved,\u201d says Joshua Newman, doctor and chief medical officer for Salesforce\u2019s Healthcare and Life Sciences division. \u201cWith everything in one place, now you can see what really affects outcomes. Is it a phone call? A text message? We haven\u2019t had that data before. The things that every business in America thinks about every single day that have never been in healthcare before and are now being brought in by demand.\u201d\n\nA common goal among recently introduced healthcare technologies is the improvement of the patient experience. For example, the industry is transitioning away from a pay-per-service model and toward holistic, outcomes-based reimbursements. Medical offices know that they need to provide more comprehensive care to stay relevant. A first step is collating all of a patient\u2019s pertinent information, regardless of where the care took place.\n\nThat\u2019s where Salesforce Health Cloud steps in. The company is working with leading software vendors and systems integrators to tie together existing medical IT systems and layer on Salesforce\u2019s trademark customization.\n\nThe challenge with healthcare IT is that most information is stuck in proprietary software silos, hindering the ability to interact across the care spectrum. About 95% of healthcare providers say interoperability challenges limit their ability to transfer data from one medical center to another, according to a study by healthcare alliance Premier. That leaves dangerous gaps in care as information trickles through various IT systems.\n\nConsider a patient who visits an urgent care center for a cough that at first seems benign. The doctor on duty may not know that the patient visited two weeks ago for the same cough and noted shortness of breath during his last physical. If all that information were fed into a single database, a pattern would emerge and\u2014with hope\u2014lead to better diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\u201cHealthcare providers face a significant challenge. To deliver the best patient care possible, they rely on data sitting in multiple systems,\u201d says Ross Mason, founder of billion-dollar software startup MuleSoft, which is working with Salesforce to integrate outside data into the platform. \u201cConnectivity is the key to unlocking this data and making it useful.\u201d\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud has been in development with several health and medical device companies to date, including Centura Health in Colorado, Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, and the University of California, San Francisco. The platform begins previews today and will officially launch in February. Salesforce said it will release pricing for the service at that time.\n\nWith hope, Salesforce Health Cloud can bridge the gap and provide a place where various health care providers can interact, including case managers, doctors, nurses, caregivers, and insurance coordinators. It\u2019s a massive task\u2014one that puts the cloud company in league with health companies like Athenahealth ATHN and other more-targeted firms like Cardinal Health\u2019s naviHealth CAH , which focuses on post-acute care coordination.\n\nSign up for Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter about the business of technology.\n\nFor more Fortune health coverage, watch this video:",

        "text": "Do you punish your children when they\u2019re caught in a lie? That\u2019s what many parents do, but a new study from researchers at McGill University suggests it might be time for a different approach. The study finds that kids reprimanded for lying are more likely to bend the truth, while kids who are given a moral reason for truth-telling tend to believe that honesty is the best policy.\n\nResearchers traced the effectiveness of punishment in 372 kids between the ages of 4 and 8, finding that children were less likely to tell the truth when threatened with punishment, and more likely to tell the truth when they thought it would please an adult.\n\nIn order to gauge the implications of punishment on a child\u2019s propensity to lie, researchers placed each participant alone in a room with a toy, and asked the child not to peek at the toy for an entire minute. It\u2019s hardly surprising that curiosity got the best of most children, with 67.5 percent peeking, and 66.5 percent of those who peeked going on to lie about it. (Note: older children were less likely to peek, but were also more likely to lie about peeking after they\u2019d done so.)\n\n\u201cChildren often lie to conceal transgressions,\u201d says study researcher and McGill professor Victoria Talwar. \u201cHaving done something wrong or broken a rule, they may choose to lie to try to conceal it. After all, they know they may get in trouble for the transgression. Thus, punishment doesn\u2019t have much of an effect. It doesn\u2019t deter them from using the strategy of lying to try to get out of trouble.\u201d\n\nSo, how should parents go about encouraging their children to tell the truth when the impulse to lie is so strong? McGill\u2019s study indicates that kids respond best to a strong moral appeal for honesty. Younger children were inclined to tell the truth to make an adult happy, while older children were inclined to do so because of their own internalized definition of right and wrong \u2013\u2013 facts that might come in handy when your little one is caught red handed with the leftover Halloween candy.\n\n\u201cThreats about punishment are not deterrents for lying, and they do not communicate why children should be honest,\u201d says Talwar. \u201cIf a child is playing with a ball in the house and breaks your vase but tells the truth about it when asked, you should recognize that he came clean. He may still have consequences for his transgression, but the child learns that honesty is valued.\u201d\n\nThese findings reinforce a more progressive approach to parenting, and indicate that it\u2019s better to explain truth-telling to children using positive reinforcement than the threat of harsh consequences. \u201cGlobally, we generally think of lying as a negative behavior,\u201d says Talwar. \u201cHowever, we sometimes fail to recognize the positive behavior \u2013\u2013 honesty. If a child is confessing his transgression, we need to recognize that he was honest.\u201d\n\nRead next: Parents Should Try Being Present Instead of Perfect",

The latest numbers for 2014-2015 indicate that women made up just 27% of all creators, directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and directors of photography working on broadcast network shows.\n\nBroaden that to include cable and other sources and the number gets even grimmer: women accounted for 25% of those working on network, cable, and Netflix shows. This represents no change from last year\u2014and an increase of just 6% from the first study in 1997-1998.\n\nWomen\u2019s representation in front of the camera is a bit better. The report, which looked at sampling of network, basic and pay cable (A&E, AMC, FX, History, TNT, USA, HBO and Showtime) and Netflix shows, found that 42% of all speaking roles and 42% of major characters were female.\n\nHollywood\u2019s ageism double standard is also evident in the results. Most female characters are in their 20s and 30s (60%) whereas most male characters are in their 30s and 40s (55%). And opportunities plummet for older actresses (not to mention older audience members looking to see themselves reflected onscreen). Thirty-one percent of female characters were in their 30s, 18% were in their 40s, and just 2% were in their 60s or older.\n\nMinorities have an even greater challenge: 77% of female characters were white, 15% were African-American, 3% were Latina, 4% were Asian, and 1% were of \u201csome other\u201d race or ethnicity.\n\nThe good news is that when women do have key creative roles, they are more likely to create more opportunities for women. On network shows with at least one female creator, women comprised 50% of writers\u2014whereas women made up 15% of writers on shows with no female creators. On programs with at least one female executive producer, an average 43% of major characters were female. Compare that to shows no female executive producers, where an average 37% of characters were female.\n\nSince HBO\u2019s Project Greenlight premiere on Sunday, Matt Damon has been getting flack for interrupting Effie Brown, the one African-American female producer on the show, to say that selecting a diverse directing team isn\u2019t the solution to getting better representation of women and minorities on screen. But this report suggests otherwise.\n\nSays Dr. Martha Lauzen, author of the study, \u201cThe findings suggest that creators and executive producers play an instrumental role in shifting the gender dynamics for both on-screen characters and other individuals working in powerful behind-the-scenes roles.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.",

This simple yet powerful act is called \u201cPassing the Gift.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Heifer educates communities on how to manage their water resources, supports small-scale farmers, and empowers women by helping them become more self-sufficient.\n\nAt the helm of Heifer\u2019s efforts, is President and CEO Pierre Ferrari. Born in the Belgian Congo (today called the Democratic Republic of Congo), Ferrari assumed leadership of Heifer in 2010, bringing more than 40 years of business experience to an organization which celebrated its 70th anniversary this year.\n\nHere, Ferrari shares his passion for the work and explains how the women of the world have inspired him.\n\nWhat do you most want people to know?\n\nThat the poor are not responsible for their poverty and misery. Most of them struggle in conditions that are subhuman, dangerous, full of disease, hunger and despair. But when Heifer International offers a sliver of hope, they grab it with astounding energy, enthusiasm, creativity and optimism. Heifer approaches farmers who are eager and who we know will rapidly strive toward self-reliance and autonomy. We are there to help them do; we don't do it for them.\n\nWhat motivated you to get involved in this work?\n\nOne of my earliest ambitions was to work in development. I had planned to work at the World Bank after getting my MBA, but it didn\u2019t work out that way. I spent 20 plus years in corporate business, but the pull to engage in social issues finally got me to leave Coca-Cola and join CARE in the mid \u201990s. I then worked in a variety of ways that were mostly oriented to development of distressed communities.\n\nI think both my mother and grandmother influenced me deeply towards this work. My grandmother had a wholesale and retail vegetable business in Elizabethville (now Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo), working with local African farmers to produce the goods she needed for her trade. I remember going to the villages and buying the produce they had grown at her request, and the importance this trade had on their livelihoods and health. It felt like good and important work. They adored her.\n\nWho or what has made the greatest impression on you during your involvement?\n\nAll over the world I come across women who take on leadership roles with energy, vision and great engagement. It is really inspiring. They push me to help more, to move faster, and to support their efforts as they drive to end despair, poverty, hunger, abuse and more. They can leverage our help one hundredfold. They focus on their families and their communities.\n\nWhat have you been most surprised to learn?\n\nThe depth of passion my colleagues and others in the sector have to help others. It is a commitment for life -- and to life -- for so many. The work is hard and sometimes frustrating, but it\u2019s shouldered with great joy and hope.\n\nWhat has been the hardest part of this work, or how has it most challenged you?\n\nDevelopment is hard work, and one needs to be patient. Changes only come when the individuals, families and communities decide for themselves that it is time to radically change their own reality. Internal change is hard. It takes patience, and I am not a patient person, but I am learning.\n\nHow has this work changed you?\n\nThis work has deepened my study of systems, networks, complexity and human motivation. Finding the places where systems can be changed in the most fundamental ways, is important. Becoming more of an activist and an advocate for changes in systems (economic and political) that are responsible for exploitation and maintaining the status quo at the expense of the poor; and channeling resources to combat that exploitation, is exhilarating.\n\nWhat goal do you have for the next 12 months?\n\nAll of us at Heifer have been implementing substantial changes in our way of working in the world. We have scaled up our work as demanded by our partners in the field. We have installed systems that are making us more efficient and effective, and we are raising needed resources in a more balanced way to ensure our stability and impact. Now we will take advantage of all these improvements to help the communities and women with whom we work accelerate their escape from poverty and hunger.\n\nFor more information and inspiration visit MariaShriver.com",

Five couples living nearby told the court how their first reaction on hearing bangs, screams or cries was to verify what they heard with the person next to them.\n\n7) The trigger of the gun Pistorius fired had to be pulled four separate times to fire the four shots, suggesting a conscious action.\n\n8) He could not explain how he never heard or saw Steenkamp leave the bed to go to the lavatory moments before he started shooting into the door, despite her being just feet away from him.\n\n9) Pistorius said Steenkamp never responded to his instructions to call the police, or made a sound as she hid in the lavatory. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said this was \"impossible\" to believe.\n\n10) Witness Dr Johan Stipp told the court he saw a light on in Pistorius' bathroom when he heard shots fired; the athlete said he was \"too scared\" to switch the lights on until after the shooting.\n\n1) Pistorius had a heightened fear of intruders because his family had been victims of crime many times before, and this made him react more dramatically to a perceived threat.\n\n2) The athlete felt especially vulnerable because he did not have his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots. A psychologist said his reaction might seem \u201cextraordinary\u201d for an able-bodied person, but could be explained by his disability. The Paralympians\u2019 team doctor said disabled people often exhibited more dramatic \u201cfight-flight\u201d responses, and Pistorius would have chosen to fight since he was unable to flee.\n\n3) Pistorius suffered from a Generalised Anxiety Disorder, a psychiatrist who evaluated him found, which along with his disability may have made him react more extremely to a perceived threat.\n\n4) Pistorius fought to save Steenkamp's life and was, witnesses said, distraught by what had happened.\n\n5) The state presented scant evidence of the row they say prompted the shooting, through witness testimony or communication between the couple. The majority of Steenkamp's WhatsApp messages reflect that she was happy with the athlete. She also wrote him a Valentine's card in which she revealed she was in love with him.\n\nOscar Pistorius listens to evidence in court (AP)\n\n6) Sound tests conducted by the defence showed Pistorius screamed like a woman when he was anxious, his lawyer Barry Roux said, explaining the \"woman's screams\" neighbours heard.\n\n7) Both prosecution and defence accept there were two sets of bangs: the gunshots and Pistorius later breaking down the door with a cricket bat when he realised Steenkamp was in the lavatory. Sound tests suggested the two sounded very similar. The gunshots neighbours thought they heard might have been Pistorius breaking down the lavatory door.\n\n8) Neighbours who heard a woman screaming only heard one set of bangs; the timings of phone calls to estate security made by those witnesses, and Pistorius' phone calls to the estate manager and friends after he broke down the door, suggest they didn't hear the gunshots, only Pistorius screaming for help and the second set of bangs from the cricket bat.\n\n9) Police contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective clothing, moving key exhibits and walking over the lavatory door.\n\n10) Prosecutors decided to charge Pistorius with premeditated murder when they believed he took time to put on his prosthetic legs before firing the fatal shots. State forensic experts later agreed with the defence assertion that Pistorius did not have his legs on when he fired the shots.",

        "text": "The commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military must have the sound judgment to know when to use America\u2019s military power and, just as important, when not to use that power.\n\nTo his credit, President Barack Obama has displayed throughout his presidency an instinctive reticence to launch military strikes. The most disastrous foreign policy decisions during the Obama years as commander in chief occurred when he trusted the advice of others over his own instincts.\n\nWhile President Obama agonized over whether to use force to overthrow Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, it was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s impassioned and persistent arguments in favor of military action against Gaddafi that tipped the scales in what has been described as a very close 51-49 Obama decision to use force.\n\nFive years later, President Obama describes Libya as \u201ca mess.\u201d A failed state, Libya is now a haven for terrorist organizations including ISIS fighting for control of the country.\n\nIn Syria, where Secretary Clinton has repeated her advocacy of military intervention to overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad, President Obama is roundly criticized for having drawn a \u201cred line\u201d in the sand\u2014threatening that the U.S. would bomb Syria if Assad were to use chemical weapons against the Syrian people\u2014and then failing to follow through on that threat a year later when it was reported that Assad had in fact used chemical weapons on his own people.\n\nIronically, it took tremendous courage and character for President Obama to back down on his threat to launch a military attack on Syria. There should never have been a \u201cred line\u201d drawn, but after it was drawn and then crossed, there were but two choices: launch a bombing campaign against Syria or back down and endure harsh criticism both at home and overseas.\n\nThe decision to not create yet another completely failed state in the Middle East and open the door to a takeover of all of Syria by ISIS and other terrorist organizations is one that some say may have cost him credibility, but I believe it may have been one of President Obama\u2019s finest moments as commander in chief.\n\nThis episode in Syria underscores a pivotal decision we as a nation must make when choosing our next commander in chief: Will we elect a president who has the judgment and foresight to refuse to be drawn into unnecessary and counter-productive wars of regime change? Or will we elect a president eager to intervene in other countries and cavalierly use U.S. military power to overthrow foreign leaders we don\u2019t like?\n\nThis is not to say that we should be anything other than strong and determined to do what it takes to defeat those who wage war against America. But at this time in American history, we need a commander in chief who has the courage to reject the flawed and wasteful foreign policy of interventionism, regime change and unnecessary war.\n\nI\u2019ve endorsed Bernie Sanders to be our next president and commander in chief because I\u2019m convinced he is the only person running for president who has the intelligence, foresight and good judgment to make sound decisions when it comes to the issue of war and peace.\n\nWe need a commander in chief who will end the illegal and counter-productive war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad. Sanders has promised that as President he will end that war in Syria and focus on defeating those who threaten our safety\u2014groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. In contrast, Clinton favors an escalation of that war and advocates a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d in Syria that would cost billions of dollars, require tens of thousands of ground troops and a massive U.S. air presence, while also risking a head-to-head confrontation with Russia.\n\nSimilarly, while Sanders understands the need to defeat al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist organizations that attacked America on 9/11 and who continue to wage war against us, he has made it clear that he will not waste American treasure and lives on interventionist wars of regime change and so-called nation building.\n\nIn both Clinton\u2019s record and her campaign rhetoric, she has made it clear she will do the opposite\u2014that she favors a continuation of the counter-productive and horribly expensive foreign policy of intervention and regime-change.\n\nIn this election, we have an opportunity to express our national will. Who are we as a nation? Where are we headed? What kind of world do we want to leave for our children and their children?\n\nWe could vote for Clinton and continue to spend trillions of dollars on interventionist regime-change wars and so-called nation-building overseas. Or we could vote for Sanders, end these costly, counter-productive wars and use our precious taxpayer dollars to rebuild our own nation.\n\nThe choice in this election could not be more clear.",

        "text": "Quo Vadis, Senator Bernie Sanders? For months Sanders has scored higher in the national polls against Donald Trump, than Hillary Clinton, highlighting some of her drawbacks for the November showdown. Yet, with one primary to go next Tuesday in the colony known as the District of Columbia, the cries for him to drop out or be called a \u201cspoiler,\u201d are intensifying. Don\u2019t you understand that you have been vanquished by Hillary? You must endorse her to unify the party.\n\nNo, Bernie has other understandings beyond his principled declaration in speech after speech that his campaign is going all the way to the Democratic Party Convention. Between the June 14th D.C. Primary and the July nominating convention, lots can happen. As Yogi Berra said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d (The run-up to the primary is a perfect time for Sanders and Clinton to forcefully advocate for DC Statehood.)\n\nLike Trump, Hillary has imploding potential. Her email troubles are under Justice Department investigation and revelations are still bubbling. The smarm surrounding the Clinton quadrangle of Bill\u2019s huge speech fees, mining and other magnates securing concessions in foreign dictatorships, the role of the State Department and giant gifts to the Clinton Foundation continue to surface. Also intriguing is the fact that Hillary continues to stonewall any public disclosure of the transcripts, contractually in her exclusive possession, of her $5,000-per-minute, closed-door speeches to big banks and other industries.\n\nBut Bernie has other core reasons for not dissipating his bargaining power by descending to the bended-knee posture of a toady. He has to keep his supporters focused and hoping. The sure alternative, should he drop out, is a huge howl of outrage, followed by splintering of his voters\u2014some to Trump, others to Hillary, still others staying home in cynicism and withdrawal. Such chaos and rage will not be good for Hillary. She needs Bernie\u2019s voters in an electoral college, winner-take-all system.\n\nMaintaining the solidarity of Bernie\u2019s voters increases the seriousness with which his drive to change the rules, rigged against insurgents, in the Democratic Party, led by the unelected cronyism of the Superdelegates, comprising nearly 20% of the total delegates. Sanders\u2019s triad of protections for workers, students and patients, coupled with squeezing the unearned profits of Wall Street for a wide public works program, needs more visibility. Political Parties should be about serious subjects. Voters want to replace some of the tedious convention hoopla with some authenticity. Perhaps Senator Sanders could also urge Hillary Clinton to choose a running mate who would be more substantive and not just a tactical choice or an obeisant person. The pundits marvel at his ability to reject PAC money and raise millions from a large pool of small donors, with contributions averaging around $27\u2014self-imposed campaign finance reform. The Chattering Class should also be impressed with how strongly Sanders\u2019s message has resonated with the electorate.\n\nGranted, platforms have not been worth the paper they are written on. But that is because little in them is worth their paper. The Democratic Party\u2019s cautious monoculture had nothing to invoke as standards for subsequent political decision-making. Sanders brings political directions, often backed by a majority of the American people, that win or lose can become the legacy for a post-convention non-partisan citizen movement. Who better to expand the energy than this remarkable, uncharismatic, scandal-free Senator from a small, once safely Republican state?\n\nThere are still lessons that Sanders can teach the decadent corporate Democrats for whom this 2016 campaign may be their last hurrah. It is called political energy. It is the lack of political energy that explains why the Democratic Party, year after year, cannot defend the country from the worst Republican Party, on its own record, in Congressional history. It is political sectarianism that explains why the Democratic Party, with majoritarian issues at hand, has not landslided the Republican Party that votes for many bills which often register support under 30% in the polls. It is this absence of political energy, seduced by big money in politics, that the Sanders youth movement is aiming to topple. The Sanders people understand that breaking the momentum breaks the movement. That is why the longer range rebound of Bernie Sanders, right after Labor Day, must be mass non-partisan civic mobilization rallies driven by reforms and redirections that are for the people at large. That such class-levelling, peace-waging, freedom to participate in power for a more just society may benefit the Party\u2019s electoral prospects is a collateral benefit from a galvanizing civil society.\n\nBernie can start this fundamental movement for a functioning democracy with a massive rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and then take it regionally and locally. All along this march can make the faces of preventable injustice visible. New leaders to improve and deepen Bernie\u2019s agenda will step forward and the whole will become greater than the sum of its parts. Ready solutions for the good life and its possibilities will come off the shelves as people\u2014both left and right together\u2014begin to realize what is meant by our Constitution\u2019s sovereignty of the people over political and corporate rulers.\n\nThat a long-time, lone-ranger Senator can get this far is a tribute to his focus on widely-felt, repressed priorities. His candidacy is contrasted with the avarice of the plutocratic/oligarchic corporate state. This dominant corporatism possesses few loyalties to country and community other than to control them while treating the workers\u2019 economy with disinvestment and unbridled globalization.\n\nBoth Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower warned their fellow Americans about this subordination of our government to big business and its impact on our liberties and livelihoods.\n\nPerhaps the sonorous \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d call at Sanders\u2019s gigantic rallies around the country has its echoes in those similar warnings by these leaders\u2014one Democrat and one Republican\u2014coming from their experience during the Great Depression and World War II.",

Barnum of our age,\u201d Johnston said in a phone interview. During one of their meetings, Johnston deliberately said something wrong (about craps, natch) to see how his subject might respond. \u201cHe embraced my false fact in his answer,\u201d which taught Johnston, formerly a reporter at The Times and a Pulitzer Prize winner, something he hopes his readers will learn too: \u201cDonald doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\nWell, there are certain things Donald does know, Johnston admits. \u201cHe is masterful at understanding the conventions of journalism,\u201d and \u2014 perhaps relatedly \u2014 \u201cTrump is remarkably agile at doing as he chooses and getting away with it,\u201d which is how Johnston puts it in his book. \u201cThe Making of Donald Trump\u201d uses financial records, court documents and Trump\u2019s own declarations to trace the ascent of a man who \u201cpresents himself as a modern Midas even when much of what he touches turns to dross.\u201d Johnston wrote the book in 27 days, drawing his material from almost three decades of following Trump\u2019s career. \u201cHere are those dots,\u201d Johnston said about the glut of Trumpiana that is already out there. \u201cHere is how they connect,\u201d he said about his own book.\n\nBy becoming the Republican nominee, Trump has truly upped the ante \u2014 not just for the country but also for his own fortunes.

        "text": "Warren Buffett likes to say that you only find out who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out. With earnings season looming, investors also should be careful with companies that appear fully clothed.\n\nThe first quarter was another tough one. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate earnings for S&P 500 companies fell by 7.5% from a year earlier. It is the kind of environment in which the shares of companies that are able to keep notching good results are richly rewarded.\n\nThe trouble is those rewards can also tempt companies to overstep the bounds for fear of swift punishment.\n\nFor a recent project, Patricia Dechow, an accounting professor at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, and three co-authors screened for nonfinancial firms that were subject to enforcement actions for misstating earnings at some point between 1994 and 2010. They then looked at how their earnings compared with analyst estimates during the misstatement period.\n\nTheir finding: 53% of misstating firms topped estimates for at least four consecutive quarters versus 43% for other firms. That is significant.\n\nFor an example of a company that, until recently, was racking up impressive earnings stats, investors need look no further than Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. VRX 1.76 % In the five years that ended in last year\u2019s third quarter, it topped analysts\u2019 median estimates 18 times and met them twice. The streak ended last month when Valeant finally released unaudited fourth-quarter results that fell short of estimates.\n\nNow, doubts are swirling over Valeant\u2019s past results. It has said that it wrongly booked $58 million in revenue in 2014, that it is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that it is unsure when it will file audited 2015 financials. Its stock is nearly 90% below its peak in August.\n\nWhile the book isn\u2019t yet closed on what happened at Valeant, investors should consider if estimate-beating results weren\u2019t actually a warning sign.\n\nAs they ponder that, investors should consider a broader question: What leads a company to game earnings? One theory is greed: Management wants to push the stock higher. Another theory says it is fear: Management is worried about seeing the stock tank.\n\nIt looks like fear plays the greater role. The researchers found that forward price/earnings multiples for companies with strings of earnings beats that fell afoul of the SEC were elevated before the period when they misstated earnings. During the misstatement period, valuations tended to stay rich, but not get any richer.\n\nSo the probable explanation is that companies generally got rewarded with P/E ratios on a run of good results, but weren\u2019t able to keep delivering. For managers who had been enjoying the fruits of a high valuation, this was hard to take.\n\nAn especially big worry: Shares of companies with a history of positive earnings surprises tend to get severely punished after misses. So that raises the stakes for these companies.\n\nAnd those are particularly high today when overall U.S. profits have been flagging after a long period of growth\u2014the tide is going out. Before rewarding a company that seemingly has avoided the earnings slowdown, investors need to be sure it isn\u2019t just wearing the emperor\u2019s new swimming suit.",
        "generated": "Investors should be cautious when companies consistently beat earnings estimates, as it may indicate that they are engaging in earnings manipulation to boost their stock prices.A recent study found that companies that were subject to enforcement actions for misstating earnings had a higher likelihood of beating earnings estimates, but their valuations remained elevated before the period of misstatement.",

        "text": "A state health care watchdog agency on Tuesday warned that medical costs in Massachusetts are likely to rise if Boston Children\u2019s Hospital moves ahead with a controversial $1 billion expansion plan.\n\nThe Health Policy Commission cannot block the project, but its views will be considered by the state Department of Public Health, which has the final say. The commission\u2019s warning comes on top of opposition from competing hospitals and activist groups and may complicate the chances of swift approval for facilities that Children\u2019s says are urgently needed.\n\nThe commission found that adding beds and outpatient facilities at Children\u2019s would be likely to draw patients from other Massachusetts health care providers, increasing spending by an estimated $8.5 million to $18.1 million a year for patients on commercial health insurance. That\u2019s because Children\u2019s has among the highest hospital prices in the state, the commission said.\n\nThe commission routinely studies hospital mergers, but this is the first time it has raised concerns about a hospital\u2019s campus expansion project. Children\u2019s strongly objected to the commission\u2019s comments.\n\nCommission chairman Stuart Altman said a bigger Children\u2019s could eventually threaten to put other pediatric hospitals out of business. Children\u2019s competes with MassGeneral Hospital for Children, Tufts Medical Center\u2019s Floating Hospital for Children, and others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the business of picking winners and losers,\u201d Altman said of the commission. \u201cI believe in markets . . . but we can\u2019t rule out the implication that that would have on cost.\u201d\n\nThe commission voted to send its objections in a seven-page letter to the Department of Public Health. The Children\u2019s project is the biggest capital expense ever to come before public health officials. The department has been reviewing the plans for months, and a decision is expected in October.\n\nChildren\u2019s, which has 404 beds, is the dominant pediatric hospital in Massachusetts and one of the largest in the country, with 46 percent of the statewide market for pediatric patients who have commercial insurance. It wants to construct an 11-story building and add 71 beds to its Longwood Medical Area campus and build an eight-story outpatient center in Brookline.\n\nThe expansion has the potential to boost Children\u2019s share of the pediatric market.\n\nThe new facility at Children\u2019s would eliminate the Prouty Garden (above).\n\nIn disputing the commission\u2019s analysis, hospital officials said they are taking aggressive steps to control costs. They note that a recent consultant\u2019s report \u2014 required by public health officials \u2014 confirmed the expansion project would be consistent with the state\u2019s goals for containing health care costs.\n\n\u201cThe data used by HPC is flawed, misleading, and speculative,\u201d Children\u2019s spokesman Rob Graham said in a statement. \u201cEven if HPC\u2019s worst-case scenario plays out, the cost impact would equal a 0.033% increase in costs to Massachusetts consumers per HPC math.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s says it needs the new beds to accommodate a growing and increasingly complex patient population.\n\nThe recent analysis from Navigant Consulting, which analyzed data provided by Children\u2019s, said the project would not increase health spending in Massachusetts because all the patient growth is expected to come from other states and countries.\n\nBut Altman questioned those projections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable, but very unlikely\u201d that Children\u2019s would be able to fill new beds without taking a greater share of local patients, he said.\n\nThe commission is charged with studying and commenting on the health care market but does not have regulatory powers. Its analyses have had an impact in the past, however. After the panel raised cost concerns about Partners HealthCare\u2019s bid to acquire three community hospitals, a state judge last year rejected an agreement that would have allowed those deals, citing the commission\u2019s studies in her decision.\n\nInitially, commissioners were not unified on what to say about the Children\u2019s project. They had planned to declare a \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the project would lead to increased medical spending, but after much discussion Tuesday morning \u2014 in public and behind closed doors \u2014 they agreed to soften the language to suggest a \u201clikelihood\u201d of increased spending.\n\nThe project already faces strong opposition from people who are upset that the new hospital building would replace the Prouty Garden, a healing garden cherished by many patients, families, and hospital staff. A group of Prouty Garden supporters is suing the hospital. Leaders of MassGeneral and Tufts also have objected to the project.\n\nOpponents of the Children\u2019s project have been lobbying the commission to get involved in the debate, but Altman said that dispute had \u201cvery little\u201d impact on the commission\u2019s decision to comment.\n\nSharon Torgerson, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, which includes the Department of Public Health, said the department had not received or reviewed the commission\u2019s letter as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cTheir comments, along with others, including the Independent Cost Analysis conducted by Navigant, will become part of the official record,\u201d she said in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cEvaluation of reasonableness and costs are one of the nine factors that guide the . . . process, and has been part of our review over the past several months.\u201d",

Last season appeared to be rock bottom, as the Giants\u2019 quarterback tossed a league-high 27 interceptions, including five in a loss to Seattle.\n\nAnd for all of the Giants\u2019 problems heading into Sunday\u2019s loss to the visiting San Francisco 49ers\u2014season-ending injuries to wideout Victor Cruz and cornerback Prince Amukamara, as well as the league\u2019s lowest-rated defense\u2014Manning was the biggest positive, tossing 17 touchdown passes against just six interceptions.\n\nOn Sunday, when his second career five-pick performance resulted in a 16-10 loss, he was practically the Giants\u2019 only problem. \u201cI\u2019ve got to make better decisions, better throws,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThey\u2019re all on me; it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s fault. I\u2019ve got to protect the ball and can\u2019t afford to turn it over, especially a couple times in field-goal range.\u201d\n\nIn his defense, Manning\u2019s offensive line didn\u2019t play well, particularly after right tackle Justin Pugh went down with quadriceps injury in the first half. And statistically, Manning has had worse games; back in 2004, for one, he registered a 0.0 quarterback rating in a 37-14 loss to Baltimore.\n\nBut until Sunday, when he completed 22 of 45 passes for 280 yards and a 36.6 rating, Manning had never been so toxic.\n\nWhen tight end Larry Donnell\u2019s leaping 30-yard reception put the Giants on San Francisco\u2019s 35-yard line, Manning responded with an interception. When Josh Brown\u2019s onside kick surprised the 49ers and resulted in a Giants\u2019 first down near midfield, Manning responded with an interception. And when Odell Beckham Jr. defied gravity by hauling in a flying 37-yard sideline catch in the fourth quarter, Manning responded with his fifth and costliest pick of the day.\n\nThe potentially game-winning pass to Preston Parker was deflected before falling into the hands of 49ers linebacker Chris Borland. But that fact should not absolve Manning, who tossed three consecutive incompletions from the 4-yard line prior to the turnover.\n\nManning\u2019s first pick, in the second quarter, was a poor read. He was trying squeeze a pass into Beckham before 49ers linebacker Chris Borland jumped the route. On the next drive, Manning saw a looming defender behind receiver Rueben Randle, but let go of the football anyway. \u201cI tried to pull it back and couldn\u2019t pull it back enough and it kind of slipped out and went to the linebacker,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the interceptions. Manning neglected open receivers on several plays, and overthrew others in big spots. He even put running back Rashad Jennings at risk with a check-down pass at the end of the third quarter. Fortunately for the defenseless Jennings, who was playing for the first time since spraining his knee in Week 5, the pass fell incomplete.\n\nThe 49ers deserve some credit for the way they pressured Manning, but his meek response shouldn\u2019t have been a total surprise. Entering Sunday, Manning had completed just 35.6% of his passes when under pressure, ranking him below every qualifying quarterback besides former Jets starter Geno Smith, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously the accuracy issue,\u201d Tom Coughlin said afterward. \u201cHe had great pressure and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to argue with that one.\u201d",

Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email that the company was committed to providing the capability and affordability to meet national security needs.\n\nWhile the F-35 program has been dogged by problems and costs have escalated to an estimated $379 billion, it is significantly newer than the F-18, which does not have the same stealth capabilities.\n\n\"They're two completely different aircraft from different generations,\" said Phillip Carter, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. \"It's like comparing an old jeep to a Humvee.\"\n\nDan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit that investigates government contractors, said the F-35's stealth capabilities drove the cost up, but its usefulness had not yet been demonstrated. He said canceling the program, however, would be \"disruptive.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump touted his negotiating skills as a businessman, and he appears to be using similar tactics as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20. It was not clear how his blunt style would translate to Pentagon procurement or international diplomacy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters there that he had guaranteed costs would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the presidential plane, another project Trump calls too expensive.\n\nLockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson did not speak to reporters but said in a statement that the meeting was \"productive.\" Trump told reporters he wanted to cut the F-35 program's costs.\n\nFor more on Donald Trump's tweets, watch this video:\n\nIf he scrapped the F-35, such a move by a new administration would have some precedent. Then-President Jimmy Carter canceled the B-1 bomber program in June 1977, although it was resurrected by his White House successor, Ronald Reagan.\n\nTrump's jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a hurdle for all U.S. defense contractors in the next administration, Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at financial services firm Cowen & Co, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\n\"We have no idea how this plays out but believe 'Twitter risk' for defense companies could be a significant issue over the next four years,\" Schweizer wrote. \"This is Lockheed Martin's time in the barrel.\"",

But \u201cwhite tuna\u201d was written next to the word \u201cescolar\u201d \u2014 as if the two were interchangeable. They are not.

The owner said he has since revised the menu to simply say cod.\n\nIn 2011, the H Mart supermarket in Burlington misrepresented crimson snapper for the more expensive red snapper, and escolar, which can cause gastrointestinal problems, was mislabeled as white tuna. At the time, an executive with H Mart blamed a supplier for the mix-up.

Photograph: Rex Features\n\nThe extraordinary works Henri Matisse made during the last period of his life \u2013 the large-scale cut-outs on coloured paper, including his famous Blue Nudes \u2013 are to be exhibited at Tate Modern next spring.\n\nIt will be the most comprehensive exhibition of these late works ever held, with 120 on show, including his Large Composition with Masks from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Memory of Oceania from the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Tate's own The Snail. These works were displayed together by the artist in his studio, and will be seen together again for the first time during the exhibition.\n\nThe artist began to make cut-outs in 1943, according to the curator Nicholas Cullinan, after an operation in his early 70s that left him in ill health and the feeling that he was living on borrowed time. At first the impulse was pure expedience: the works could be made much more quickly than an oil painting. At the same time, \"he began to realise the potential in the method, and stopped painting, choosing to focus on the cut-outs,\" said Cullinan. \"He talked about how liberated he felt; how he had been given a second life.\"\n\nWith assistants colouring the paper to precise specifications and then helping to position the works, Matisse would \"make cut-outs with a rapid gesture with the scissors, incredibly quickly,\" said Cullinan. He was also \"fastidious and meticulous\", redoing and altering the work until it was exactly right.\n\nHe became so entrenched in this way of making art that \"his work rate accelerated rather than diminished \u2013 he would work around the clock and assistants in their 20s remembered being really put through their paces by him. He was still working in 1954, two days before he died.\"\n\nThey were extraordinarily forward-looking works. \"They are more like installations or environments than paintings; and they seem very contemporary now. Part of the point of the show is to reconsider them in this light,\" said Cullinan. \"They were a way of collapsing line and colour; at the same time they were a kind of sculpture \u2013 carving into pure colour.\"\n\nTate Modern's 2014 exhibition lineup will also include shows devoted to two recently departed major figures, Richard Hamilton, the father of British pop art, and the German master Sigmar Polke. There will also be an exhibition devoted to a hugely important figure from the early 20th century, the Russian constructivist Kasimir Malevich.\n\nAt Tate Britain, there will be the first big survey of British folk art, an exhibition devoted to Turner's late period, and an exhibition examining the cultural contribution of the critic and scholar Kenneth Clark. The sculptor Phyllida Barlow, known for her works in inexpensive and low grade materials, has been asked to make new work for the Tate Britain Commission, which invites an artist to develop a new work in response to the Tate collection.\n\nAt Tate Liverpool a show devoted to Mondrian, marking 70 years since his death, will include a reconstruction of his Paris studio.",

He is also known for the extraordinary prices his works realise at auction: his Architect's Home in the Ravine was sold for \u00a37.7m at Christie's auction house this year.\n\nThe exhibition, called No Foreign Lands, will show 120 works made over the past dozen years, including a handful of freshly completed paintings that have never been shown in public before. He continues to draw on his life in Trinidad, where he has lived with his family since 2002, and which, he said, \"continually poses possibilities for painting, in a different way from London or New York. In Trinidad you might see something just on the walk to the studio. It's hard to explain; it's just that kind of place.\"\n\nWhen Doig came to prominence in the 1990s, his figurative painting was somewhat out of kilter with the neo-conceptualism of the Young British Artists (YBA). He became known for pictures suggested by the landscapes of Canada, but with surface patinas and patterning that hinted that he was at least as interested in the formal language of painting as in representing the world he saw.\n\nAccording to Keith Hartley, the curator of the exhibition, \"he is trying to get some kind of balance between something he's seen in reality and can't get out of his mind, and being pulled in a formal direction\".\n\nDoig's work has always defied easy categorisation. \"You can't place him in any fashion or school,\" Hartley said. \"He's not a YBA, he's a free spirit.\"\n\nUnlike the ideas-based works of many of his peers, Doig's paintings are, rather, situated in the world of purely visual thinking. Doig himself said he enjoyed his slightly off-centre world, in dialogue as much with the painters of the past, such as Matisse, Bonnard or Degas, as with his own painter peers.\n\n\"I never minded being a bit on the outside; I liked that painting was marginalised, a bit of a niche activity. I'm not saying it's clandestine, but other people who make paintings: that's who your real audience is,\" he said.\n\nHis work has the \"kind of authority that can't be striven for, but only arrived at like an unexpected gift\", according to the Guardian art critic Adrian Searle.\n\nNo Foreign Lands: Peter Doig is at the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, from 3 August to 3 November.",

The problem is that so many of these big ideas for a \"big society\" come from a government whose painful economic policies make the enthusiastic ideological overproduction look like the most cynical window-dressing \u2013 liberal-minded tinsel on a Tory tree whose needles turn out to be razors. Is nobody doing any ambitious social thinking that is not a veil for callous cuts?\n\nStep forward, the Serpentine gallery. This will come as no surprise to fans of its co-director Hans Ulrich Obrist, whose publications, projects and patronage of artists amount to a sustained attempt to reconnect art, ideas, and the world and have made the Serpentine the most creative public art space in London. The latest manifestation of the slightly wacky sense of mission that flourishes at the Serpentine is a community art project with a difference. Skills Exchange brings together artists and community groups and makes a point of linking young artists and older people: out of a residency by artist Tom Hunter on the Woodberry Down estate in Hackney, east London, comes a film he made with older residents called A Palace for Us.\n\nThis is a magical film. It weaves the memories of people who grew up in east London and have lived on the estate since it opened into a silvery thread of meaning illuminated by dramatisations of their experiences filmed in the aged, but dignified, Woodberry Down buildings and public spaces. The estate, begun in 1946 and completed in 1963, was like a \"palace\" to those who remembered the East End slums, remembers one participant. But the film is also a palace of memory. Contemporary art often seems obsessed with youth: here it listens to the stories the old have to tell.\n\nIt evokes all our stories. Britain in 1945, out of the ruins of war, built the welfare state that clever rich kids are now so casually pulling apart. Estates like Woodberry Down embody an ideal of decent housing for all that was born out of the miseries of the 1930s and terror of the 1940s. A Palace for Us gently and acutely bears witness to this history that is now being dismantled.\n\nHunter's film is not a rant, but a moving homage to lives and memories that today are obliterated by harsh and violent caricatures of the white working class. Everyone should go to the Serpentine to learn to see through his subjects' eyes. The government should go.",

The usually slender Gibson had lost even more weight, causing fans to taunt her skeletal appearance online. \"Some were just plain mean and ignorant,\" she says.\n\nThe response inspired Gibson to come clean about a health challenge she has been facing.\n\n\"Last year, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease,\" she writes on her\n\n\"It is an elusive disease that disguises itself as many other things, and creates a lot of pain and discomfort.\"\n\n\"The first symptoms came in the form of food sensitivities,\" she continues. \"I found I could not touch sugar, starch, caffeine, certain oils, etc. without having a severe reaction that felt like electricity running through my body.\"\n\nNext came the nerve pain and muscle fatigue. She wondered if she had mono. According to Gibson, her doctors tested her for \"everything under the sun\" \u2013 except for Lyme disease.\n\nShe continued to worsen. \"I kept eating a ton of protein and fat to try to keep weight on \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 egg yolks, red meat, you name it. But the weight kept falling off and I had a gaunt and sinewy look.\"\n\nShe felt numbness and tingling in her hands and feet, which she says was \"very disconcerting for a pianist and dancer, to say the least.\" The tingling was followed by night sweats, fever, nerve tremors, nightmares and migraines.\n\nHer loved ones were concerned about her weight loss. \"At times, my boyfriend would insist I eat some pasta and butter, even though I did not feel great doing it,\" she says. \" 'You need to gain weight,' he would say. My spine was frail and unprotected.\"\n\nAlarmed by her gaunt appearance, Gibson says she sought Botox to smooth out the deep lines in her forehead. \"Both the trauma of the needles and the toxin itself wreaked havoc on my physical and mental state. I will never put this or any other toxin into my body for vanity reasons again.\"\n\n\"Five days after the treatment, I was texting my boyfriend and he noticed I was mixing up my words. I had trouble with directions and driving. I was terrified.\"\n\nGibson says she finally found a \"Lyme-literate doctor\" who started treating her for the disease. \"I remember sitting in his office, despondent,\" she says. \" 'I am in here somewhere,' I said through tears.

As her body has responded to the treatment, Gibson says she's getting back to normal.\n\n\"I actually feel like me again,\" she says. \"We all face challenges and I am learning much from the ones I am facing.

        "text": "It was one of the bloodiest days in World War II history that most people have never heard of.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the D-Day invasion, Allied forces conducted a training exercise off the southern coast of England to simulate the landing of large forces on enemy soil. German torpedo boats got wind of the exercise and sank two troop vessels, killing more than 700 soldiers and sailors.\n\nNow an underwater robot from the Massachusetts company whose autonomous submarines have surveyed the wreck of the Titanic and searched for Amelia Earhart\u2019s plane has captured vivid images of the remains of the lost vessels.\n\nIn March, a Remus 100 submarine made by Hydroid Inc. of Pocasset used sonar to find and capture images of the landing craft lost during Exercise Tiger, a simulation of the Allied invasion of Normandy that would take place about a month later. Hydroid carried out the survey at its own expense, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the sinking.\n\nUnderwater robots are in wide use around the world for deep-water surveying, naval surveillance, and oceanographic research. A similar robot made by Bluefin Robotics Inc. of Quincy is being used to search the southern Indian Ocean for traces of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That sub, Bluefin-21, can dive to 15,000 feet, far deeper than the Remus 100 used in the search for the World War II wrecks.\n\nBut a larger model from Hydroid, the Remus 6000, can dive to 20,000 feet. In 2011, three of those were used to find the remains of Air France 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.\n\nThe US National Archives/Exercise Tiger Trust\n\nAllied forces practiced landings on the south coast of England.\n\nThe quest to photograph the two WWII troop carriers was sparked by Graham Lester, a British citizen and a Hydroid vice president. During a vacation last summer, he encountered a seaside memorial in Torcross, England, to those who died in Exercise Tiger.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s scratching his head and going, how come nobody knows about this?\u201d said Hydroid\u2019s Kathy Forrester.\n\nIndeed, Exercise Tiger remained a secret for weeks after the sinking, because the Allied command did not want to give away vital intelligence about its invasion plans.\n\nThe two sunken ships were among a group of eight carrying about 4,000 American support troops, who were to follow up the first wave of the invasion. On April 28, 1944, they had sailed about 30 miles off the southern coast of England, and were to make their practice landing in an area called Slapton Sands, because it resembles one of the Normandy invasion areas called Utah Beach.\n\nBut the German navy picked up radio traffic from the American ships, and ordered in nine torpedo boats. During the ensuing battle, three of the eight landing craft were hit by torpedoes. While one made it back to England, two sank.\n\nIncredibly, the carnage continued as the remaining landing craft reached the beach. British artillery had been ordered to shell the landing zone, to make the training more realistic. But they were supposed to cease fire once the American landing began. They didn\u2019t, and over 200 more Americans died from friendly fire.\n\nIn all, Exercise Tiger took the lives of nearly 1,000 men; the actual landing at Utah Beach resulted in fewer than 200 dead.\n\nAfter visiting the Exercise Tiger memorial, Lester came up with the idea to create images of the lost landing craft. He got the backing of his superiors at Hydroid, which is owned by Kongsberg Maritime of Norway, and the company donated its time and equipment for the search.\n\nBritain\u2019s Royal Navy also offered to help, and conducted a separate survey of the area.\n\nTracking down the lost ships was relatively easy, as the general area of the sinkings was well known. The wrecks lie in about 150 feet of water, within the Remus 100\u2019s relatively shallow diving range of about 300 feet.\n\nThe robot carries high-resolution sonars on either side of its hull, and can sweep the ocean bottom in a back-and-forth, lawn-mower-like pattern to find sunken objects.\n\nMike Mulrooney, a Hydroid senior field service technician, said that once the general location of the ships was pinned down, the Remus 100 could pass fairly close to the wrecks. Hydroid also increased the speed at which its sonar \u201cpinged\u201d the target with sound waves, resulting in sharp, detailed images of the ships.\n\n\u201cThe faster we can ping, the more data points are made across the body of the wreck,\u201d said Mulrooney.\n\nThe images produced by the Hydroid team will be donated to the UK National Archives and to local organizations that maintain memorials to Exercise Tiger. A Hydroid spokeswoman said there are no plans for further exploration of the site.\n\nUnder US and international law, the wreckage of warships sunk in battle remain the property of the nations for which they fought, and are to be treated as grave sites. Such wrecks may not be salvaged without the permission of the nation that owns them.",

        "text": "Twenty-five years ago Wednesday, Chinese troops violently retook the square in Beijing where pro-democracy protesters had set up camp for weeks. The Tiananmen Square massacre left an unknown number dead, with some estimates in the thousands, and smothered a democratic movement. But after a quarter-century\u2014and a thorough attempt by the Chinese government to conceal the events that unfolded that June\u2014our collective memory is sometimes limited to not much more than an image of a man defiantly standing in front of a tank.\n\nSo TIME went back in history to pull out the details, context and feelings of those grim days from our own unfolding coverage at the time, including a cover story from the June 12, 1989 issue. The articles give color, detail and context that are sometimes lost 25 years later. Here are five key facts that may have been buried in time:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only protest\n\nThe demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, which at one point had reportedly ballooned to a million people, were not the only pro-democracy protests in the country at the time. Demonstrations had spread to hundreds of cities, including Shanghai, China\u2019s largest, and in the days after the military mobilized in Beijing, protesters were putting up blockades in Shanghai.\n\nAnd to be sure, it wasn\u2019t the first time protesters had filled the Square in Beijing, a space for public protest. More than a decade earlier, in what became known as the Tiananmen Incident, a similar if smaller-scale crackdown on protesters spawned outrage and led to a reshuffling of the nation\u2019s top leadership.\n\nIn a report on the \u201cTank Man\u201d several years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, TIME described the Square as:\n\nTiananmen Square\u2013the very heart of the Middle Kingdom, where students had demonstrated in 1919 [as part of the \u201cMay Fourth Movement\u201d]; where Mao had proclaimed a \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic\u201d in 1949 on behalf of the Chinese people who had \u201cstood up\u201d; and where leaders customarily inspect their People\u2019s Liberation Army troops\u2014is a virtual monument to People Power in the abstract.\n\nChinese authorities still censor information about the massacre\n\nMore than a quarter century after the massacre, the Chinese government\u2019s extensive censorship apparatus\u2014which employs two million online censors \u2014 still rigorously blocks information about the protest. The ban is so total that not only is the search term \u201cTiananmen Square\u201d censored, but so too are related words and phrases. Authorities have even gone as far as blocking combinations of the numbers 6, 4, 1989 that might obliquely reference the date of the protest, June 4, 1989. So for many members of the world\u2019s largest online population, the facts about the bloody crackdown have been erased.\n\nGorbachev entered through the back door\n\nThe protests presented an embarrassing pickle for the Chinese government during a visit from the Soviet Union\u2019s Mikhail Gorbachev, the first visit from a leader of China\u2019s communist peer in 30 years. The Chinese had scheduled a state banquet in the Great Hall of the People at the edge of the Square in May, as the protests raged. Gorbachev ended up having to go through the back door.\n\nWhen the military opened fire, a lopsided battle ensued\n\nIn the early hours of June 4, 50 trucks and as many as 10,000 troops rumbled into the streets, TIME reported just days later. The military overwhelmed the civilians and began firing into crowds, but some protesters held fast, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails.

The move, which goes into effect on June 20, will be a big blow to Amex as it loses business from the millions of customers who patronize the second largest U.S. retailer.\n\nThe new credit card, which will be issued by Citi c for Costco, will be called \u201cCostco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi\u201d and double as a membership card for Costco shoppers. (American Express Costco cards will automatically be canceled and won\u2019t work at any stores after June 19. Citi will automatically send the card out to Amex Costco cardholders in May.)\n\nIt is clear that it is a much more generous program than the Amex card it will soon replace, something Nomura Securities analyst Robert Drbul said would bring in more customers and help Costco stand out from other retailers.\n\nThe Citi card will offer Costco members 4% cash back on up to $7,000 spent on gas, compared to 3% back up to $4,000 with Amex. Cardholders will also get 3% back on restaurants and travel, a point higher than with the Amex cards. There is no annual fee but shoppers will need to pay for a $55 annual Costco membership.\n\n\u201cWe believe the improved rewards program has strong potential to drive this card to top-of-wallet for many consumers, which should also benefit Costco,\u201d Drbul said in his note.\n\nAs Costco looks to fend off Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s wmt efforts to win new business, the new Visa card may offer the discount retailer a helping hand. As Sean McQuay, credit card expert for Nerdwallet, told the Chicago Tribune this week, the Visa card could entice people who aren\u2019t currently Costco shoppers.\n\nAccording to McQuay, the Costco Visa offers the best cash back rates on gas, restaurants, and travel. And Costco customers tend to be affluent, a highly desirable clientele for credit card companies. The median household income of a Costco member is about $120,000, according to some estimates.",

        "text": "The Entrepreneur Insiders network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America\u2019s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cHow do you build a strong team?\u201d is written by Brian Smith, chief wine officer at Winc.\n\nThe quality I always look for in individuals is the same quality that I would hope to get out of a high-performance team: intuition. Those who have intuition are more equipped to see opportunities, find an optimal solution, and innovate, all while understanding their partner\u2019s positions or motives. It is an awareness that makes people more creative, effective, and generally more fun to work with.\n\nIn order to pinpoint intuition, I look for people who may have started something on their own, even if it has failed. It\u2019s more about taking initiative, seeing the landscape, and trying to find a niche solution or opportunity. I always like to ask, \u201cWhen was the last time that you created something you were proud of?\u201d It\u2019s a classic interview question for me, regardless of the role.\n\nOnce you have some incredible people on your team, the next steps are to get aligned and stay connected. Alignment and connectivity are the pillars for success on any team. Not only do people need to embrace and understand the big goals, but they need to embrace consistent communication and maintain focus to increase the probability of hitting those goals.\n\nSee also: Why Hiring Just for Experience Is a Really Bad Idea\n\nFor most of us, it\u2019s nearly impossible to step away from the day-to-day action, but I have become a huge believer in getting offsite. It\u2019s amazing what a change of scenery and a bare-bones agenda can get you. These are often the greatest opportunities for strategic alignment, deeper understanding, and innovation as a team. At a recent offsite, we encouraged the team to challenge the status quo. One of our team members came up with the idea to change the way we packaged our wine, and we ended up saving a few hundred thousand dollars in addition to significantly reducing our environmental impact. You can\u2019t get to these types of ideas if you don\u2019t provide your team with a free and open environment to put everything on the table.\n\nOnce you have the big goals and initiatives, it all comes down to execution. This is hard, especially in the winemaking business. For about a third of the year, I\u2019m in remote vineyards all over the world, and the days are long. Travel like this completely takes me away from day-to-day communication with my team. But spending time in the market or in the vineyards with purveyors, customers, growers, and winemakers is invaluable to informing my point of view.\n\nTo stay connected while I\u2019m traveling, I try to schedule a 30-minute touch-base meeting with each leader every week. We leverage 15Five, which is a great tool for recapping the week\u2019s wins, losses, near-term goals, and challenges.\n\nHire intuitive people, build a strategy together, and have a clear system for achieving success. To me, this is the foundation for a successful team. If you can throw in a little passion and fun, the sky is the limit.",

The unveiling has been widely anticipated following last year\u2019s acquisition of calling and screen-sharing app Screenhero by Slack.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\n\nThe feature, according to TechCrunch, is for the time being a beta available to less than 50% of Slack users, and allows audio conferencing and emoji during calls. It works through Slack\u2019s desktop app, not, apparently, through the web interface. Video calling is expected to be added soon, along with wider availability. Slack had previously offered integration with third-party conferencing and calling tools including Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Skype and Google GOOG Hangouts, but the new integrated calling feature is reportedly much slicker.\n\nSlack\u2019s call integration has huge implications for its competitors in team communications\u2014most obviously, Skype.

        "text": "Few observers were surprised when tech giant Hewlett-Packard (\n\n) for hiring Mark Hurd -- HP's former CEO -- as co-president. After all, Hurd is no doubt in possession of HP's crown-jewel corporate secrets. Moreover, HP, which competes directly with Oracle in a number of critical enterprise software and hardware markets, probably had no choice, if for no other reason than to save face.\n\nBut Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is a man who inevitably gets exactly what he wants -- and in this case, what he wants may be HP itself, in order to better to compete with IBM (\n\n). But buying HP, a $90 billion Goliath? That's crazy, right?\n\n\"Larry Ellison is borderline bat-shit crazy on a good day,\" says veteran Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. \"I think his bet is that he can damage HP enough that it drops in value and he can wander in with an offer.\"\n\n\"Ellison believes he can do anything, and he wants to go after IBM,\" Enderle adds. \"If he can figure out a way to get HP, then I believe he would like to do that. Because he would really like to bring IBM out, and he needs [a company] of the stature of HP to do it.\"\n\nOracle's market capitalization is about $120 billion so, at least in theory, some kind of stock-based transaction is possible.\n\nAnd what better person to integrate HP into Oracle than its highly successful -- Hurd was loved on Wall Street, though loathed inside HP -- former CEO? At least Ellison has traded up from Charles Phillips, a once-powerful but now crippled co-president at Oracle who had spent much of his recent year in a very public and very ugly spat over adultery allegations that included a honest-to-goodness billboard campaign against the former investment banker.\n\nIndeed, Hurd has shown he can do top-notch cost-cutting of the sort that Larry likes and needs in order to integrate his myriad acquisitions. Further, Hurd and Ellison share a \"buy-it, don't-build\" mindset that should make for an easy working relationship.\n\n\"Oracle wants to rebuild Sun, and Hurd is a turnaround packager who never really sold the package at HP,\" says Enderle. \"He's left a mess, stripped to the bone, but with good financials.\"\n\nEllison is a man with ambitions as big as his MIG-29 fighter jet is fast, and he's got a history of stating that the info-tech industry will further consolidate in the same way the auto industry consolidated into the Big Three in the U.S.\n\nWith his purchase of Sun Microsystems, Ellison showed an appetite for enterprise hardware that he could use to vertically integrate sales of what is now a near-complete enterprise software stack, which includes databases, application server/middleware, customer-relationship management tools, financial applications, product-lifecycle management and enterprise resource planning tools.\n\nHP's strong position in the hardware and server market would instantly give Oracle a reason to touch millions of customers at myriad places in their business, from storage, to networking, to servers. That's a position IBM has also valued, considering its continued investments in its hardware lines like server and storage (even as it cast off its less profitable PC lines to Lenovo).\n\nTrue, lots of orphans would be left over in an Oracle-HP deal. HP's core printer and imaging unit doesn't clearly fit into Oracle's fold, nor does its big consumer and PC products or its foray into smartphones via the recent acquisition of Palm.\n\nEnderle theorizes that Ellison would spin out HP's printing and imaging business. \"But this all hinges on whether Hurd can execute,\" Enderle says. \"If I'm right, Larry wants to walk away with a [combined] company that would go head-to-head with IBM virtually anywhere. The deal would be very difficult and somewhat convoluted, but we're talking about a guy [Ellison] who lives and breathes war.\"\n\nWhen your end goal is global dominance, difficulty is a mere distraction. And this would likely be a three-year to five-year plan. HP's lawsuit will likely tie up Hurd and Oracle for quite some time, but Ellison is a powerful force, and his wishes rarely go unrealized.\n\nHP claims Hurd can't perform his new job of co-president without disclosing HP secrets in violation of his confidentiality agreement. But Enderle points out that in California, noncompete and other employment contract clauses are \"generally unenforceable.\"\n\n\"HP can go after Hurd's [$40 million] severance package,\" says Enderle, \"but they can't keep him out of Oracle.\" And what could be sweeter revenge for Hurd than winding up running HP again -- as a part of Oracle?",

Highly liquid guests are assigned casino hosts who make certain things disappear (lines, doormen) and other things appear (tables, perhaps some company). But if you\u2019re not among the super-rich and already enjoying such privileges, it pays to be crafty.\n\nJust ask Jack Colton, a local Vegas hero who reveals the secrets of Sin City nightlife on his Web site to everyday players who aspire to VIP-table status. One of his tips: If you\u2019re waiting in line in a large group of men, try scattering yourself among several groups of ladies. Divide and conquer.\n\nIn Depth: Vegas\u2019 Top Nightclubs\n\nAnd once you\u2019re inside, it\u2019s a good idea to just go with the flow. That is, assuming you can accept that this is all about excessive consumption and pushing the limits of a credit card, not to mention what\u2019s socially acceptable behavior just about anywhere else in the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about building a buzz for the nightclubs as well as a client\u00e8le, not just celebrities but also brands. In Vegas a club is only as good as their last event,\u201d says Andrea Sun, one of the nightlife experts at Vegas.com.\n\nEuropean-style tableside bottle service is becoming more and more de rigeur\u2013in return for a nice table, guests are obliged to purchase bottles of alcohol at astronomical mark-ups. And nightclubs and their marketing departments are heavily invested in customized experiences, especially when it concerns celebrities.\n\nDeborah Krause, COO of PURE Management Group, which runs the club by the same name in Caesar\u2019s Palace, says, \u201cPMG has established a reputation for excellence by providing service with flair. We strive to offer celebrities and VIPs with a nightlife experience that is seamless and unparalleled, and that personalized VIP service also translates to all of our patrons, making every guest who visits a PMG venue feel like a VIP.\u201d\n\nSo which club should you choose? If you\u2019re looking for a high-energy mega-club, we suggest Studio 54 or Rain. If you\u2019re looking to impress some clients with a Vegas experience they\u2019re likely to go home and brag about, don\u2019t miss TAO, Moon or PURE. And for more of a mellow, airy evening, we suggest Tryst at Wynn Las Vegas, with its 90-foot waterfall.\n\nAs with other leisure pursuits, timing is crucial. On Fridays and Saturdays Vegas nightclubs are filled with tourists, while on select weeknights the clubs host industry nights for the locals. Moon hosts a Tuesday industry night that\u0092s popular with other club employees.\n\n\u201cClubs thrive on weekends and industry nights,\u201d says Sun. \u201cBoth options are strong and well-known.\u201d\n\nWherever and whenever you go, though, Colton warns that while dozens of \u201cVIP hosting companies\u201d promise access to exclusive clubs, you\u2019re usually better off tipping the doorman directly. And by tipping, we don\u2019t mean five bucks. A few other words of advice:\n\n\u2013Ask about the bottle minimum before you show up. \u2013If you\u2019re splitting the bill between friends, collect the money up-front (to make sure you\u2019re still friends at the end of the night). \u2013Don\u2019t get hustled\u2013make sure you\u2019re not obligated to buy more bottles to avoid losing your table. \u2013Have fun.\n\nIn Depth: Vegas\u2019 Top Nightclubs\n\nLike this story?

        "text": "Surround sound \u2026 Haroon Mirza's Adam, Eve and a UFO (2013). Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Lisson Gallery\n\nOften, I dance alone in my flat. How sad is that, you say, but I don't care. Feeling the beats pulsing through me, being taken over by dark rhythms or a voice, I sometimes fall over the furniture. Which is why I didn't risk dancing in Haroon Mirza's exhibition at the Lisson Gallery \u2013 though the whumffs and thuds beating around a circle of eight speakers in the upstairs gallery, all pointing inward, proved almost irresistible.\n\nA column of sound rose in the centre of the space. I wanted to be there, surrounded, but there was too much stuff in the way: the foam sound-baffles on the walls, the speakers on the floor, the \"UFO circuit\" (I have no idea what a UFO is in electronic terms, but it looks pretty with its pulsing lights) and all the cables festooned about the place crowded me out. Following the aural conversation criss-crossing the room from speaker to speaker (each one different) made me feel I was in some swanky hi-fi studio, being given a demo of the system that's right for me.\n\nLet's try the reverberation chamber instead, a shiny, all-white room. Clap your hands and the echo is a hard and immediate ricochet. A panel speaker hangs from the ceiling and a tubular LED light leans casually against a wall. The light comes on and off, but it is nothing like Martin Creed's famous work. I was alone in there, except for an ant. I only saw it for a moment before the light went out. It looked stunned. Perhaps it was dead.\n\nWhen the light comes on, it is accompanied by a shushing sound that gets louder as the light dies away to darkness. We are left in an abrupt silence that reminded me of Beckett's Breath. When the light came on again the ant was still there, an inert speck on a glass ledge inside something like an old-fashioned paraffin lamp, or perhaps a crack pipe, on the floor. It is an ant farm. When an ant wanders over a copper plate inside, the pitter-pattering of its miniscule feet is mixed in with the sound of water: something like rain, or the noise inside a shower. That's what we hear when the light comes on.\n\nI stayed in there for a long time, bemused. Then later, on the street, looking in through the window, I saw the exterior shell of Mirza's chamber in a sealed off part of the gallery. A showerhead has been plumbed into the wall, gushing water into a plastic dustbin. A microphone relays the noise of the shower into the chamber, along with the ants' footfalls. That's the sound you hear when the light comes on.\n\nOriginally, this peculiar work had the title Pavilion for a Beautiful Nuisance. This has now been changed to Pavilion for Optimisation. Ant noises; water; reverb. Is this a kind of found and manipulated music? It is the sound of something approaching as the light fades away. The reverb in the room makes me feel exposed.\n\nIn another part of the gallery stands an array of turntables, the needles juddering over various doctored vinyl and handmade records, all played by an invisible DJ. One turntable has been adapted to set off electronic wails, like a bird calling from high up in a jungle canopy. You'd go mad if you had to listen all day, and the whole thing has a doomy, repetitive beat. Amid it all is a recorded voice, from far away and long ago.\n\nIn 1969, the American minimalist composer Alvin Lucier sat alone in a room, and recorded a brief statement: \"I am sitting in a room, different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed \u2026\" Lucier played back his voice, rerecorded it and played it back again. He repeated the process until his voice became a quivering abstract resonance equivalent in sound to the room itself. Lucier had a slight speech impediment; I Am Sitting in a Room was an attempt to smooth out his own speech defects. You can hear him hesitating over the word rhythm. It sounds like he is speaking from inside an echo chamber, or his words are being manipulated by a DJ. There's a clue here to the whole of Mirza's show.\n\nMirza has remixed Lucier's recording, compounding the composer's degenerated voice with the other sounds in the gallery: the beats of a needle bouncing over tape glued to a record, a long foghorn boom from another prepared disc. This is Lucier, the dubstep remix. I tried dancing, but the tempo made me feel like a slow-mo zombie on downers.\n\nOn a website dedicated to this show are a number of fascinating essays about Mirza's work.

        "text": "An almost believable view \u2026 Jules de Balincourt's High and Low, Photograph: Jules de Balincourt/Victoria Miro Gallery\n\nThe day has a holiday air. People are out on their rooftops or standing about on patches of green. I can't tell what time of day it is \u2013 let's say the afternoon \u2013 or the season; the soft sunlight and hazy distance, where unending buildings rise in the thickening sky, make me think of late summer or early autumn. That was the time of year the painting was finished, so maybe something of the world crept into the Brooklyn studio where Jules de Balincourt painted High and Low, completing the large group of paintings now at Victoria Miro Gallery.\n\nHigh and Low is filled with the kind of modern, aspirational shoebox architecture you find everywhere; a ubiquitous banality hemming diminutive bits of 19th-century Greek revival \u2013 a stray townhouse and a distant set of steps that seem to lead nowhere. Here and there the cityscape gets fudged. It is a world unfinished, or about to give up on itself. At points the perspective goes astray, the buildings warping out of alignment. Some of the figures don't seem quite solid, either, or have forgotten to bring their shadows with them. At one point, the sky abandons its pretence, and you can see the whirls and knots of the plywood panel on which it was painted. It is like The Truman Show.\n\nThis is something we often care not to remember when we look at a painting. We know the birds are just ticks of paint and the world is just smears and blobs on a sheet of board, or a bit of cloth stretched over a frame and fastened there with cheap industrial staples or a row of carpet tacks. You'd be an idiot not to acknowledge the something and nothing that is a painting, but even more of a fool to reduce it to bare material fact. The world is always about to fall apart, and us with it, so it's best to acknowledge the happenstance miracle of being alive.\n\nPerhaps that is what is happening here, in this almost believable view, where people have gathered, going about their day or ranged on the rooftops in watery light, looking at something we can't fathom. Maybe everyone is waiting for something to happen. They seem to be looking towards the small park, but there isn't much going on down there. There's a very big statue of a man with a cane, dwarfing the strollers, and what seems to be a picnic. Kids play, couples walk. We are either too early or too late, which leaves us free to let our eyes wander.\n\nHigh and Low would make a good jigsaw or drawing for a New Yorker cover. It's the sort of painting you can project yourself into, losing yourself in this painted day. This is an unsophisticated sort of pleasure, but one I never wholly tire of. Children like to lose themselves in pictures like this. You imagine the lives people live there, and get distracted as you look. You could call it escapism but you always re-find yourself inside the labyrinth of looking, thinking and daydreaming. Looking is a beginning as much as an end in itself.\n\nAll these windows in all these buildings remind me of a nativity calendar. Each one is itself like a little painting. Some show us the corner of a room, the ones further away as abstract as a Kazimir Malevich work. Oddly, the little dun-coloured interior views in the nearer buildings remind me of some early paintings by Luc Tuymans. Nothing much happens in them, either.\n\nThese fragmentary internal views incite our curiosity and voyeurism. I stay on the lookout for someone dressing or having a row or pressed up against the window having a bit of wild sex, as they do in Steve McQueen's film Shame. But they don't, or I haven't found them yet. They'd just be blobs anyway. I feel like Jimmy Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, or Gene Hackman in Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 thriller The Conversation. Looking becomes bugging, a kind of god-like act of surveillance. The more you look, the more there is to see, but the anomalies of this world become even more insistent, as if the fiction can't sustain itself. The unreliable narrator becomes the unreliable painter.\n\nJules de Balincourt's paintings are not very consistent. There are big ones and little ones, crowded ones and empty ones, paintings filled with figures and others that appear almost entirely abstract. Sometimes he paints explosions, but they're sort of benign and cartoonish, opening like jazzy flowers. He paints views and people and maps and words, pretty much always on birch panels using thin oils. There's one piece showing a man sticking something in a bin; and there's a cursory portrait of Chelsea Manning, hung high on the wall, as though removed from the rest of the world.\n\nBut most paintings have groups of people in them, some seen close up, others far away: people sitting in a tree, people watching, sleeping or sitting around in the shade. Every painting has its own atmosphere, its own timbre. There are all degrees of depiction, just as there are different flaws, fault lines and blind spots. Things that have been painted out grin through the layers, like the smile of the Cheshire cat.\n\nOften de Balincourt starts in one place and ends in another, working on a large number of paintings at once. He doesn't draw and he rarely uses photographs or other source material. Ideas migrate from painting to painting, as if he were telling himself a story. He likes to let things fall apart, and to let the half-said or the inarticulate have their stumbling say. Viewing his work is like stumbling on the kerb or catching a snatch of half-heard conversation. Somehow, these moments make his paintings more believable, less smooth, carrying more of the texture of the day. It wouldn't work in any other medium.",

But his dancing-singing-acting chops are reminiscent of another former child star, Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nWhat caught our eye: He exudes a boyish charm onstage, but he can also convey the wisdom and emotional maturity of a 40-year-old. Both traits come in handy for his current role of Peter in \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d at the American Repertory Theater. His resume reads like that of a real pro: He played Michael Banks in \u201cMary Poppins\u201d on Broadway and played the Boy in \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d with stage legends Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. He hadn\u2019t read \u201cGodot\u201d before he landed the role, but he now understands its existential theme. \u201cThe Boy doesn\u2019t really have a personality, and you can\u2019t get information on him. I didn\u2019t step into him. I just stepped out of myself.\u2019\u2019\n\nLightbulb moment: \u201cWhen I was really, really little, I said, \u2018Mommy I want to be rich.\u2019 I just wanted to be famous. I went to this audition, and I freaked out and never wanted to do it again. Three million gagillion kids were going to audition to get a manager, and you had to read something. I was 4, and I couldn\u2019t read. We just left when it came to be my turn. But my friend Zach got me into it. I went to St. Louis and did a show [\u201cMary Poppins\u201d] at The Muny, and I had so much fun. That\u2019s when I knew I was meant to do it.\u201d\n\nBiggest thrill: \u201cWhen the curtain came up on the first show of \u2018Mary Poppins\u2019 on Broadway. That was the first professional show that I did.\u201d\n\nBiggest surprise: \u201cJust being able to play Peter. For some reason, it struck me that I really wanted to do this.\u201d\n\nInspired by: \u201cSteve Martin. I love, love \u2018The Pink Panther.\u2019 I met him once. I was like, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you speaking in a crazy French accent?\u2019 Also, my brother Alexander. He just turned 15.\u201d\n\nAspires to: \u201cPlay Major League baseball. I play shortstop, first base, and I pitch. I live sports.\u201d\n\nFor good luck: He doesn\u2019t have a ritual or token. \u201cI do my voice warm-ups, but that is not a special ritual. I\u2019m superstitious overall, but not when it comes to acting.\u201d\n\nWhat people should know: \u201cWhen I\u2019m acting, don\u2019t think, \u2018Oh, look, I\u2019m seeing Aidan.\u2019 I want you to see a character. When I\u2019m playing the violin in front of 25 people and I know half of them, I get really, really nervous. But when I\u2019m playing someone else, I can step into it and not get nervous. What is nice about doing Peter is that he was an actual person. I can step into that and be who he was as if I\u2019m actually living in 1904.\u201d\n\nComing soon: He\u2019s preparing for the transition to middle school after \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d ends its run at the ART on Sept. 28. \u201cIt\u2019s the first year of changing classes.\u201d",

The Wea\u00adther Bureau said winds of 115\u00adm.p.h. and higher could be ex\u00adpected after the eye passed.\n\nBrunswick, Ga., about 60 miles north of here, took a severe beating from.the massive storm, whose hurricane\u2010force winds\u2014more than 75 miles an hour\u2014ex\u00adtended 125 miles from its center.\n\nGales lashed the rest of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Hurricane warnings were up all the way to Charles\u00adton, S. C.\n\nWinds that reached a peak of 95 miles an hour and crashing waves wrecked seaside build\u00adings, flattened billboards, crum\u00adbled seawalls, ripped open piers and uprooted trees on the Flori\u2010da coast.\n\nAluminum light poles weaved, loose wires crackled and shin\u00adgles peeled off by the thousands. Ninety\u2010two per cent of Jack\u00adsonville was reported without electricity.\n\nRoofs of two motels in Bruns\u00adwick were badly ripped. The roof of another building was blown off. Windows were smashed. Debris littered the city's streets. Most of the power was out.\n\nGreat green arcs flashed in the darkness as power lines snapped and transformers blew.\n\nAfter wallowing off Florida's northeast coast for hours, the hurricane's large eye headed straight for St. Augustine push\u00ading a 10\u2010foot tide. The high tide was expected to spread far up the Georgia coast.\n\nThe Weather Bureau said the storm was headed generally to the west at seven miles an hour. It was expected to turn north\u00adward, then northwestward. That would take the hurricane and its predicted rains of up to 15 inches into southern Georgia.\n\nModerate to severe flooding was expected.\n\nWhitecaps raced down the narrow streets of 400\u2010year\u2010old St. Augustine, the nation's old\u00adest city. Water flowed hip\u2010deep at the ancient Slave Market Square, in the heart of the busi\u00adness district, the scene of racial violence this summer.\n\nWaves broke over what was left of the seawall at Jackson\u00adville Beach and rolled through the streets. An oceanfront beer and sandwich shop was de\u00adstroyed.\n\nAt least three structures were unroofed. Three others were un\u00addermined by waves.\n\nA palm tree was pitched through the front of a seaside restaurant. Waves threw debris into a tavern, crumbling its front.\n\nVirtually all power and most telephones were out. Residents who stayed in their, homes sat in darkness.\n\nNeither Jacksonville nor St. Augustine had ever been struck by the full force of a storm as big as the hurricane Dora, which was churning 200,000 square miles of sea, an area larger than New York and Cali\u00adfornia combined.\n\nIn St. Augustine, Charles Walker, Red Cross disaster chairman, called the hurricane \u201cthe most disastrous storm we've ever had.\u201d\n\nOld buildings being restored to their 16th\u2010century appearance were cut off by standing water. The Castillo de San Marcos, the oldest Spanish fort in the Unit\u00aded States, was surrounded by flood waters.\n\nIn front of the Monson Motor Lodge, where the Rev. Dr. Mar\u00adtin Luther King Jr. concen\u00adtrated his integration drive, water ran hubcap deep.\n\nOn the beachside, Tommy Cox, 69 years old, owner of the St. Augustine Beach Hotel, re\u00adported that waves had smashed through ground floors and \u201care pouring through my lobby.\u201d Most of the 3,000 other persons on the low\u2010lying peninsula had fled as the storm approached, but Mr. Cox elected to ride it out.\n\nSuspense had built up among coastal residents during yester\u00adday as the hurricane, expected ashore hours earlier, slowed to an eight\u2010mile\u2010an\u2010hour forward movement and then stalled. Civil Defense officials said 50,000 persons fled the Florida coastal area in the storm's path.\n\nSeas grew wild all along the Georgia coast and thousands of persons streamed out of ex\u00adposed homes near the beaches.\n\nLong before the first winds of the hurricane reached the shore, the storm had been blamed indirectly for three deaths.\n\nTwo fliers died when a plane they had intended to fly out of the storm's path crashed on take\u2010off from the Sanford Naval Air Station in Florida. A man disappeared and was presumed to have drowned while trying to retrieve a boat blowin loose from its mooring at Brunswick.\n\nThe resort city of Daytona Beach, Fla., expecting the full fury of the storm, escaped with an estimated $20,000 damage as the highest winds passed 100 miles offshore. Tides under\u00admined seawalls and ripped away parts of two piers.\n\nFor the second time in less than a month, Cape Kennedy, the missile center, had braced for a blow that did not come. The hurricane named Cleo had hit only lightly at the center, and the present storm could muster only 56\u2010mile\u2010an\u2010hour gusts at ground level as it passed offshore.\n\nWinds of 94 miles an hour\n\nThe Weather Bureau said the seas were \u201cphenomenal\u201d and were rapidly eroding the beaches.\n\nThe Red Cross said more than 200 disaster workers were on the job or on the way to coastal areas of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.\n\nAs the hurricane struck, President Johnson declared nine counties on Florida's lower east coast a major disaster area because of damage done by its predecessor, a hurricane desig\u00adpredecessor, Cleo.\n\nOut in the Atlantic, still an\u00adother hurricane, Ethel, remained almost stationary 350 miles south\u2010southeast of Bermuda.\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form.

At least one of Corvette\u2019s cool technical features, added for the 2015 version, is also illegal.\n\nGeneral Motors GM is warning owners of the new Corvette to refrain from using \u201cvalet mode\u201d in its performance monitoring system because recording anyone in the car without the person\u2019s knowledge and permission is against the law in many states.\n\nThe system, which can record speed, engine r.p.ms and g-forces during laps on a race track or on rally routes, allowed owners to monitor how another person drove the car, such as when it was being parked, serviced or cleaned. The feature included a voice recorder.\n\n\u201cHey, let\u2019s see what this thing can do\u201d might be one incriminating statement worth recording. \u201cHmm. I wonder what\u2019s in the trunk\u201d would be another.\n\n\u201cThink of it as a baby monitor for your car,\u201d said Harlan Charles, Corvette product manager. \u201cAnyone who has felt apprehension about handing over their keys will appreciate the peace of mind of knowing exactly what happened while their baby was out of sight.\u201d\n\nGM developed the performance data recorder with Cosworth, the British motorsports-engineering company that supplies the Corvette Racing team\u2019s data and telemetry electronics systems.\n\nBy entering a four-digit code for valet mode, the owner is able to disable the infotainment system, lock the glove compartment and begin recording the engine\u2019s performance, as well as the voice recorder. Later on, the recording data can be viewed on the car\u2019s video display or transferred to a computer.\n\nA GM spokesman, when asked what states specifically outlawed spy recordings, wasn\u2019t able to provide additional information. The automaker, notwithstanding the legal glitch, has been thrilled with Corvette\u2019s reception by consumers. Fielding a competitive sports car is an element of the automaker\u2019s recovery from its 2009 bankruptcy.\n\nRetail deliveries of the car in the U.S. totaled 2,679 in August, compared with 655 a year earlier. Through the first eight months of the year, Corvette sales reached 23,483, compared with 6,999 last year.\n\nAccording to Edmunds.com, the average retail price paid for a Corvette is about $67,000. That compares favorably to a Porsche 911 that starts at about $100,000. Increasingly, some sports car buffs say Corvette has narrowed the gap with the German sports car, in terms of performance and handling.\n\nGM says it is revising its software and thus will solve any legal problems encountered in some states by valet mode. Until then, Corvette owners might want to consider asking the attendants to park their vehicle near the entrance, in plain sight.",

Sears CEO Eddie Lampert is also its top shareholder\u2014his hedge fund ESL Investments owns 48.5% of shares.\n\nChief Financial Officer Rob Schriesheim said in a statement that if this happened, \u201cwe would realize substantial proceeds from such sale, which would further enhance our liquidity.\u201d\n\nThe potential move to extract cash out of its real estate is Sears\u2019 latest move to improve its finances in recent months, especially important ahead of the holiday season when it needs to reassure suppliers it can pay them. In October, it announced plans to lease space in some of its stores to fast-fashion company Primark as well as plans to raise $625 million in a debt rights and warrants offering. Prior to that, the retailer, which also owns the Kmart discount chain, announced plans to sell most of its stake in Sears Canada. All told those recent moves were expected to generate about $2 billion in cash by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nDeclining sales in recent years has led to a cash hemorrhage for Sears, which has closed dozens of stores in recent years.\n\nREITs must have most of their assets and revenue tied to real estate and pay out 90% of their taxable income as dividends, but generally don\u2019t pay corporate taxes, making them tantalizing for companies.

        "text": "\u201cPalo Alto,\u201d the new film written and directed by Gia Coppola, based on the short story collection of the same name by James Franco, wastes no time identifying itself as a study of well-off, angst-filled, directionless teenagers. There are no public records of how much money or angst Coppola and Franco have, but neither one of them is directionless.\n\nOver the past decade or so, Franco, 36, has jumped all over the place as an actor, from serious roles in the \u201cSpider-Man\u201d trilogy and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d for which he was Oscar nominated, to outright goofiness in \u201cPineapple Express\u201d and \u201cThis Is the End.\u201d He\u2019s directed almost two dozen shorts and features (\u201cBukowski\u201d and \u201cThe Sound and the Fury\u201d are due for release this year), he\u2019s an accomplished painter, is working on a PhD in English at Yale, and in 2010, just after completing an MFA at Columbia, had \u201cPalo Alto\u201d published.\n\nCoppola, 27, the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola, niece of Sofia Coppola, and cousin of extended Coppola family members Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman, earned a degree in photography at Bard College. But after getting her feet wet directing a few offbeat videos, she\u2019s now joined the ranks of the Coppola filmmaking dynasty by adapting and directing her first feature.\n\nFranco and Coppola shared a joint phone conversation from New York to discuss \u201cPalo Alto.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote the book when I was still at Columbia,\u201d said Franco. \u201cIt took me almost five years, and when it was finished, I started thinking about it as a movie. But I didn\u2019t want to adapt it myself. I was adapting other people\u2019s work, and I really like the kinds of things that come out of collaborations, and how material could go into new areas when different voices were brought it.\u201d\n\nFranco was introduced to Coppola around that time, saw some of her photos and videos, and believed she might be the right person to turn his book into a film.\n\n\u201cI thought she had the right spirit and the right sensibility,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just went with my instinct, called her up, and asked her if she wanted to adapt my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, first there was an e-mail,\u201d she said, \u201cand it was, \u2018Hey, nice to meet you; let\u2019s do a project together.\u2019 He presented a few different ideas, but \u2018Palo Alto\u2019 sounded the most interesting because even though I had just finished college, I already had enough separation to kind of look at it nostalgically, at least for the teenage years. When I read the book I fell in love with it; I hadn\u2019t seen anything that depicted teenagers in such an accurate way.\u201d\n\nBut she admits that before jumping onboard the project, there were a few butterflies, or at least some concern about dealing with being the newest Coppola in town.\n\nAsked if it\u2019s fun or a challenge to be a first-time filmmaker with that name, she said, \u201cI guess it\u2019s a little bit of both. There\u2019s definitely more pressure, from an outside perspective. But within my family it\u2019s fun. I admire all their movies, and it\u2019s nice to hear how they go about things, and talk to them in that sense.\n\nEmma Roberts in \u201cPalo Alto.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was worried about it a little bit,\u201d she added. \u201cAt first it wasn\u2019t appealing to me because it seemed a little scary, but filmmaking is sort of an extension of photography, with more elements to play with. So I couldn\u2019t help but feel comfortable in that environment. I grew up going to sets, so if feels very natural.\u201d (Note: Coppola can be seen as a 2-year-old in \u201cThe Godfather: Part III.\u201d)\n\nAlthough a couple of family members had small supporting roles in \u201cPalo Alto\u201d \u2013 her mom, Jacqui Getty, and her grandaunt Talia Shire \u2013 she made the film with the emotional support of other Coppolas, rather than any hands-on help.\n\n\u201cThey wanted me to find my own voice, to learn on my own and make my own mistakes along the way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut James produced it, so I had the advantage of being able to lean on him throughout the whole process.\u201d\n\nFranco also plays the supporting part of Mr. B, a high school teacher with an eye for the girls on the soccer team he coaches. And having adapted Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cChild of God\u201d and William Faulkner\u2019s \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d for the screen, Franco was always available to help Coppola adapt his writings.\n\nActors Nat Wolff (left), and Jack Kilmer in the film.\n\n\u201cThe main advice I gave her at the beginning was to just look at the book and think about the pieces and the moments and the characters that really struck her, and to start with those,\u201d he said. \u201cThe book is a collection of loosely connected stories, but they\u2019re also individual stories. I told her she didn\u2019t have to use all of them, just to pick the ones she wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames took me through the adaptation process, step by step,\u201d said Coppola. \u201cI picked the stories that I connected with the most, and then did separate screenplays.\u201d\n\nNow it was Franco\u2019s turn to interrupt her.\n\n\u201cGia\u2019s the one who really unified the stories and wove the different strands together,\u201d he said.\n\nFranco grew up in Palo Alto, and freely admits that there\u2019s more than a hint of autobiography in both the book and the film.\n\n\u201cYeah, Teddy, the character played by Jack Kilmer, is probably closest to me as far as what he\u2019s dealing with and his involvement in art classes and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Nat Wolff\u2019s character, Fred . . . there\u2019s nobody in my past that he\u2019s really based on, so I think I realized that he was sort of another side of myself, the darker side of myself. I guess both of those characters have a little bit of me in them.\u201d",

        "text": "Art, commerce and the internet may seem to have little in common but Hewlett-Packard is challenging expectations with a multimedia initiative spanning virtual and traditional media to woo the so-called \"iMac generation\". The computer giant has turned arts patron by opening a gallery in London's East End and online, and it's using the latest new media tools to spread the word.\n\nAs part of an initiative bluntly titled Hype, HP is inviting anyone to submit original, computer-generated art to be shown at a renovated brewery-turned-art gallery in Brick Lane. The idea is that artists turn up with an digital picture or short film on disc which will then be printed and hung or projected on to the gallery's walls. The catch? While \"art\" can be on any theme - so long as it's legal - to qualify for display every piece must somehow feature the letters H and P (and in that order). Once the walls are full - and for those not able to pop down to Brick Lane - work is also exhibited in a virtual art gallery online.\n\nAptly, Hype has been created by HP's advertising agency, Publicis, but don't call this advertising, says Mark Ellis, HP's business manager, who has overseen the project. Hype is a \"platform for the designers of tomorrow\", he explains, \"ensuring their work is acknowledged by their peers across the artistic and commercial worlds\".\n\nThe hype around Hype began nine months ago when a viral marketing campaign infiltrated more than 120 design-related internet sites, communities, weblogs and discussion forums.\n\nInformation packs and promotional materials were then distributed via a tie-up with the National Union of Students and at various art colleges. Underground events were also staged, such as an \"underground film night\" in a central London car park at which a series of specially commissioned short films were screened. A number of these films were commissioned by Publicis to encapsulate the Hype theme; others were selected from work already contributed by aspiring filmmakers in response to the awareness campaign. More advertising was then created to run in style and fashion magazines; Publicis worked with young, unknown artists who came up with the content.\n\nThe hypegallery.com website has played a central role in establishing the Hype brand, however. Initially, its role was to lead visitors through a virtual journey via sounds, images and film to explain the idea and explain to potential contributors how to get involved. The site was also designed, however, to enable contributors to submit work to Hype from anywhere in the world. Then, last month, hypegallery.com was transformed into a virtual art gallery as it began to showcase contributors' art.\n\nHP's strategy is intriguing. For a start, it represents what Publicis claims is \"significant expenditure\" by a global advertiser, on a campaign which includes no TV ads. What began with online viral advertising has led to HP establishing a database of target consumers whom it hopes to exploit. And it marks what is claimed to be the first UK use of \"hypertags\" - which enable posters to send information to the mobile phones of passers-by.\n\n\"HP wanted to position itself more at the forefront for the next generation of artists, filmmakers and photographers - a very sophisticated generation which is also highly cynical about advertising,\" says Chris Aldous, creative director at Publicis. \"So conventional advertising would not have worked; it just wouldn't have said anything different, interesting or relevant for these people.\"\n\nSimply sponsoring something wouldn't have been good enough, either. \"They needed to engage with their target audience and knew they could do so by encouraging a form of transaction: what young artists want most is exposure,\" he adds.\n\n\"The idea was that HP could provide that platform, and that it would do so in a far more effective way than your ordinary student show - by detailing the artist and their email contact details alongside every piece of art. This meant the website had to be as important as the physical gallery space, and it provided a way for them to set up their own online creative community.\"\n\nThe incentive for artists to participate is to have their work exhibited, to have their details publicised and then have both presented to leading figures in Britain's creative industries at an end of show bash when the Brick Lane space closes on February 19. Their work will live on, however, in the virtual gallery which, Publicis hopes, will become an enduring resource for creative agencies, publishers and commissioning editors.\n\nTo appeal to such a discerning audience, all forms of communication used by HP and Publicis had to be true to the Hype ethos, says Jon Williams, interactive creative director of Publicis' interactive division, Publicis Dialog. Which is why the agency was keen to incorporate hypertag technology. This involves an infra-red transmitter being embedded in posters. The poster requests passers-by to point their mobile phone at it and turn on the infra-red on their handset. The poster's transmitter then implants a calendar entry into the mobile phone's memory to remind the user to visit the gallery in Brick Lane.\n\nIn the campaign's initial stages Publicis worked with viral advertising specialist Cake to build awareness of Hype on the internet - a potentially high risk strategy. \"You can't just drop into a newsgroup and start butting in talking about your brand,\" Williams says. \"You have to get to know the community first, then pick your moment. You have to be engaging, and you have to offer something in return.\" The slow build of the Hype campaign over a number of months shows \"how online values can have a fundamental impact on multimedia advertising campaigns\", he claims.\n\nThe effectiveness of all this, however, is less easily demonstrated. The website has received just under 2.5m hits since it went live early last month and more than 1,200 pieces of original artwork have been submitted; 900 pieces of art are displayed via the website. Meanwhile the Brick Lane gallery, with hanging space for 380 pieces, is full and earlier submissions are being moved to the online gallery to make way for new ones. But it's too early to gauge how commercially valuable HP's new-found friends among Britain's young artists will be.\n\nDespite this, HP is considering extending Hype to Berlin, Barcelona and Paris.",

This past summer, Goop collaborated with Diane von Furstenberg on several pieces, including two dresses and a jumpsuit that were sold exclusively on Goop.com.\n\nGersh says Goop has opportunities to grow in many areas, including beauty and home as well as apparel. \u201cGoop crosses a bunch of different categories,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re deciding where to go first.\u201d\n\nAppropriately for a lifestyle partnership-in-the-making, Paltrow offered Gersh the Goop CEO job over a home-cooked dinner in early June. \u201cGwyneth invited me over to her house in LA for dinner, which she pulled off effortlessly,\u201d says Gersh. Over \u201can amazing chicken stir-fry\u201d and salmon with hoisin sauce, the two women brainstormed what Goop\u2019s future might look like with Gersh at the helm. (At one point, they were \u201cappropriately interrupted by a call for homework help\u201d from Paltrow\u2019s two grade school-aged children, Gersh recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s real life.\u201d)\n\nPaltrow started Goop in 2008 in London, where she lived with her husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. The couple split (or more famously, \u201cconsciously uncoupled\u201d) last March; three months later Paltrow moved Goop to Los Angeles and realized she needed to hire a U.S.-based CEO. Paltrow and Gersh met, actually, through another lifestyle entrepreneur, fitness guru Tracy Anderson, last year. Following her exit from Martha Stewart, Gersh was helping Anderson find a CEO for her business; she and Paltrow, who is a friend of Anderson and an aficionado of her intense exercise regimens, bonded over being \u201ctwo entrepreneurial working moms,\u201d Gersh says.\n\nWhile their lifestyles now may seem to be in sync, Paltrow and Gersh started out completely different. Paltrow, 42, was raised in Manhattan by her renowned actor parents, Blythe Danner and the late Bruce Paltrow, and attended the tony Spence school. Gersh, 55, grew up in the Bronx, where her dad owned a fabric and needlepoint store and struggled to make ends meet. Gersh went to public school and put herself through college\u2014SUNY Binghamton\u2014and law school at Rutgers.\n\nA challenging childhood\u2014working since she was 12 years old\u2014instilled in Gersh a fierce ambition to succeed. She co-founded Oxygen Media with Geraldine Laybourne in 1998 and served as president and COO there until NBC Universal bought the company in 2007. She stayed on at NBCU as president of strategic initiatives for three years until Martha came calling.\n\nGersh\u2019s drive isn\u2019t limited to her business career. In September, she won the Liberty National golf club championship near her home in New Jersey. (She has a 10.2 handicap.) And like Paltrow, she\u2019s a Tracy Anderson fanatic\u2014she does the exercise regimen four days a week. Which makes you wonder, could Goop have big ambitions in the exercise business? That would be a good bet.",

        "text": "Call it a European miracle. Spain raised its 2013 GDP estimate by \u20ac26.2 billion (about $33.6 billion) to \u20ac1.05 trillion, a 2.5% boost.\n\nWhat\u2019s contributing to this good news? Illegal activities. Spaniards apparently consume \u20ac5.4 billion in illegal drugs and spend \u20ac3.8 billion on prostitutes, accounting for 0.87% of GDP.\n\nThe Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE), Spain\u2019s national statistics bureau, did not add illegal activities just for fun, however. As part of new EU regulations, member countries have to include the measurements. There are obvious motives for doing this. On a cynical level, using illegal activities to boost GDP could help some countries stay under deficit-to-GDP ratios mandated by the EU.\n\nOn a scientific level, measuring illegal activity allows for apples-to-apples comparisons between countries where drug use and prostitution are legal (and already measured) and others where they are not.\n\n\u201cIf you want to compare EU countries, it makes sense to harmonize the way you measure the size of the economies,\u201d says Diane Coyle, an economics professor at the University of Manchester in the U.K. and the author of GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History.\n\nAccording to the new measurements, the GDP share of illegal activities was 1% in Italy, 0.7% in U.K., and 0.4% and 0.2% in Portugal and Germany respectively.\n\nBut how accurate can these figures possibly be? The mere fact that the activities are illegal, or at least not legally registered, makes measuring them difficult to say the least.\n\nAndrew Oswald, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick, says that because of measurement difficulties, estimates of the illegal economy are likely off by at least 20-25%. \u201cPeople breaking the law don\u2019t often send in forms to the government.\u201d\n\nSo how do national statistics agencies estimate the market value of illegal activities? To put it simply, they extrapolate from what little data they have.\n\nTake Spain, where prostitution is something of a \u201csemi-legal\u201d activity. On the edges of most Spanish cities, one can find alterne clubs frequented by prostitutes and their customers. The clubs sell drinks and rent rooms, economic activities that can be measured, but the prostitutes are not registered and they don\u2019t report the income they earn in those rented rooms.\n\nSo in late 2013, statisticians from the INE contacted ANELA, a Valencia-based trade association for alterne clubs. The statisticians asked the association to estimate the average price for a visit to a prostitute; the number of services given per day; and the average rent collected per prostitute/day by alterne clubs for the years 2002, 2007, and 2012.\n\nAfter realizing that the questions weren\u2019t a joke, ANELA Marketing Director Jos\u00e9 Roca says for the three years he answered \u20ac50/\u20ac70/\u20ac40 per service to the first question, 6/8/4 times/day to the second. To the third, he answered a flat \u20ac50.\n\nBut those numbers were estimates at best, he says, and any GDP figures developed based on them would be inaccurate. \u201cIt\u2019s an approximation,\u201d he says of the INE\u2019s figures. \u201cYou can\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives at Hetaira, a Madrid nonprofit that works to protect the rights of sex workers, were similarly dubious when INE asked them for help estimating the number of prostitutes working in Spain.\n\n\u201cWe have only numbers of people who we help [about 1,000 per year]. It\u2019s very difficult to know how many people are involved because there is no registry,\u201d says Mari Carmen Fern\u00e1ndez, a social worker at Hetaira. \u201cWhat seemed surprising to us is that they use these numbers for the GDP, but they are not recognizing the rights of people who work in the industry.\u201d\n\nThe accuracy of GDP estimates for illegal economic activity will improve over time, and even more so if and when those activities are made legal and taxed. But for some economists, that may be missing the point.\n\nAlong with Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, the University of Warwick\u2019s Andrew Oswald is part of a school of economic thinkers who believe that GDP is an outdated measurement and that countries should instead measure the psychological wellbeing, or happiness, of their citizens.\n\n\u201cGDP served its purpose well. But modern life is different. The problem is not a lack of food,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the physical wants across Western Europe are essentially satisfied, so mental wellbeing is the criteria.\u201d\n\nHow prostitution and drugs contribute to that measurement is another question entirely.",

        "text": "\u201cI have a perfect wife, a daughter whom I love, a beautiful home, success at work,\u201d says Julien, the woe-begone adulterer in Mathieu Amalric\u2019s adaptation of Georges Simenon\u2019s 1964 novel, \u201cThe Blue Room.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has been paying attention to the battering that supposedly happy marriages have been taking on the screen lately will recognize that this is a formula for disaster. Amalric, who also plays Julien with a gnomish gloom, gussies up this seeming retread of \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and \u201cThe Postman Always Rings Twice\u201d with stylish visuals, a somber pace, a melodramatic soundtrack, and a narrative obliqueness that suggests depths that may or may not exist. Though engrossing and aesthetically admirable, at times the humorless artiness verges on absurdity. It\u2019s hard to take a film too seriously when plum jam and Bach\u2019s \u201cChaconne\u201d vie for equal cinematic significance.\n\nThe title refers to the rented room in which Julien and Esther (St\u00e9phanie Cl\u00e9au, who co-wrote the screenplay with Amalric) take time off from their spouses for languorous, graphic, and sumptuously photographed sex. It can also get a little rough, as Esther bites a chunk off Julien\u2019s lip at one point. Perhaps he should see this as a warning that the wages of sin are more than just the cost of a room in a no-tell hotel. For now, though, the only problem is explaining the wound to his wife, Delphine (L\u00e9a Drucker); but she\u2019s pallid and docile and doesn\u2019t ask questions. Only his spunky daughter asks why, and he offers the typical bumped-into-a-post excuse.\n\nThe questions get a lot tougher after Julien is incarcerated and interrogated for an undisclosed crime. The details emerge gradually over the film\u2019s slow-moving hour and a quarter, with Amalric inserting flashbacks as Julien undergoes grilling by a magistrate who doesn\u2019t mind violating some of the basic rules of judicial procedure, at least as seen on American TV shows. Maybe courts operate differently in France, or the defense lawyers are lousier. Be that as it may, the mystery is pieced together not so much as a who-done-what but as an existential dialectic on ennui.\n\nLess obscure is Amalric\u2019s obsession with the color in the title \u2014 it is more a film bleu than a film noir. Maybe he watched Krzysztof Kieslowski\u2019s \u201cBlue\u201d (1993) once too often, but, if so, he failed to learn from the late Polish auteur\u2019s masterpiece the virtues of subtlety and restraint. In Amalric\u2019s film, shades of blue are ubiquitous; even the wallpaper in the courtroom is a dingy azure. When applied so indiscriminately, the color doesn\u2019t have much meaning other than as a design motif, serving as a contrast to the bleached interior of Julien\u2019s house and the occasional dashes of orange and red (the latter most prominent in Esther\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s dye job, another reason not to like her).\n\n\u201cBlue Room\u201d demonstrates that, as a director, Amalric has begun to master the medium. Now he needs to work on expanding his palette.\n\n- Mathieu Amalric\u2019s \u2018Blue Room\u2019 period",

Dropped into a competitive Top 40 battleground trying its best to figure out how to incorporate dubstep and EDM, a body-positive call to arms wrapped up in girl-group duds with a hip-hop sheen stood out if only by sheer chutzpah alone. That Trainor\u2019s attitudes were as judgmental and dismissive as the ones that she was embraced for as an antidote to (albeit aimed in a novel direction) was immaterial. On pop radio, hooks can forgive just about anything, and \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d had them.\n\nFor better or for worse, \u201cTitle,\u201d Trainor\u2019s full-length debut, is more of the same. (In more ways than one, as it includes all four songs previously released as Trainor\u2019s preceding EP, also called \u201cTitle.\u201d) The Massachusetts-raised Nashville transplant doesn\u2019t always know quite what she\u2019s trying to say or how to say it, but she figures that she can sell it with little more than a smirk and a giddy bounce. In \u201cWalkashame,\u201d she expresses embarrassment at stumbling home the morning after, and then gets righteously indignant at the suggestion that she might have something to be embarrassed about. The sexual politics in \u201cDear Future Husband\u201d are a sitcom nightmare, demanding apologies after they fight even when she admits she\u2019s wrong, and dangling sex as an incentive.\n\nTrouble is, it\u2019s all just so infernally catchy. Of course, in the case of \u201cDear Future Husband,\u201d it\u2019s because she\u2019s simply stripped the lyrics from \u201cRunaround Sue\u201d \u2014 which admittedly had their own sexist streak \u2014 and pilfered the song\u2019s romping backbone seemingly whole, right down to the backing vocals and honking sax. But that\u2019s Trainor\u2019s gift and curse: She\u2019s a plunderer first and foremost. Built on not much more than a simple, percussive rhythm, \u201cBang Dem Sticks\u201d is more or less a rewrite of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d with a horn line that directly echoes Sheeran\u2019s vocal hook. She even steals from herself with \u201cLips Are Movin,\u201d which follows the formula of \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d to a tee, straight-up referencing her earlier hit at one point.\n\n\u201c3am,\u201d meanwhile, finds Trainor aping Katy Perry, in that it finds her aping Sara Bareilles. But instead of delivering a self-esteem anthem like \u201cRoar\u201d (or a someone else\u2019s esteem anthem like \u201cBrave\u201d), Trainor\u2019s song is quieter and more vulnerable, racked with self-doubt that can\u2019t just be sung away with a good pep talk in the mirror. When she steps away from pastiche, she struggles; John Legend comes through loud and clear on boilerplate ballad \u201cLike I\u2019m Gonna Lose You,\u201d while she could be anybody at all. At this stage in her young career, Trainor has sass and infectiousness, but it\u2019s all secondhand. And it\u2019s not the same as personality.

        "text": "For this latest iteration of \u201cExposure,\u201d the Photographic Resource Center at Boston University\u2019s annual juried exhibition, 194 photographers submitted work. Guest curator Kristen Gresh, of the Museum of Fine Arts, selected 13. Thirty-six of their photographs are on display. The show runs through July 26.\n\nMost are in color. A lot are big. Beyond that, the pictures are \u2014 happily \u2014 all over the map: from Boston and Somerville to Lebanon and Libya. Subjects include handsomely displayed handguns, quadrupeds of a certain age, Baltimore row houses, and expired photographic paper.\n\nOne of the pleasures of \u201cExposure\u201d is seeing connections emerge and multiply. Some connections are obvious. Keiko Hiromi\u2019s pair of vibrant photographs of Liberians share a continent with Kyle Meyer\u2019s pair of photographs from Swaziland. Come to think of it, they share the same continent (if little else) with Matthew Arnold\u2019s two large images from the Libyan desert of still-standing pillboxes and barbed wire from World War II. They recall Richard Misrach\u2019s desert photographs, only with an additional sense, sad and sere, of history\u2019s weight. Arnold calls his series \u201cTopography is Fate.\u201d These pictures suggest a further, grimmer title: \u201cWar is Enduring.\u201d\n\nMeyer\u2019s portraits of gay men in Swaziland are highly distinctive. He weaves wax print fabric into the digital print, making the resulting image almost abstract. More important, doing so conceals the identity of the sitter, since homosexuality is illegal in Swaziland. The intersection of danger and pattern recurs in the three examples here from Yorgos Efthymiadis\u2019s series \u201cDomesticated.\u201d Efthymiadis photographs guns against a background of carpet or brocade. It\u2019s easy to overlook the weapon until you see it \u2014 and then that becomes impossible.\n\nFor reasons thematic rather than formal, Meyer\u2019s pictures obviously relate to Zoe Perry-Wood\u2019s three portraits of attendees at the Boston Alliance of Gay & Lesbian Youth Prom. Their candid, forthright gaze is worlds away from the hidden faces of the men in Swaziland.\n\nThe issue of presentation informs Efthymiadis, Meyer, and Perry-Wood\u2019s work. So, too, with Susan Barnett\u2019s half-dozen pictures of T-shirt wearers seen from behind (what we wear is who we are?), and Rhea Karam\u2019s pair of pictures of wall murals and signs in the Middle East. In \u201cRed Cars,\u201d the title refers to what we see in the foreground. Behind the vehicles are a set of recurring images of political leaders and behind those images a flag and intriguing architectural space. The play of picture planes is arresting, even a bit unsettling, an effect abetted by the jagged line between shadow and light visible on a blank wall.\n\nTo be sure, the interplay of light and shadow underlies all photography. It\u2019s front and center in Dean Kessmann\u2019s \u201cTest Strips.\u201d These effectively abstract images are photograms, rendering incremental progressions from black to white or the reverse. If Morris Louis had abandoned his Stripe paintings for photography, the results might have looked like this.\n\nThe nature of photography, in this case its materiality, also draws David Wolf.

        "text": "If you\u2019ve been following nutrition (or Silicon Valley) news, you\u2019ve probably heard of Soylent, the milky meal replacement boasting all the nutrients you need\u2014in portable, swiggable form. Soylent CEO and founder Rob Rhinehart, who I interviewed a year ago, created Soylent because he thinks eating is \u201cinefficient\u201d and because he\u2019s just not that interested in food. Apparently he\u2019s not alone: His drink has earned a fan following, with packs of Soylent selling on Ebay for $115. And it\u2019s also earned some competition: Ambronite.\n\nWhat makes Ambronite different: Soylent is made of powdered supplements whereas Ambronite is an all-natural, organic meal-drink that uses pulverized real-food ingredients, says co-founder Simo Suoheimo, who lives in Finland. Ambronite\u2019s 20 blended ingredients include oats, walnuts, apple, spirulina, and seabuckthorn, and everything is organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, and with no artificial ingredients. One serving has 500 calories (you can always use just half), only four grams of natural sugar, 50% of your daily total fiber needs, and over half of your protein intake.\n\nLike the Soylent guys, Ambronite\u2019s creators developed their product because they\u2019re busy businessmen who were eating too much junk between meetings. \u201cWe wanted to make a product that has the best ingredients the planet has to offer,\u201d says Suoheimo. Unlike Rhinehart, though, Suoheimo says he loves cooking and he loves food.\n\n\u201cThis is not me giving you a multivitamin and saying you\u2019re all set,\u201d Suoheimo says. \u201cI am giving you the best, real ingredients out there, based on what we know about nutrition now.\u201d Instead of regularly replacing full meals with Ambronite, Suoheimo hopes his drink will replace things like protein bars, which are full of processed ingredients and sweeteners.\n\nWhat it tastes like: Ambronite starts as a greenish powder, and it\u2019s recommended you blend or shake it well. On my first try, I simply added the powder to a glass of water and attempted to blend it with a coffee stirrer. Bad idea. It was chunky, and tasted like nothing other than a hint of fishy spirulina. The second time, my editor brought me a bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice. I poured in the green powder and shook it until it looked like a smoothie. This time, it wasn\u2019t so bad. In fact, it was really pretty good\u2014though still a bit chewy.\n\nI had some colleagues try it too. \u201cIt tastes like a smoothie I made myself,\u201d said my coworker Kelly Conniff, commenting on the texture. Another coworker was truly surprised it didn\u2019t taste terrible.\n\n\u201cThis is not a chocolate smoothie,\u201d says Suoheimo. \u201cWe are really proud of these ingredients and we want you to taste them.\u201d\n\nAlthough I enjoyed it mixed in with orange juice, the sugar from juice kind of defeat the purpose of drinking something so healthy. Blending it with a frozen banana and some water might be better. Suoheimo says some customers use the powder in their baking or mixed into their curry.\n\nWhere it\u2019s available: Ambronite is still crowdfunding, although they reached their goal of $50,000 in less than a week. People pre-ordering online can get 10 meals of Ambronite for $89, which includes shipping to the United States.\n\nThe bottom line: Though I am forever an advocate for eating whole, real food, I\u2019m not turning my nose up at Ambronite just yet. Real ingredients over supplements is always the way to go, so I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve ditched the fake stuff. The team also relies on nutrition experts from the University of Helsinki, an institution known for it\u2019s dedication to food science. Still, there are no studies that show drinking your daily nutrients leads to better health, and there are other reasons for sitting down and sharing a meal that matter beyond your nutritional intake. I\u2019ll probably be sticking to food that doesn\u2019t come in a pouch, but if you want to try Ambronite for yourself, go for it. Just make sure you blend it really well.",

        "text": "02/09/2016 AT 09:20 AM EST\n\nThe Maryland Attorney General's Office and defense attorneys for Adnan Syed, the convicted murderer at the center of the popular podcast\n\n, rested their cases late Monday afternoon after four days of testimony in a hearing to determine if he will get a new trial.\n\nBoth sides are expected to make closing arguments Tuesday in a Baltimore courtroom before Judge Martin Welch. It is expected that the judge will issue a written opinion at a later date, court personnel told reporters.\n\nSyed is serving a life sentence for the murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999. At the time, the pair were seniors at Baltimore's Woodlawn High School.\n\nIn order to get a new trial, Syed's attorneys must convince Welch that Syed's former defense attorney not only made questionable decisions but that the defense was \"constitutionally deficient.\"\n\nCourtesy of Yusuf Syed / AP Photo\n\nOn Monday, Davis Irwin, a renowned Baltimore defense attorney and former US Attorney testified that the failure of Syed's original defense attorney, Maria Gutierrez, to contact a potential alibi witness shows \"she was ineffective and constitutionally so, I'm afraid.\"\n\nIrwin said Gutierrez, had a \"mandated duty\" to interview all alibi witnesses, including Asia McClain, a classmate of Syed's. Days after his arrest in February 1999, McClain said she wrote two letters stating she was with him in a public library after school during the time prosecutors say Syed was strangling Lee to death.\n\nSyed's original defense team knew of McClain's account, according to new evidence presented at the hearing. But they never contacted her, McClain testified last week.\n\nSyed's current defense team says this note came from Syed's former defense team and shows they knew that Asia McClain had been with Syed in the library\n\nIrwin testified that the failure to call McClain\n\n, adding that it \"takes away the confidence in the verdict.\"\n\nDeputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah has said it was a \"strategic decision\" on the part of Gutierrez not to call McClain.\n\nBut Irwin did not believe that theory to be credible. \"The potential alibi witness cried out to be investigated,\" Irwin said. \"You argued that is a strategic decision. That is no strategy.\"\n\nThe other aspect of Syed's request for a new trial is tied to cell phone evidence used to convict Syed.\n\nHis attorneys claim that cell tower data from two incoming calls used to place Syed in a park the night Lee disappeared, and where her body was later recovered, were inaccurate.\n\nAT&T had sent a fax cover sheet warning that incoming calls were not reliable to determine location, yet Syed's original attorneys as well as the cell phone expert used by the state never knew about the warning, his current defense says.\n\nThe fax cover sheet from AT&T\n\nOn Monday, an FBI cell phone expert testified that contrary to the AT&T warning, the cell tower data linking Syed to the area of Leakin Park was accurate, and that he backs the state's expert who testified at the 2000 trial.\n\nSpecial Agent Chad Fitzgerald said the records he saw are \"accurately reliable\" and that the analysis of AT&T engineer Abraham Waranowitz at the trial \"was very good and very thorough.\"\n\nHowever, Waranowitz signed a sworn affidavit last fall in which he wrote that had he been aware of the disclaimer \"it would have affected my testimony,\" and that he could not have said where a phone was located until he understood the reasons for the disclaimer.\n\nFitzgerald also accused C. Justin Brown, one of Syed's attorneys, of giving him manipulated cell phone records with cut off dates and times to review. \"It's offensive to me,\" Fitzgerald said, his voice rising.\n\nBrown responded by saying it was these very same cell records that Syed's original attorney was given to work with. \"If you can't understand it,\" Brown said, \"how in the world could Christina Gutierrez understand it?\"",

        "text": "It\u2019s not easy to impress a billionaire, but the Skyacht One \u2014 an $83m customized private jet that takes to new heights the notion of airborne opulence \u2014 just might leave a Saudi prince or Silicon Valley magnate totally gobsmacked.\n\nThe Skyacht is the brainchild of former Disney executive and experiential designer Eddie Sotto, founder of SottoStudios/LA. But the aircraft he imagined is anything but cartoonish. Using the Embraer Lineage 1000E business jet as a platform, the Skyacht\u2019s nautical- and navigation-themed interior fairly screams refined elegance and luxury \u2014 a high-flying paean to all things sumptuous and lavish.\n\nWhat does $83m buy? Think details like a handmade brass-and-marquetry clock inspired by the renowned 15th-Century studiolo built for the Ducal Palace in Gubbio, Italy. Fornasetti rugs. British campaign-style furnishings. Loads of embossed leather. Bejeweled controls made of engraved brass, gold, platinum and silver. Brass inlaid window bezels surrounded by planked-mahogany panels. Shagreen-covered chairs. Intelligent cabin lighting that changes colors according to the time of day. And a richly appointed captain\u2019s quarters (aka a bedroom) that would make a perfect lair for Captain Nemo Nemo \u2013 that is, if he\u2019d gone capitalist and made millions commercializing the Nautilus for undersea intercontinental travel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, so perhaps some of that leaked into the design,\u201d says Sotto, once named by TED founder Richard Saul Wurman as one of America\u2019s top 1,000 most creative people. \u201cIt\u2019s fitting because in nautical culture, Captain Nemo is the biggest disruptor \u2014 and innovator \u2014 of all.\u201d\n\nThe former senior vice president of concept design at Disney's Imagineering division, Sotto\u2019s creative bona fides just might be genetic; his grandfather was a scenic and portrait artist at MGM Studios and an aunt was a costume illustrator and designer at Paramount and Universal before landing at Disney.\n\nAs such, the Skyacht embodies Sotto\u2019s flair for cinematic, storytelling design and an affinity for authenticity. \u201cI felt something was missing in the private-jet experience,\u201d he says, noting that while many high-end aircraft are filled with elegant finishes and flourishes, they lack heart and soul \u2014 and a sense of story.\n\n\u201cThink of it this way: People of means drive cars like Bentleys and wear Cartier watches \u2014 items with a legacy of design that goes back generations,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut aircraft, being so new, rely more on elegance and less on richness of design or story.\n\n\u201cMy design process is more cinematic,\u201d he continues. \u201cI think like a movie director would think. I figure out what would elicit an emotional response \u2014 like \u2018Wow!\u2019 \u2014 and move backward from there. Call it form follows feeling.\u201d\n\nMy design process is more cinematic. I think like a movie director would think. I figure out what would elicit an emotional response \u2014 like \u2018Wow!\u2019 \u2014 and move backward from there. Call it form follows feeling.\n\nAs the Skyacht\u2019s name implies, Sotto found his design muse, oddly enough, in the classic wooden motor yachts of the mid-1900s, like the Chris-Craft Riviera. That inspiration is reflected in the belly of the Skyacht\u2019s fuselage and on its stabilizer, which feature hand-painted faux mahogany \u201cplanks\u201d that mimic those boats of yesteryear.\n\nSotto was inspired by one boat in particular: the Thunderbird, built in 1940 for millionaire playboy and real-estate mogul George Whittell Jr to use at his Thunderbird Lodge on Lake Tahoe. The Thunderbird\u2019s DNA emerged from the gleaming fuselage of Whittell\u2019s personal airplane, a classic Douglas DC-2, also called Thunderbird.\n\n\u201cThe fact that George Whittell built a yacht to match his plane and it came out so beautiful taught me that those two worlds are closer than you think,\u201d Sotto says. \u201cI found it very exciting to think about a yacht that can fly.\n\n\u201cThe romance of those classic yachts with their planks and joinery \u2014 the way they\u2019re built, with all the engineering exposed \u2014 is timeless,\u201d he says, \u201cThe craftsmanship is literally right before your eyes. Every line is an elegant sculptural element. Every plank of wood serves an aerodynamic purpose \u2014 they\u2019re put together like a watch in a very precise way.\u201d\n\nAside from vintage motor yachts, the qua sine non of the Skyacht\u2019s design is the romance of Old World travel and navigation, as evidenced by the astrolabes, armillary spheres, charts and other navigational elements that repeat throughout the interior, right down to the Piero Fornasetti gold-plated dinner china. Those elements represent yet another nod to Sotto\u2019s passion for authenticity and storytelling, which he says creates a far more emotional design than merely designing a building or a trendy interior.\n\nSotto says the Skyacht is aimed directly at people \u201cwho love disruption \u2014 who like to see impossible things happen. At Disney, I learned that impossible is not a barrier, it\u2019s just a checkpoint.\u201d The Skyacht has generated interest from confidential clients, but Sotto expects that customers will change the cabin configuration as designed and personalise the interior. \u201cThe $83m is a number that safely delivers what you see,\u201d he says. \u201cBut customers will want to make changes in a bespoke way. This is merely a platform design \u2014 an invitation to dream.\u201d Or wish upon a star.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this or anything else you have seen on BBC Autos, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Both the hospital and the health department are named as defendants.\n\nThe suit is the latest in a string of aggressive steps by the friends group to halt the proposal, including an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the attorney general that the hospital must be required to keep the garden in perpetuity.\n\nThe objections center around the hospital\u2019s plan to build an 11-story tower on the site of the Prouty Garden, a half-acre patch that for decades has served as a place of solace for families struggling with serious illness.\n\n\u201cBottom line, we allege that Boston Children\u2019s Hospital jumped the gun,\u201d said Greg McGregor, a Boston attorney representing the group.\n\nThe friends group has brought the hospital project \u2014 and the garden\u2019s significance \u2014 to the attention of a wider audience beyond patients\u2019 families and doctors. An online petition to preserve Prouty has amassed about 16,000 signatures, and organizers have mobilized Saturday morning vigils outside the hospital during the month of April.\n\nIn addition to an injunction, the lawsuit requests that the state consider classifying the garden as important clinical space, not just a place of sentimental significance. A hearing on the injunction has been set for May 3.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Public Health said in a statement that health officials will review the lawsuit, but declined to comment on specifics, citing the department\u2019s policy on litigation.\n\nIn a statement, Children\u2019s also declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, citing the hospital\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cFor more than three years, Boston Children\u2019s has pursued our project to build a clinical building on our Longwood campus to meet the needs of our patients and staff and the growing demand for our care,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThroughout the public process we\u2019ve earned approval at every step of the way.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to state public health officials dated April 8, an attorney for the hospital denied the opposition\u2019s claims that the hospital has already begun work on the project. The letter stated that any work currently happening on the property is unrelated.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s proposed new tower at its 300 Longwood Ave. campus would include a pediatric heart center, neonatal intensive care unit, and private rooms. Hospital executives have previously said that the use of Prouty Garden land will help address overcrowding and create more room for doctors and nurses to treat patients.\n\nTo make up for the loss of Prouty Garden, hospital officials plan to open an 8,000-square-foot garden on the 11th floor of Children\u2019s main building in 2017.",

        "text": "Over the last two months, I\u2019ve spent countless hours sifting through 50,000 photos and videos my wife has captured throughout our eight-year marriage.\n\nIt was an enlightening experience to re-live old memories, but also see how far smartphone camera functions have come over the years.\n\nAfter the sorting process was complete, I set out to find the perfect online storage solution. The benefits of using a cloud-based storage system are two-fold: Viewing photos (and videos) online is easier than other methods, because they can be accessed on more than one device, and the service acts as an extra backup (you can never have too many).\n\nThe first photo-storage service I tested was Dropbox. The company offers storage plans that range from free for two gigabytes of storage, to $10 per month for up to 1 terabyte. Though free users can earn extra storage by completing random tasks, such as connecting a Facebook account or enabling Camera Upload features on his or her mobile devices. Currently, I have 80.8 gigabytes of free storage thanks to such promotions and offers.\n\nDropbox DROPBOX also offers applications across most platforms, all of which automatically backup your photos and videos without any extra work.\n\nAfterwards I looked at Flickr, once a staple for online photo storage. The company has had to go to great lengths to remain attractive to users, such as providing one free terabyte of storage to every user.\n\nOnce considered a premium feature, now-a-days anyone with a Flickr account can upload years of photos with little effort and without spending a single penny. Using a combination of iOS, Android, and desktop applications (OS X and Windows), users can automatically\u2014and privately\u2014upload photos to the service.\n\nAfter installing the Flickr Mac app and directing it to where my 500 gigabyte photo library was stored, the app scanned my folders and began automatically uploading photos. A surprising feature of the app was that it identifies duplicate photos, automatically skipping them during the upload process. It turns out I had nearly 4,000 duplicate photos in my library.\n\nOne drawback, however, is that the service only uploads photos (unlike its competitors), forcing me to use the website to manually upload videos.\n\nApple\u2019s iCloud Photo Library was recently released through a pair of updates to iOS and OS X, removing the beta tag it had carried for the better part of a year.\n\nThe service can sync photos and videos stored on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to your iCloud account, making your entire library available across all of your iCloud connected devices.\n\nThe obvious benefits for someone surrounded by Apple AAPL products is the seamless integration. Content is automatically uploaded, then easily downloaded with the push of a button: Simply open the photo app on any one of your Apple devices and your photos are available to peruse.\n\nThose with large photo libraries can opt to store smaller, more storage-friendly previews of content on devices to maximize device storage.\n\nThe iCloud Photo Library is the most expensive of the services I looked at: Plans start at free for five gigabytes of space, going all the way up to $20 per month for one terabyte of storage.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Cloud Drive offers unlimited photo storage to Prime members ($99 for the year), but requires users pay $60 per year in order to store videos that go beyond a 5 gigabyte limit.\n\nAfter uploading a small album and struggling to make sense of the web interface, I decided against using the service. Amazon\u2019s AMZN site was hard to navigate, and downright confusing. I soon realized trying to jump between folders and online albums was more work than it should be.\n\nGoogle GOOGL recently launched a new Photos service. So far, I\u2019ve only uploaded small albums for testing purposes, but found the system\u2019s search capabilities far superior than others. The ability to search for something like, say, a pumpkin, and find several photos of my children and I carving pumpkins is mind boggling. Sweetening the pot, Google has also given users unlimited storage space for high-resolution photos and videos.\n\nDespite having tested Google Photos for only a brief amount of time, I\u2019ve decided to go all in. Being able to search for what a photo contains, instead of arbitrary time frames or geo-location data, is what really sold me.\n\nIn the end, the best part about having so many photo storage systems available (short of the time needed to invest in uploading a large library) is I can easily switch between services should my needs change or a service not live up to its promise. We\u2019re lucky to have so many viable options for safekeeping of the precious and sometimes not-so-precious memories we capture on a daily basis.",

        "text": "The mystique of Miles Davis was rooted in the sinister magnetism of his character as much as it was in the nocturnal genius of his music. His nickname was \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019, and in the \u201850s he was a hypnotic reptile of cool, with sunken cheeks and a killer stare that said, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u201d By the late \u201870s and \u201880s, with his tangle of long hair, regal-pimp wardrobe, and iconic rasp (the result of raising his voice too soon after a throat operation), he\u2019d become a deeply transgressive figure, infamous for his drug abuse and violence against women, with a dissolute rock star\u2019s mystery and danger. He seemed like some magnificent creature that had crawled out of a swamp \u2013 the ultimate midnight badass.\n\nMiles Ahead, a free-form biopic directed by its star, Don Cheadle, is a passionate jumble of a movie, a heady plunge into Miles Davis\u2019 persona that doesn\u2019t always bother to make sense of what he did or why he did it. At the center of the film is Cheadle, who slithers deep inside the croaky Davis charisma. Eddie Murphy on Saturday Night Live once memorably compared Davis to a Gremlin, but Cheadle, with lethally pursed lips and iceberg eyes, gets beyond the comic kitsch and recreates the fabled Davis mannerisms in all their ferocity: the stare that turns every encounter into a showdown, the rasp as quietly threatening as Don Corleone\u2019s. Damned if he doesn\u2019t make the man as fascinating as he really was.\n\nThe film opens in the late \u201870s, when Davis, holed up in his townhouse on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, has become a scraggly hermit who has spent the last five years in seclusion without performing or issuing any new recordings. He has now made one, though: a secret session at Columbia Records that has yielded a tape the company wants, and which winds up being stolen from Davis during a party at his home. His attempts to get it back \u2013 a wild downtown car chase, showdowns at gunpoint \u2013 are the frame for this raucous, frazzled section of the movie, which at many points had me siding with Columbia. The company owns the tape, which Davis treats as a rare artefact of his timeless genius. But is that his jazz purity speaking, or it just his crazed, drug-fueled ego? Watching Miles Ahead, we can scarcely separate the two.\n\nThe movie keeps leaping back to the \u201860s, when Davis, having made the 1959 cool-jazz epiphany Kind of Blue (now the best-selling recording in the history of jazz), had become a superstar. What he chooses to do with his freedom and clout is to lord it over everyone in his midst \u2013 and that includes the love of his life, Frances Taylor, played by Emayatzy Corinealdi as an elegant baby doll out of a Mad Men daydream. Taylor is a gifted dancer who Davis marries and then wants to possess. He forces her to stop dancing and rubs his womanising right in her face. And when she protests, he beats her up. Why?\n\nIn contrast to a great biopic like Get on Up, which rooted James Brown\u2019s inexcusable behavior in his complex reaction to racism and his own childhood abandonment, Miles Ahead lacks any true psychology. It basically says: Davis was a raging tyrant \u2013 deal with it! The spectacle of his bad behavior can be horribly transfixing, as bad behavior in biopics so often is, yet the movie needed to give us a richer sense \u2013 some sense \u2013 of the source of his demons.\n\nDavis\u2019 ultimate act of heartbroken fury is to withhold his talent from the world\n\nIt\u2019s the late-\u201870s Miles, for all the slapdash staging of this section of the movie, who we can relate to the most, because there\u2019s a vulnerability that keeps peeking through his tattered facade. He hooks up with a disheveled reporter (Ewan McGregor) who wants to do his comeback story for Rolling Stone, and while this feels like the creakiest device imaginable, Cheadle and McGregor actually develop a compelling chemistry. As the reporter helps Davis score some drugs from a dorm-room dealer, then heads back to Miles\u2019 place for a late-night confessional coke binge, we begin to see that Miles Ahead is really a comedy of depression. The Davis we see has made a mess of his life, and he\u2019s suffering for it, but his ultimate act of heartbroken fury is to withhold his talent from the world \u2013 to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve me.\u201d Can he get over himself?\n\nIn the end, he does, though I wish we\u2019d seen with greater precision how it happened. The closing credits feature Cheadle\u2019s Miles in concert during the early \u201880s, wearing a leather jacket with an insignia that says #SocialMusic. \u201cSocial music\u201d is the term that Miles thinks should be used instead of jazz (\u201ca made-up word,\u201d he says derisively), but all I could think was: nothing was marked with a hashtag in the \u201880s! Surely Cheadle knows this, but the idea seems to be that as a filmmaker, he can be as loose and improvisatory as he wants to be. He may even think that he\u2019s working in the spirit of jazz. But biographical dramas, unlike jazz, need to be grounded in reality. And Cheadle\u2019s performance, while it makes Miles Ahead worth seeing, should have been grounded in a more focused and tough-minded movie.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

        "text": "As Donald Trump\u2019s position at the front of the Republican presidential race has become more and more unshakeable, the media\u2019s attitude towards him has changed gradually from a position of somewhat gleeful ridicule to concern that this man actually has a shot at becoming president of the United States\u2014and that the media itself may have helped put him there.\n\nThe latest example of this theme (one that I explored in a recent post here at Fortune) can be seen in a recent piece by New York Times columnist Nick Kristof, entitled \u201cMy Shared Shame: The Media Helped Make Trump.\u201d In it, the NYT writer says that he and the media are complicit in Trump\u2019s rise, in part because many mainstream outlets gave him so much free coverage during the race, even when he didn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nI polled a number of journalists and scholars, and there was a broad (though not universal) view that we in the media screwed up. Our first big failing was that television in particular handed Trump the microphone without adequately fact-checking him or rigorously examining his background, in a craven symbiosis that boosted audiences for both.\n\nAnn Curry, the former Today show anchor, tells Kristof that \u201cthe media has needed Trump like a crack addict needs a hit,\u201d because he is a ratings gold mine. This view was corroborated recently by CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves, who told a media conference that Trump has been a boon for the TV industry. \u201cThis is going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It\u2019s a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Data Sheet, Fortune\u2018s technology newsletter.\n\nAccording to one recent estimate, Trump has been the beneficiary of close to $2 billion in free media coverage since his campaign began. TV networks have spent more time showing an empty podium or a Trump headshot during his phone interviews than they have on most of the rest of the Republican field. CNN\u2019s ratings have climbed by 170% since the race began.\n\nKristof goes on to say that the media also made a number of other crucial tactical mistakes when it comes to Trump, and the first was to see him as a carnival clown. \u201cThe media made a mistake by covering Trump\u2019s candidacy at the start as some sort of joke or media prank,\u201d Harvard political scientist Danielle S. Allen tells the NYT columnist. The Huffington Post famously tried to cover Trump\u2019s campaign only in its entertainment section, although it eventually had to drop that idea.\n\nAt least part of the reason why Trump was seen as a joke\u2014even after it was obvious that he had a broad level of support\u2014is that most mainstream media outlets underestimated his appeal with U.S. voters. \u201cWe failed to take Trump seriously because of a third media failing: We were largely oblivious to the pain among working-class Americans and thus didn\u2019t appreciate how much his message resonated,\u201d Kristof argues, and it\u2019s hard to disagree.\n\nCNN media analyst Brian Stelter, host of the show Reliable Sources, spent most of his broadcast on Sunday talking about how the media missed the boat on Trump, and how this was at least in part because of a certain snobbery on the part of mainstream media analysts and journalists.\n\nThe bogus \"media created Trump\" meme is just another way elites are not taking Trump seriously.\n\n\u2014 Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) March 27, 2016\n\nOne of the central questions raised by all of this media second-guessing and hairshirt-wearing is this: Could the media really have altered the overall trend of Trump\u2019s rise to prominence and his possible nomination as Republican candidate? If TV shows hadn\u2019t given him so much coverage, or had challenged his erroneous statements more directly, or pointed out his obvious flaws as a president, would that have changed anything?\n\nWe\u2019ll never know the answer to that, because we can\u2019t un-bake the Trump cake. But not everyone is convinced that different media coverage would have resulted in a different outcome. For one thing, even when Trump\u2019s misstatements and racist commentary are singled out or highlighted as a problem, his support never seems to waver. If anything, it grows.\n\nTrump media coverage debate, solved: He is impervious to media criticism, so doesn't matter.\n\n\u2014 Peter Kafka (@pkafka) March 27, 2016\n\nIn a very real sense, regardless of what kind of coverage he and his policies are given by the mainstream press, Trump wins, at least in the eyes of his supporters. If he gets fawning coverage, then it\u2019s obvious how great a candidate he is. If he gets critical coverage, then it\u2019s obvious that he was right about the untrustworthy liberal media\u2014something he routinely criticizes at his rallies\u2014and he still wins.\n\nWatch: \u201cWe want to make media for the way the world is today.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also more than a touch of hubris in the idea that the media has somehow \u201cmade\u201d Donald Trump what he is, or convinced millions of people to support him. The mainstream press might like to think that it has that kind of influence and power over people, the way it theoretically used to, but that\u2019s probably not the case in today\u2019s decentralized media environment.\n\nIn many ways, Trump is a post-media candidate. His Twitter stream, his behavior at presidential debates, his use of radio and TV to push his views through the press who cover those events (which they have to do as professional journalists, as Jeff Zucker of CNN has pointed out in his defense of the network\u2019s Trump coverage) are all carefully calculated.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Trump\u2019s status as a media entity in his own right has been cemented by a captive media industry, desperate for revenue\u2014and not just TV, but plenty of online outlets as well. Is the media alone to blame for his appeal? No. But the early failure to take him seriously let Trump set his own agenda, and the wall-to-wall coverage since then has reinforced the impression that he is unstoppable.\n\nThe mainstream press helped to create this political bed, and now they are being forced to lie in it, and are complaining about how uncomfortable it is.",

CEO Michael Pearson had to announce the company missed analysts\u2019 profit targets\u2014Valeant added an extra stumble with a $600 million earnings typo in its press release\u2014and the fact that those results were unaudited. But Pearson made the situation worse with a lack of specificity about the company\u2019s ability to improve its numbers, and the announcement that its annual report, with audited numbers, would not be released any time soon, possibly triggering a breach of its bond agreements. Following the call, Valeant\u2019s already-ailing stock price collapsed, dropping by 51% before trading up 3%, to about $35, on the morning of March 16.\n\nPearson also managed to slag his company\u2019s new partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance, accusing it of not adequately communicating the terms of its partnership with Valeant, under which Walgreens will sell some of the drugs formerly distributed by the now-defunct Philidor. Said Pearson on the conference call: \u201cI think Walgreens did not do a very good job explaining [how the program worked] and then there were aspects of the Walgreens programs that people didn\u2019t like. So I think we\u2019ve done a better job explaining.\u201d\n\nWhat Pearson neglected to mention was that Walgreens, led by global deal-master Stefano Pessina, basically saved Valeant\u2019s bacon by picking up the distribution of many drugs that, without Philidor, would have no outlet. And Pessina made it clear back in January, in an interview with me, that Valeant\u2019s drug prices would sell for lower prices than before\u2013and that he was quite pleased with the terms. Says Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting: \u201cIt shows Pessina and his team negotiating a better deal.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Valeant seems to have rethought its earlier comment. When asked to elaborate on its criticism, Laurie Little, Valeant\u2019s SVP and head of investor relations, sent Fortune the following statement: \u201cAs we said on the call yesterday, our branded access program with Walgreens is off to a terrific start. While there was an initial reaction to the program from some payers, we and Walgreens have been working to explain the features of the program to our channel partners and to address any concerns they may have had. Walgreens is an outstanding partner, and we look forward to continuing our mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d\n\nIn response to this statement, Walgreens has decided to take the high road, it appears. Says a spokesperson: \u201cWe agree the program is off to a good start. We also were pleased that Valeant addressed some initial concerns from some payers regarding their program and it has been positively received.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s a lesson in there: when you\u2019re down, maybe don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.",

Even odder, the song in question is nearly 50 years old.

In fairness, he has latched on to a couple of reasonable, if not very original, issues \u2013 we could use better broadband, for example. But his 10-point plan mostly consisted of re-heated 1960s-style state-sponsored corporatism of the kind that was already completely discredited three decades ago, mixed up with some of the hard-left socialism that has turned Venezuela into a basket-case. His plan would certainly transform Britain, just as he promises \u2013 but unfortunately only by creating mass unemployment and national bankruptcy.\n\nCorbynomics was a snappy phrase. But even after Corbyn was installed as leader of the Labour Party last autumn, it didn\u2019t have much substance to it.

Some policy makers have also complained that banks are not lending enough and might be paying their executives too much.\n\nSince the Treasury Department introduced its plan, officials have stressed that their goal was to strengthen healthy banks and get them to revive their lending. Officials are also encouraging the takeovers of sick banks by healthy ones, as they did last week when the Treasury approved the bailout program\u2019s purchase of $7.7 billion of preferred shares in PNC Financial Services and rejected an application from National City Bank, based in Cleveland. National City quickly agreed to a takeover by PNC.\n\nBut the focus on healthy banks has created baffling contradictions. Healthy banks have been reluctant to take the government money, in part because they feared being stigmatized as needy or vulnerable.\n\nMr. Paulson essentially strong-armed several of the country\u2019s biggest banks into participating when he announced the program earlier this month.\n\nTo attract healthy banks into the program, Treasury officials also imposed as few restrictions as possible for those that received money. Banks could still keep paying dividends. They had only limited restrictions on executive bonuses and compensation. And the government would not force the banks to make loans they did not want to make.\n\nBut that only raised the question: why was the government trying to give those banks money in the first place?\n\nAndrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, sent letters to the nine biggest financial institutions on Wednesday, demanding a \u201cdetailed accounting\u201d of the next round of bonuses they planned to pay.\n\nMr. Yingling said many healthy banks might want to take advantage of the Treasury\u2019s offer, but not if they had to suspend dividends or accept restrictions on executive pay.\n\n\u201cIt would make no sense for a well-capitalized bank with solid earnings to agree to a program which would greatly lower the value of its stock,\u201d Mr. Yingling wrote.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Some Banks May Tell U.S. to Keep Bailout Cash.

        "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing where I don\u2019t need to think about the outfits that much anymore,\u201d she added.\n\nEgos abound on both sides of the celebrity styling business as the architects of A-list facades have gained followings to rival their clients (see: Jen Atkin, Kardashian tress tamer). Stylists have publicists. Tag teams are rare. But joining forces in 2007 allowed Mr. Zangardi and Ms. Haenn, both former stylists for MTV\u2019s on-air personalities, to play up their different strengths and sensibilities. Ms. Haenn veers toward hip-hop (her first styling job was on the set of the video for Trick Daddy\u2019s \u201cTake It to da House\u201d). Mr. Zangardi is more pop: \u201cMandy, Britney, Christina Aguilera, the boy bands,\u201d he said the other day over coffee with Ms. Haenn at the Soho House here in West Hollywood. Ms. Haenn grew up in Brooklyn, Mr. Zangardi in Ohio.\n\n\u201cMariel is the bad cop,\u201d Mr. Zangardi said.\n\nMs. Haenn said: \u201cLook, I\u2019m comfortable being like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not my favorite,\u2019 or, \u2018No, I don\u2019t like that,\u2019 even if they do. They get used to getting that from me and getting what Rob brings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ohio versus New York,\u201d Mr. Zangardi said.\n\nTheir first joint effort was styling Rihanna\u2019s 2007 \u201cUmbrella\u201d music video, which featured computer-generated water splashes and a series of good-girl-gone-bad ensembles (a leather romper, a low cut baby-doll dress). More work for the singer followed: a horned headpiece from Rihanna\u2019s \u201cRockstar 101\u201d video sits on a shelf in the duo\u2019s studio here, though Rihanna is no longer a client. In 2009, Andrea Lieberman, a stylist whom Ms. Haenn looked up to, moved away from longtime clients like Ms. Stefani and Ms. Lopez to start her own clothing line, A.L.C. Ms. Lieberman said she was relieved to see her star clients end up working with a strong team.\n\n\u201cIt was important to me that when I left both women, they were in supremely good hands,\u201d Ms. Lieberman said about Ms. Stefani and Ms. Lopez. \u201cI knew Rob and Mariel had it. They seamlessly could edit the best of the world of fashion with the world of music and had an incredible work ethic. It was a no-brainer for me to suggest them both to Jennifer and Gwen.\u201d\n\nMs. Lopez recalled her first meeting with Ms. Haenn and Mr. Zangardi, in 2011. \u201cI found them to be shy and kind of quiet, but they had their point of view,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started working together, little by little, and it worked really well. Those things you can\u2019t really force, you have a sensibility or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Zangardi and Ms. Haenn have since scripted many head-turning moments for Ms. Lopez: the mustard colored, cape-capped Giambattista Valli gown she wore to the Golden Globes in January, the crystal-studded Dsquared2 bodysuit she opened the American Music Awards with in 2015. The bodysuit was displayed in a glass case, along with Ms. Lopez\u2019s other sartorial hits (that green Versace dress), outside a recent \u201cAll I Have\u201d performance in Las Vegas. Mr. Zangardi was there to ensure that the array of outfits Ms. Lopez would wear that night were ready for the spotlight. \u201cShe\u2019s sliding on the floor in boots that are rhinestone that we have to recrystal every day,\u201d he said. (Ms. Haenn was in Japan with Ms. Stefani.)\n\nThey work out of a windowless, fluorescent-lit studio, jazzing up dancers\u2019 mall-bought outfits with safety pins and sequins (the budget for the backup crew is not what it is for marquee performers). In the back, a dozen bins of Spanx are stacked next to racks of old costumes worn by Ms. Lopez and Shakira, a former client. Despite the modest digs, clients like Ciara, Cara Delevingne, Rachel McAdams and Emily Ratajkowski often drop by to try on clothes.\n\nAt a recent fitting for the backup dancers on Ms. Stefani\u2019s tour, Ms. Haenn, Mr. Zangardi and their in-house tailor, Anna Kenaraki (poached, with blessings, from Ms. Lopez), bopped along to reggaeton and debated the merits of side versus back zippers (back zippers, Ms. Haenn said, are less likely to get stuck during a frantic midconcert costume change). They discussed the sartorial effects of \u201cbum flaps,\u201d rectangles of fabric that frame the hips of Ms. Stefani and her dancers and create the illusion of movement even when they\u2019re not doing much of it. These are conversations Mr. Zangardi and Ms. Haenn like to have.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a red carpet, you\u2019re just doing this,\u201d Ms. Haenn said, strutting two steps and squatting primly. \u201cWith what we do, we need to make sure you\u2019re not going to get stabbed with a huge safety pin while you\u2019re running around on stage.\u201d",

A new study shows that not only did fewer new ventures launch, but those that did were concentrated in major cities, rather than in small towns and rural communities.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014 there was a net of 166,500 new businesses in the U.S., half of which were generated in metropolitan areas like Silicon Valley, Houston, Miami and New York City, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s County Business Patterns program analyzed by the bipartisan Economic Innovation Group.\n\nThat\u2019s only about a 2.3% uptick in net new business growth, much lower than the new businesses opened following the last two financial recessions. In fact, nearly three out of five counties analyzed actually reported more businesses open than closed between 2010 and 2014.\n\nCompare that with the 1990s recovery, which recorded a 6.7% net increase in new businesses, while the 2000s recovery following the dot-com bubble saw a similar increase of 5.6%.\n\nBut not only was the rise in new business generation during this recovery smaller, the concentration of growth in major cities is unusual. During the 1990s recovery, 125 counties were responsible for half of the net total new business establishments in the country.

But she\u2019s not worried about buying diapers.\n\nWelcome plans to deliver her baby at a community hospital instead of a higher-priced Boston teaching hospital. The decision is expected to save thousands of dollars for her employer, which pays most of her health insurance costs. As a reward, the company has promised to buy two years\u2019 worth of diapers and wipes.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it influenced my decision,\u201d said Welcome, 25, who also has a toddler daughter. \u201cThe free diapers is an amazing incentive.\u201d\n\nState data show that the price of maternity care and other medical services can vary by many thousands of dollars from one hospital to another, and that price differences are not tied to quality. A commission has been assembled to study the issue. But some employers are seeking to exploit the price discrepancies, offering cash and other incentives, such as free diapers, to encourage workers to choose lower-cost health care services and providers.\n\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox:\n\nThe Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.\n\nWhen employees choose less expensive options for common services such as lab tests, colonoscopies, MRIs, physical therapy, and maternity care, their employers and health insurers can save hundreds or thousands of dollars per service. Employees may be able to save on their share of medical costs, as well, while pocketing sometimes lucrative rewards.\n\nOver time, if enough people shop around, the lower-cost claims can put a dent in rising health care premiums, employers said.\n\nOver the past few years, many insurers and employers have launched websites that estimate the costs at different providers, to allow consumers to shop around. (Massachusetts insurers are required to put this information online). But the sites are rarely used.\n\nEmployers are realizing they need to provide tangible rewards, said Patty Houpt, executive director of the New England Employee Benefits Council. \u201cIf you provide them with a financial incentive, all of a sudden they will be using that website,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to shop around unless you pay them to do it.\u201d\n\nHoupt and others said that such rewards (carrots) can be more successful than just moving employees into high-deductible or tiered health plans that force them to pay more out of pocket for expensive hospitals (sticks).\n\nWelcome works in customer service at Phia Group, a Braintree consulting firm that helps employers reduce health care costs, often testing new ideas in-house first. CEO Adam V. Russo offered the diaper perk last year to encourage employees to consider lower-cost hospitals.\n\nAt Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort, a ski resort in Hancock, executives are giving $100 to employees who choose lower-cost settings for routine tests, and even some surgeries, such as cataract and tonsil procedures.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, they get $100 back because they\u2019re saving the company money,\u201d resort owner Brian Fairbank said. \u201cAn MRI is an MRI, whether you get it done at the hospital or an imaging center,\u201d he said, though hospitals tend to charge more.\n\nCash rewards work best for employers that carry the insurance risk for their employees and pay claims and set premiums themselves (as opposed to employers that use insurance companies for those tasks). Businesses with cost-saving incentives say they have to spend many hours educating employees about the complexities of health care pricing, so employees are comfortable enough to shop around for care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking them to do something they\u2019ve never done before,\u201d said Rob Graybill, a vice president at Vitals, a New Jersey company that makes Web tools to help consumers shop for care. \u201cThis is a behavior change.\u201d\n\nVitals\u2019s SmartShopper program compiles a list of facilities for routine services. When they pick cost-efficient facilities, patients earn rewards ranging from $25 to $500. For a lab test, total savings could be a couple hundred dollars. For surgery, it could be well over $10,000.\n\nThe savings have added up at organizations like HealthTrust, a Concord, N.H., benefits provider for 47,000 public employees. HealthTrust said it saved almost $1.7 million in the first nine months of this year, even after paying employees $218,000 in rewards.\n\nMany experts say the ability of consumers to shop for some care is important for bringing health care costs under control. If enough people switch to lower-cost providers, the thinking goes, it will reduce spending and put pressure on expensive facilities to lower prices.\n\nBut some worry that price shopping makes it more difficult to coordinate a patient\u2019s care and could disrupt relationships between patients and their doctors.\n\nFor some, the rewards can be significant. Mary Burkhalter, a paralegal at Phia Group who works from home in Louisiana, considered two facilities for weight loss surgery. Though the same doctor would be performing the procedure, the price difference was a hefty $18,000.\n\nBurkhalter, 53, took advantage of another unusual employer perk. When she uses medical facilities that save the company money, she gets a check for up to 20 percent of the savings. She and her husband both had the gastric sleeve procedure. They have been losing weight and feeling healthier \u2014 and they got a reward, after taxes, of $4,300. It comes at a good time: They are preparing for some home renovations and plan to send their son to college next year.",

The $46m price includes a premium. The buyer wasn't disclosed. In 2006, the same auction house sold Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties for more than $15m, then a record. Another Rockwell painting, The Gossips, sold Wednesday for just under $8.5m, while a third, Walking to Church, fetched a little more than $3.2m.\n\nFor nearly two decades, all three had been on loan at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which has the world's largest collection of original Rockwell art, and is located in the artist's hometown.\n\nRockwell was paid $3,500 for Saying Grace. It appeared on the cover of the magazine's Thanksgiving issue in 1951 and was voted Post readers' favorite cover in a 1955 poll. The idea for the illustration came from a reader who saw a Mennonite family praying in a restaurant. Rockwell's son, Jarvis, was among the models the artist used for the drawing.\n\nThe illustrator, who created his first cover for the Post in 1916, is celebrated for his reflections of small town America and portraits of famous figures. Rockwell spent 47 years at the magazine and produced 321 covers.

Since peaking at US$190 in 2011, iron ore prices have slid more than 70 per cent to about US$50 a ton. This is denting tax revenues, forcing smaller mining companies to close and lay off thousands of employees.\n\n\"Western Australia was the big beneficiary of the China boom,\" says Chris Richardson, economist at Deloitte Access Economics. \"But it is suffering now as the mine construction phase ends and commodity prices fall amid a surge in iron ore supply and faltering demand.\"\n\nRead MoreCiti analysts call the 'end of the Iron Age'\n\nIn 2013 the state lost its triple-A credit rating. On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's warned it may face a further downgrade because of its budget problems.\n\nWestern Australia says that if iron ore prices stay at US$50 per ton it would wipe out A$4 billion (US$3 billion) in projected royalty revenues in 2015-16 \u2014 12 per cent of the state budget.\n\nUnemployment in the state, although still modest at 5.8 per cent, has risen from 3.8 per cent when iron ore prices peaked. House prices have started to fall in the state capital Perth, while they continue to grow in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nMr Barnett wants other states to give Western Australia a greater share of revenues from a nationwide goods and services tax. But so far Canberra and other states have rejected his pleas. On Friday, state premiers will discuss the dispute.\n\nWeak Chinese data are fueling concerns that Western Australia's problems could spread across a country that has avoided recession for two decades by riding China's commodities boom.\n\nMore from The Financial Times:\n\nBernanke chooses hedge fund for first post-Fed job Bund yields hit low as Greek debt plunges Christine Lagarde dashes Greek hopes on loan respite\n\nIron ore is Australia's biggest export, worth A$74 billion in 2013-14, and the plunge in prices is beginning to hurt the federal budget. In December, Canberra revised its budget deficit forecast to A$40 billion, or 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014-15, up from a forecast of A$29.8 billion made in May, citing the impact of a fall in iron ore prices to US$60 per ton.\n\nSince then, prices have continued to fall further and this week Joe Hockey, Australia's treasurer, warned they could fall as low as US$35, costing the exchequer a further A$6.35 billion a year in lost revenues.\n\n\"If iron ore prices stay at about US$45 and export volumes remain at current levels, then Australia should be OK,\" says Warren Hogan, ANZ chief economist. \"But it is a finely balanced situation and if we see the iron ore price drop lower and Chinese demand fall it could spell trouble.\"\n\nThe Liberal-National coalition's second budget next month will be a critical moment. Last year Mr Hockey flagged deep cuts to spending in an attempt to return the budget to surplus. Many of these reforms remain blocked in the Senate. Similar tough medicine this year could undermine confidence at a time when the Reserve Bank of Australia is trying to encourage business investment to diversify the country's resource-dependent economy.\n\n\"There is a need to get businesses to invest and take advantage of opportunities as China transitions to becoming a consumer-led economy,\" says Mr Hogan. \"Agriculture, tourism and education are key sectors.\"\n\nA weakening Australian dollar and a loosening of visa rules are boosting inbound tourism. In the year to the end of September, 789,000 Chinese tourists visited Australia, up 10 per cent on a year earlier. Chinese tourists are now second in number only to New Zealanders \u2014 and they spend the most at A$5.4 billion a year.\n\nWhether these alternative industries can cushion Australia from the collapse in commodity prices remains to be seen.\n\n\"China won't be throwing money at Australia any more,\" says Deloitte's Mr Richardson. \"And there is a real question mark over whether the country is prepared to undertake the reforms needed to transition its economy.\"",

Turnbull was also one of the first artists to embrace American abstract expressionism, creating lasting relationships with Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.\n\nHe exhibited extensively over the last 60 years, while the Chatsworth House Trust is to present a major exhibition of his work next year.\n\nThe director of the Tate, Nicholas Serota, said: \"William Turnbull was an exceptional artist, unusually gifted both as a painter and a sculptor. Initially, his distinctive sculpture developed in response to his stay as a young man in postwar Paris, where he met Giacometti, Brancusi and Helion among many others.\"\n\n\"It matured through his admiration for the simple forms of ancient and eastern cultures and his abiding search for the essence in any object. In this he came close to the purity of Barnett Newman, or to his own contemporaries such as Ellsworth Kelly. However, his sculpture and painting always had a humanist sensibility that identified it as profoundly European.\"\n\nTurnbull, who died on Thursday, was the subject last year of a documentary called Beyond Time: William Turnbull, which was released by one of his sons, Alex. Narrated by the actor Jude Law, it re-evaluated the legacy of an often secretive artist who never quite became a household name.\n\nAs well as Alex, Turnbull is also survived by another son, Johnny.

        "text": "There are not many living artists whose every new work you would always want to see, but Tacita Dean is high on that list. At 45, she is the great poet of art film. Over the years, she has turned her deep and elegiac vision to some of the grandest of dramas \u2013 storms, shipwrecks, total solar eclipse \u2013 and some of the smallest, from the passage of diurnal light through a restaurant to the faint breeze that transforms a lake from still landscape to moving picture. Not for nothing has she been variously compared to Terence Davies, Walt Whitman and Edward Hopper.\n\nLately, though, Dean has turned more to the art of the portrait. It suits her origins as a painter. And she has found a way of transforming the single, condensed image that a painter might make over many sittings and long scrutiny by spooling time through a sequence of nearly motionless images.\n\nHer studies of the Italian sculptor Mario Merz and the poet (and translator of WG Sebald) Michael Hamburger are classics of empathetically patient observation. In each, she finds elements of the man in oblique or ephemeral details. The overgrown house, the volatile wind and the sudden arrival of a rainbow, in Hamburger's case, brought this complex man into clearer view.\n\nNow Dean has made an immensely beautiful portrait of one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, the American choreographer Merce Cunningham. It is a perfect collaboration between two kinds of creator. But so strong is the affinity between them that one soon begins to see that they are intent upon the same thing: man's brief walk (or dance) in the sun.\n\nCraneway Event was filmed on 16mm in late 2008, as Cunningham rehearses his dancers in the disused Ford assembly plant on the east shore of San Francisco Bay. Craneway refers to the purpose of this grand canyon of a building, with its full-length windows and vast doors opening on to the quay outside. Event is Cunningham's term for a 100-minute anthology of pieces from the company's repertoire. And this is what Dean appears to give you at first: almost two hours of the master at work, the dancers practising against a backdrop of passing ships and the distant hilltops of Marin County.\n\nBut everything runs against expectation. The film opens with a pelican on the quay steadfastly waiting for the best moment to lift into flight. Inside, technicians are laboriously peeling gaffer tape from the floor. The dancers are pacing round the hall, a parade of earthbound figures apparently whiling away time. Cunningham's quiet arrival, a black-clad figure in a wheelchair, scarcely alters the picture.\n\nAnyone familiar with Dean's work will know that the rehearsal itself is not likely to be the main event. Rather, she notices the totality of the scene: the grids of the windows like hundreds of picture frames on the landscape beyond, the cavernous space, the liquid sheen of the floor with its ever-changing reflections. Her cameras drink in the sunshine. Occasionally, a dancer slides into shot, or a ship glides past, but it gradually becomes apparent that these are Cunningham's preoccupations, too, precisely what inspire the wonderful abstractions of his choreography.\n\nThe dancers move like creatures and objects as much as people. One may be executing a slow circle with his toe, bent arms rotating like propellers, head delicately craned like a bird. Another raises an elegant arm, describing the sail of a yacht. Four together take on the rhythms of an assembly line smoothly alternating with a square dance. A pas de deux becomes an aerial gantry.\n\nAll of this occurs without music. The only sounds are of creak, footfall and soft-shoe shuffle, occasionally broken by Cunningham's mellifluous voice, suggesting a slightly different orientation in space. He appears to view the dance like a painter, holding his pen like a brush, yet he is also within it. The movements all seem to flow through and from him.\n\nDean shows him at a distance, framed by his dancers, or watchfully close, the tendrils of his hair illuminated like a Rembrandt etching. Approaching 90, he still looks forever young and graceful, presiding over the scene like a pensive angel. In one shot, the handles of his chair at shoulder height appear ever so briefly like wings.\n\nA pigeon arrives, appearing to swim in the reflective floor. A man in a stetson ambles along the boardwalk. A great ship passes with such magnificent grace that one can hardly help but think of Cunningham himself, wheeling slowly out of the frame. He died during the editing process; the film becomes both portrait and homage.\n\nCunningham watches and guides with transcendent concentration; so does Dean, whose camera positions are never as anticipated. Both orchestrate movement in mysterious ways. And like Cunningham, Dean is fascinated by the structure of motion and time; her film is, in a sense, open-ended.\n\nThe long day closes, another begins. Light passes through the celluloid as shiftingly as the sun through the high windows. And eventually the viewer, having nearly rebelled at the slowness of both artists' pace, becomes entranced \u2013 calm and poised as the figures on screen, mesmerised by their movements through glowing space.\n\nDean's work is screened too infrequently in this country. Tate Britain owns many of her best films, including Disappearance at Sea and Michael Hamburger, but they are not on permanent display. Occasionally, you catch a work in a mixed show, but it is almost 10 years since her last major exhibition and 12 since she was shortlisted for the Turner prize.\n\nI have no idea why she has never won the prize, since she is one of the most intelligent, profound and inventive artists of her generation. This film (and her enthralling study of nuns in a Cork convent, grace incarnate, shown at the Edinburgh festival last August) could have put her on this year's very strong list. Still, as Cunningham says in his serenely encouraging way, there is always time again tomorrow.",

        "text": "Nearly a year after Partners HealthCare was forced to give up its bid to acquire South Shore Hospital in Weymouth , the state\u2019s largest health care system has yet to decide whether to forge ahead with a second stalled acquisition that could throw it into another intense debate over its size, market power, and impact on rising health care costs.\n\nHallmark Health System, which owns community hospitals in Medford and Melrose, has been in limbo ever since the deal was put on hold early this year, losing money, waiting to finance needed upgrades, and unable to discuss a potential merger with anyone else. Ultimately, local officials say, the long-term survival of the Hallmark hospitals depends on linking up with a bigger, richer health care system.\n\nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce\n\nPartners HealthCare chief executive David Torchiana on the potential acquisition with Hallmark Health System: \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a bright future for the hospital in the long run if they don\u2019t partner with someone that can make them sustainable,\u201d Melrose Mayor Robert J. Dolan said.\n\nPartners and Hallmark officials have in recent weeks explored whether a deal is still possible. Last month, Dr. David Torchiana, chief executive of Partners, and Alan Macdonald, CEO of Hallmark, met with the state\u2019s Health Policy Commission, which reviews proposed mergers and their impact on health care costs.\n\nColeen Elstermeyer, the commission\u2019s chief of staff, said Partners executives requested the meeting but did not give any indication about whether they would move ahead with the Hallmark acquisition. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure that out,\u201d Torchiana said in a brief interview Thursday.\n\nA Hallmark spokesman declined to comment.\n\nLast year, the Health Policy Commission voiced concern that Partners\u2019 acquisition of Hallmark would add to Partners\u2019 market power, increase health care spending as much as $23 million a year, and lead to higher premiums for employers and consumers. The commission declined to comment on how it would respond if Partners pursued the deal again.\n\nBut there is little reason to believe the commission would respond differently if Partners and Hallmark presented the same deal, Torchiana acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019d guess we\u2019d have to come up with something that would be significantly different, in all probability,\u201d he said.\n\nPartners, whose network includes 10 hospitals and 6,000 doctors, and Hallmark, which owns Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital in Melrose, have been in talks for at least three years. Their proposal to merge followed Partners\u2019 earlier and more controversial agreement to acquire South Shore Hospital, which already dominated the market south of Boston.\n\nThe two mergers became part of a settlement negotiated by former attorney general Martha Coakley, which allowed the deals to go through in exchange for other concessions, such as price caps. But the settlement was opposed by consumer advocates, antitrust experts, a coalition of Partners competitors, and eventually Coakley\u2019s successor, Attorney General Maura Healey, who took office in January.\n\nThe same month, a judge rejected the settlement, finding that the acquisitions by Partners, one of the state\u2019s most expensive providers, would increase health care costs for consumers. In February, Partners abandoned the South Shore merger, while putting the acquisition of Hallmark on hold.\n\nHealey\u2019s office would not comment on how she would respond if Partners moved ahead with the Hallmark acquisition.\n\nDavid Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington who opposed Partners\u2019 expansion plans, said market power in a Hallmark acquisition would be less of an issue than it was in the proposed South Shore Hospital deal. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201call you have to do is look at the Health Policy Commission\u2019s report and you see there still are concerns there.\u201d\n\nLeaders of Hallmark, which lost $5.8 million on operations last year, have argued that they would not be able to upgrade aging hospital buildings, technology systems, or medical services without the cash and support a new parent company like Partners would provide. Executives of both health systems have said a merger, by putting many different medical services under one organization, would allow for more coordinated care for residents of the North Shore.\n\nThe Hallmark deal was part of a broader plan at Partners to consolidate and reorganize its network in the North Shore. As part of that plan, Partners has moved to close its community hospital in Lynn and expand services at its hospital in Salem, which jointly make up North Shore Medical Center.\n\nAt Hallmark, Partners planned to convert Lawrence Memorial Hospital from an acute-care facility with 134 beds to a smaller short-stay hospital with 20 to 40 beds, while renovating the 234-bed Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.\n\n\u201cPartners had a vision of a combined health care system north of Boston,\u201d said Ruselle W. Robinson, a health care lawyer at Posternak Blankstein & Lund LLP in Boston. \u201cThey have to figure out if that still makes sense. They may want it to look different now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Robinson noted, Hallmark appears to be just waiting. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really done anything. It appears they haven\u2019t looked for another suitor,\u201d he said.\n\nHallmark doctors are part of Partners\u2019 physicians network and many local officials and residents see a takeover by Partners, which generated $11 billion in revenues last year, as the best way to save two struggling community hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe life of our local hospital is much stronger with a merger,\u201d Medford Mayor Michael J. McGlynn said, \u201cand if you have the opportunity to merge with the king, then you should do it.\u201d",

        "text": "House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo vowed Wednesday to put new limits on contracts that restrict employees from working for competitors, breathing new life into a long-running reform campaign that has divided the Massachusetts high-tech sector.\n\nIn a speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, DeLeo said noncompete agreements should be limited to one year. He said the contracts should not apply to lower-wage workers, such as sandwich-shop employees.\n\nWorkers also should be clearly informed that a noncompete agreement is required before taking a job, DeLeo said.\n\n\u201cOur goal will be to protect businesses here and improve Massachusetts\u2019 reputation as the premier incubator for talent,\u201d DeLeo said.\n\nHis support for compromise legislation on noncompete agreements was welcomed by major employers, including EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, which has been a longtime supporter and enforcer of noncompete contracts.\n\nThe state House speaker made the promise for the first time during a speech Wednesday morning at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBut the details of DeLeo\u2019s proposal irked some in the state\u2019s startup sector, who said having any restrictions that prevent workers from taking new jobs makes Massachusetts less competitive with a state like California, where noncompete agreements are largely banned.\n\nThe timing of the bill\u2019s release was unclear, although state lawmakers have only until the end of July before formal sessions end for the year. A spokesman for Senate President Stanley Rosenberg said he isn\u2019t going to comment until he sees the specifics of DeLeo\u2019s proposal, but noted that Rosenberg supported noncompete reforms in 2014.\n\nNoncompete agreements give companies the ability to sue a former employee who takes a similar position in the same industry. Supporters of the agreements say they are an effective way of preventing workers from leaving with valuable trade secrets.\n\nOpponents argue that such agreements stifle innovation by handcuffing people to their jobs, preventing bright employees from launching their own startups or joining fast-growing rivals.\n\nNoncompete agreements typically range from one to two years in Massachusetts, although some are longer, said Christopher H. Lindstrom, a lawyer at Nutter McClennen & Fish. Judges can decide to amend a noncompete agreement, but two-year agreements aren\u2019t usually seen as overly burdensome, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that limiting it to 12 months would have a significant impact on a lot of employers out there,\u201d Lindstrom said.\n\nVenture investors and technology entrepreneurs have made noncompete reform a central part of their public policy lobbying during the past few years. Those efforts gained traction on Beacon Hill in 2014, when the Senate approved a bill that would have made it tougher to enforce noncompete contracts that last longer than six months and prohibited their use for hourly workers.\n\nOne story that particularly resonated with lawmakers came from a college student from Wellesley who told them she had lost her summer job at a camp when management realized she had a noncompete agreement in effect with a nearby camp.\n\nDeLeo and other House leaders declined to go along with the Senate at the time.\n\n\u201cHaving him support reform really feels like progress,\u201d said Jody Rose, executive director of the New England Venture Capital Association.\n\nEMC\u2019s support is also significant. The company has previously opposed efforts to change noncompete laws, but EMC\u2019s general counsel, Paul Dacier, said Wednesday that DeLeo\u2019s proposal \u201cprotects legitimate business interests while ensuring continued growth of our state\u2019s innovation economy.\u201d\n\nDeLeo and his staff worked closely with business leaders, including the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, during the past year to fashion a compromise bill. The involvement of the partnership, which consists of some of the most powerful CEOs in the state, started about a year ago, president Daniel O\u2019Connell said. \u201cThe group felt they could provide some constructive input about a compromise on the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nEMC\u2019s chief executive, Joe Tucci, is among the partnership\u2019s members, but O\u2019Connell declined to disclose the specific stance of any individual members. He said his group reached a consensus on the issue, and that the consensus is reflected in the reforms suggested by DeLeo on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe speaker did not address all of our recommendations, but we felt he hit all the important points,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cTwelve months seemed like a reasonable compromise to protect the intellectual property of employers and also allow employees to plot their own career paths.\u201d\n\nAssociated Industries of Massachusetts, another business group, had been one of the most vocal supporters of noncompetes. But spokesman Chris Geehern said DeLeo\u2019s proposal appears to be a reasonable compromise. He said DeLeo consulted with AIM several times before Wednesday\u2019s speech.\n\nDemocratic Representative Lori Ehrlich of Marblehead has aggressively pursued bills to eliminate or restrict noncompetes for years. She said she would prefer a ban on them, but sees DeLeo\u2019s approach as a big step forward in the debate.\n\nSome notable members of the state\u2019s tech sector, however, panned DeLeo\u2019s plan as too limited.\n\nTravel-tech veteran Paul English noted that he had to wait 18 months to start his newest company, Lola, to avoid a lawsuit under his noncompete agreement with a previous employer, Priceline Group. Restricting noncompete agreements to one year, he said, would still seriously limit entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cI frankly think it\u2019s just so weak that it almost has no impact,\u201d English said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019d be kind of like the new mayor of Flint, Mich., saying \u2018Let\u2019s just clean up half the water. We\u2019re still going to make kids sick, but they\u2019ll be a little bit less sick.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd Bijan Sabet, an investor with the Boston venture firm Spark Capital, said, \u201cWhy do employees in our state have less rights than employees in California?\u201d\n\nJeff Bussgang, a general partner at another Boston venture firm, Flybridge Capital Partners, sees DeLeo\u2019s stance as a positive development, but acknowledged that progress has been slow, especially for startups that are used to the fast pace of the innovation sector.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on noncompete reform for like five years,\u201d Bussgang said. \u201cAs an entrepreneur, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.

His grandparents moved to the US, got married and settled there \u2013 and after the first world war returned to the UK.\n\nMany have also been interested in Chris Miller's tale of how he ended up with this close up shot of the late Lady Di at Tidworth in Wiltshire, looking straight down the barrel of the lens in what he calls one of the first times she became visibly upset by the press onslaught.\n\nNot only did readers tell us about their particular memories related to people in the pictures \u2013 but also about their fondness for the Kodak technology and techniques used to capture, and record the image.\n\nOn our Kodak thread on Flickr, where readers are continuing to share their images, there is much discussion on the methods used and the result \u2013 and our pictures editor Roger Tooth aptly describes the fondness for the Kodak products in this comment piece:\n\n\"That was the thing about shooting on film and printing on paper: every time, it felt fresh. Fresh film, chilled from a fridge. Box fresh, beautifully packaged by Kodak in cute yellow boxes that opened with one thumb, perforated in exactly the right place.\"\n\nOne Kodak product which has been fondly recalled by the youth of the 90s is the disposable hand-held camera. Found at wedding parties, taken on many a travel trip or bought off the cuff to document the events of a sunny day \u2013 the disposable camera was the common companion for those on fun and spontaneous escapades.\n\nAlex Kovalenko tells us about a project he's involved with using Kodak disposable cameras called Disposable stories. The camera is given to someone with the direction to take five photos and pass it on. This chain carries on five times until it's returned to Alex and his team \u2013 who process the photos and add them to the project website here.\n\nThe photos from cameras which went round the world in September and June 2011 have just been uploaded and you cannot help but be sapped into the camera's own story \u2013 tracking a journey around the earth in the hands of excited travellers with their own vision of the world and stories to tell from the trip. Alex says:\n\n\"I hope people will continue travelling with those and not only with cameraphones. Such an amazing feeling when you get your photos back from the shop after your trip and don't even really remember which photos you took.\"\n\nGoing back even further in the Kodak production line, Neil Brown on Flickr has shared with us his project of uploading Kodak 35mm slides to the web to make a digital copy. Neil started collecting the slides he found at boot fairs, jumble sales, secondhand shops and auctions, as part of an art project. He writes:\n\n\"This is such a shame, I just love the physical element you get with 35mm slides, which is lost with digital.\"\n\nTake a look at the wall of slides on Neil's website here \u2013 each has a story and memory which feel somewhat lost and forgotten.\n\nBut reader Mark Davies, from Cheltenham, runs a project reuniting lost photographs with the families to whom they originally belonged. Lifebooth, he says, started with a Kodak folder he found at a flea market in Oxford \u2013 this sparked an interest in lost family albums and he soon found many people were selling them on eBay.\n\n\"I thought it was really sad those family artefacts of our memory were ending up being sold and I was interested in the stories behind the albums.\"\n\nMark thinks the lady connected to the images has since passed away, but continues to laboriously look for clues which appear to track one holiday for a boy called Jimmy who in 1949 is photographed next to his father's grave. He's currently looking for a woman called Nancy pictured in this photo:\n\nYou can read more about it on his blog here. He writes:\n\n\"I made a promise to myself that day when I was semi-resigned to being unable to find them, that if I ever saw photo albums for sale, and if there was any kind of information in them that would help me connect them to a family (even just a surname or a place), then I would try to reunite the photographs with someone who had a personal connection with the people in the photos.\"\n\nThis all eventually led to Mark doing a PhD in family photography and he continues to reunite lost family albums with their owners or relatives here.\n\nBut it all started with the Kodak folder \u2013 his \"Kodak moment\".\n\nThere are other similar projects around trying to unearth the stories behind the photographs. And these remind me of one I was familiar with in Cardiff after a pile of photographs was found during a refurbishment of an old music hall \u2013 sparking memories of 1980s Cardiff life and calling for residents to come forward with stories and information on the pictures. The project was called Cardiff Before Cardiff and is run by Jon Pountney.\n\nDo you know of any photographic projects unearthing the stories behind the picture? Let us know in comments. You can see the \"Kodak moments\" gallery here and find out more about getting involved here.",

Last week, officials said they plan to start removing the dilapidated bridge in March after the Coast Guard raised concerns that it might tumble into the Fort Point Channel.\n\nThe Walsh administration will begin a formal public process this spring to decide whether to rehab the bridge or build a new one. The city has to do something after committing up to $100 million to replace the link as part of its agreement to woo General Electric Co.\u2019s world headquarters to Boston.\n\nLynch is a former ironworker who built bridges and has been keeping tabs on the Northern Avenue structure because it\u2019s in his district. He isn\u2019t shy about what the city should do. He thinks it\u2019s time to retire a relic. This is not the moment to rebuild a steel swing bridge, a move preferred by some preservationists.\n\n\u201cNo, not at this point,\u201d the South Boston Democrat said. \u201cWe should look at maximum utility.\u201d\n\nTucked in the agreement to bring GE to Boston is a commitment from the city to spend as much as $100 million to reopen the Old Northern Avenue Bridge.\n\nLynch said that means the city should build a new fixed bridge \u2014 one that does not have to open when boats pass underneath like the old span did. He also thinks that\u2019s what the Coast Guard would prefer. Swing bridges are old technology, and not too many folks are building them these days.\n\nLynch says he has secured funds for the bridge work.\n\nLynch also wants the bridge to once again carry cars so the fast-growing Seaport District has another outlet for traffic. He said he recently had lunch with federal judges at the Moakley courthouse who raised concerns about gridlock during high-profile trials and its effect on security and public safety.\n\nThe congressman himself recently experienced the congestion when he it took him 40 minutes to get from his district office at the other end of the Southie waterfront to City Hall.\n\n\u201cI could have walked it,\u201d he said.\n\nLynch wouldn\u2019t be the first congressman from South Boston for whom the Northern Avenue Bridge holds no sentimental value. The late Joe Moakley \u2014 whose seat Lynch filled after his death in 2001 \u2014 famously was not a fan. At one of Southie\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day breakfasts, Moakley brought along a box that contained proposals for the span \u2014 and then proceeded to pull out some dynamite, according to an Associated Press account.\n\nThe oft-told story goes that Moakley did not like the bridge because it blocked views of the Evelyn Moakley Bridge \u2014 named in honor of his wife. That span, built in 1996, connects the Financial District with the Seaport District and was meant to replace its Northern Avenue counterpart.\n\nThe Northern Avenue Bridge hasn\u2019t been structurally sound to carry cars since 1997, and then pedestrians lost access in December 2014 when city engineers had to abruptly shut down the structure because it could not bear any weight.\n\nMike Capuano is one local congressman who does not have an opinion on whether the bridge should be rehabbed. Capuano sits on the transportation committee and told me he\u2019ll go to bat for the city whatever it decides.\n\n\u201cThe $9 million, it\u2019s a wonderful earmark,\u201d he said, but \u201cit\u2019s not going to build a bridge.\u201d\n\nThe Somerville Democrat would like to see cars on the bridge, though he points out that it is unlikely to significantly reduce traffic given the configuration of roads in the area. Capuano would like to see the span remain pedestrian-friendly.\n\nThe city is still figuring out how it will pay for the project. It has tapped a tiny portion of the federal funding Lynch has secured and plans to use the rest. As soon as next month, the city will put out a request to the public to gather ideas on how to rebuild the bridge, followed by a public design process.\n\nChris Osgood, who oversees the city\u2019s departments of transportation and public works, said officials are looking for ideas that will improve access, have a sense of history, and create a space that connects the harbor, the channel, and the Greenway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how to balance those goals,\u201d Osgood said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a lot of steps to make sure preservation is a priority.\u201d\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure. Much to the ire of preservationists, the bridge needs to come down soon because it\u2019s in such poor condition.\n\nEven iron and steel doesn\u2019t stand forever.",

Although it would be impossible to pick who to be besties with: President Laura Roslin, Captain Kara \u201cStarbuck\u201d Thrace, or Boomer. I\u2019m sure I could contribute with either leading the new civilization, finding the new civilization, blowing up the Cylons, or marrying a Cylon. The show played out exquisitely and tied up every story line. The characters struggled with the balance of justice and safety, old vs. new technology, all of which certainly resonates today.

Their stories call out for the standard stereotype of the genius who must endure hardship and inner turmoil to create art. The challenge comes when a filmmaker tries to fit a life that is as variegated as a jazz solo into that template.\n\nWhen Baker died in 1988 at a well-worn 58, he left behind a messy mythic legacy, enough for many movies (Bruce Weber\u2019s 1988 doc \u201cLet\u2019s Get Lost\u201d is a good start). Budreau focuses on key events in the 1960s (with flashbacks in sleek black and white that would make great album covers) and pretty much makes up the rest.\n\nAt first the results seem both convoluted and one-note, an improvisation that goes nowhere. But when Hawke\u2019s Baker finally slips out of the whiney loser persona and performs \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d the scene evokes Baker\u2019s elusive melancholy and wistful torment, making the earlier fumblings worth the struggle.\n\n\u201cIt came too easy to him,\u201d laments Baker\u2019s long-suffering manager Dick Bock (Callum Keith Rennie). By 1966 the easy times are long gone, and Baker lies strung out on heroin in an Italian jail cell staring at his trumpet on the slimy floor. A tarantula crawls out of it. Then, who should walk in but Dino De Laurentiis, offering to make a biopic of Baker\u2019s life?\n\nThis never happened, and at this point \u201cBlue\u201d threatens to become a meta-movie as the made-up movie within-the-movie merges with the real movie\u2019s real-life flashbacks. Luckily, a drug dealer fed up with Baker\u2019s debt knocks his teeth out. His career seemingly at its end, Baker falls in love with Jane (a great Carmen Ejogo), the actress who plays his real wife in the movie-within-the-movie, and the story slips into a jazz take on the comeback theme.\n\nFor the next two decades, the end notes reveal, Baker made the best music of his career. The film does its job if it encourages people to give that music a listen.\n\nWritten and directed by Robert Budreau. Starring Ethan Hawke, Carmen Ejogo, Callum Keith Rennie.

        "text": "Early Wednesday morning the Apple Store was taken offline for maintenance. Often such measures usually indicate a new product is on the horizon. After a few hours of anticipation, the store came back to life, featuring a new version of the iPod Touch.\n\nThe new product is the first substantial change to the iPod line in three years. Gone are the days when an iPod release was enough to headline an Apple AAPL keynote speech; these days a website refresh and press release seem to be sufficient.\n\nThe new iPod Touch features the same processor found in the iPhone 6, an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera, and an improved front-facing camera built for \u201ceven better selfies\u201d (Apple\u2019s words, not mine). The device\u2019s screen size remains unchanged, measuring 4-inches. The device\u2019s faster processor is accompanied by Apple\u2019s M8 coprocessor, a chip built specifically to count steps and track motion. Additionally, Apple Music will be available on all devices, complete with the standard three-month trial.\n\nMatching the basic color lineup of the iPhone and iPad, the new iPod touch is available in gold, space gray, and silver, in addition to bright blue and pink.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the iPod Touch is a smaller version of the iPhone, just without the cellular connection. So why does Apple even bother making them then? Hint: Think small. The iPod Touch, in all its glory, is aimed at kids.\n\nThe iPod Touch is less expensive than an iPad and doesn\u2019t require stiff monthly fees associated with an iPhone cellular plan. At $199 for a 16 gigabyte model, parents are more likely to purchase one as a birthday or Christmas present than the bulkier and more expensive iPad. Although, it\u2019s important to note, the iPod Touch can get a tad pricey should consumers spring for the advanced 128 gigabyte model, currently priced at $399.\n\nApple\u2019s decision to keep the iPod screen to a meager 4-inches at first seems to go against the success spurred by the 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus respectively. However, the 4-inch screen just so happens to fit perfectly in a young persons hand; a detail Apple undoubtedly took into consideration.\n\nIn essence, the iPod touch is nothing more than a gateway drug for the next generation. It\u2019s a drug designed to lure kids into Apple\u2019s ever-growing ecosystem with the promise of an experience that only improves as users graduate to the next device.\n\nWe\u2019ll never know just how successful the new iPod lineup is since Apple stopped reporting unit sells earlier this year. Nowadays the company lumps iPod sales into an \u201cOther Products\u201d category along with the Apple Watch, among other things.",

        "text": "Domestic and intimate partner violence (DV/IPV) is a \u201cfamily secret\u201d in our Black communities. While I\u2019m not suggesting that all Black people think and function in similar enough ways that we could all be labeled simply as one \u201ccommunity,\u201d I do know we have pervasive problems that require nuanced discourse \u2014 especially in light of the national conversation about domestic abuse that has erupted over the last week.\n\nSince Ray Rice, former Baltimore Ravens running back, was indefinitely suspended because a video was released of him punching his then-fianc\u00e9e Janay until she was unconscious, there have been many conversations about violence between partners, and about the particular vulnerability of Black female victims. Much of the discussion has centered around the level of empathy and compassion shown toward victims like Janay, who choose to remain with their abusers.\n\nThese events have forced the country to face difficult truths about how prevalent domestic and intimate partner violence (DV/IPV) is in America. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an estimated 1.3 million American women experience DV/IPV each year. Women make up 85% of the victims of DV/IPV. Despite this, most cases are never reported to the police and most women are victimized by people they know.\n\nAnd for Black women, it\u2019s an even bigger problem: Black women are almost three times as likely to experience death as a result of DV/IPV than White women. And while Black women only make up 8% of the population, 22% of homicides that result from DV/IPV happen to Black Women and 29% of all victimized women, making it one of the leading causes of death for Black women ages 15 to 35. Statistically, we experience sexual assault and DV/IPV at disproportionate rates and have the highest rates of intra-racial violence against us than any other group. We are also less likely to report or seek help when we are victimized.\n\nThe reasons Black women suffer disproportionately from abuse are complex. Racism and sexism are two of the biggest obstacles that Black women in America face. But because many Black women and men believe racism is a bigger issue than sexism, Black women tend to feel obligated to put racial issues ahead of sex-based issues. For Black women, a strong sense of cultural affinity and loyalty to community and race renders many of us silent, so our stories often go untold. One of the biggest related impediments is our hesitation in trusting the police or the justice system. As Black people, we don\u2019t always feel comfortable surrendering \u201cour own\u201d to the treatment of a racially biased police state and as women, we don\u2019t always feel safe calling police officers who may harm us instead of helping us. And when we do speak out or seek help, we too often experience backlash from members of our communities who believe we are airing out dirty laundry and making ourselves look bad in front of White people.\n\nAccess to employment and economic self-sufficiency are also important. Racism has a disparate impact on Black people, men especially, who have, for the past six decades, consistently been held to an unemployment rate almost double that of white men. In a society that measures \u201cmanhood\u201d primarily by one\u2019s ability to provide, being denied access to the means to provide can cause some men to seek power through dominating women. For some men, the venting of anger turns violent and their partners suffer the greatest blows. Black women also face employment disparities, earning less than Black men and White men and women. This wage disparity limits available options and leaves many women, particularly mothers, feeling trapped in bad relationships where financial needs trump all.\n\nSpiritual beliefs and negative views about mental health services also factor into why many Black women remain with abusive partners. One in three Black Americans who need mental health treatment actually receive it, and we are more likely to rely on religious guidance and faith-based practices when working through relationship issues. Religious beliefs often discourage divorce, encourage forgiveness and occasionally condemns those who seek psychiatric services instead of relying on faith. Black women\u2019s perceptions of what constitutes abuse have been influenced by their negotiation of spiritual and mental health beliefs and how they have shaped our paradigms. Researchers have also found that Black women report feeling more obligated to fight back than to report abuse and that is reflected in the disproportionate rates of DV/IPV reported by Black men. Our attempts to embody the \u201cstrong Black woman\u201d stereotype have often done more harm than good, to us and those we love.\n\nThere is a lot we don\u2019t fully understand about the unique ways in which Black women endure DV/IPV because the lack of empirical research is indicative of what may simply be lack of empathy and concern for what Black women experience. I have been a fierce advocate for Black women and a mental health social worker for more than a decade and I have learned that we cannot win this fight if we don\u2019t acknowledge any such fight exists to begin with. We need to continue speaking out and social media has become valuable in helping victims share their stories and learn about resources that can help. We need to push for stronger laws that punish criminal abusers and we need to advocate for more treatment options for victims and abusers who seek help. We need to fund advocacy programs and supportive services for victims of DV/IPV and work on reducing the stigma attached to seeking help when one is in trouble. Most of all, we need to believe that Black girls and women are valuable, important and worth putting ourselves and our personal safety first, and in our society that might be the hardest thing of all.\n\nFor too long, the experiences of Black women have been ignored, particularly when it comes to those that affect our overall health and well-being. For centuries, our bodies and labor have been exploited to serve the needs of everyone but ourselves, and the physical and psychological toll can no longer be swept under the rug. Black women matter and the longer we remain invisible and have our dignity stripped and our humanity disregarded, the closer we get to the destruction of our families and communities. We must all work to end the marginalization of Black women and focus our energies on amplifying our voices and sharing what we go through at home, at work and in our communities.",

According to the documents, businesses will only be able to send ads to users who are already conversing with them via the chat service, presumably a way to ensure that they are indeed interested in that business and its offerings.\n\nMessenger now has more than 800 million monthly active users, Messenger chief Dave Marcus revealed in January.\n\nAs a way to help businesses open those channels of communication (and advertising), the leaked documents reveal that Facebook FB has build a web URL short code custom to each business. When a user clicks or taps on the link, it opens a Messenger chat with that specific business. It\u2019s like a phone number, but for Messenger chats. Though Facebook isn\u2019t commenting on the short code, it is live at the moment, and it appears some businesses are already experimenting with it.\n\nThe fact that Facebook is requiring businesses to already have a conversation going with a user in order to send them an ads signals that the company is more than aware of how easily it could enrage its users. Messenger is already a fairly intimate communication tool (at least for a lot of people), and allowing businesses to spam users could be very damaging. This also means it could likely charge a lot for these ads given the highly targeted and direct context.\n\nNone of this is of course all that surprising. Facebook began to lay the groundwork almost a year ago when it announced at its annual developer conference in San Francisco that it would allow businesses to communicate with people and customers through Messenger. Since then, it\u2019s added features like a button on business pages that lets users send a message via Messenger to that business in order to facilitate those user-business communications.\n\nMessenger is also experimenting with \u201cchat bots,\u201d software programs that interact with users inside the messaging app similar to human conversations, which could help uses with shopping and booking services. Assist, for example, is one such bot available on Messenger, which touts itself as helping users handle everything from sending a flower delivery, to booking a hotel, and ordering an Uber or Lyft ride.\n\nA Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the advertising plans. It\u2019s also not clear whether it has similar plans for messaging app Whatsapp, which Facebook acquired for roughly $19 billion in early 2014, though Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said in the past that it\u2019s not a monetization strategy he believes is best suited to Whatsapp.",

        "text": "The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America\u2019s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat are some common mistakes young entrepreneurs make?\u201d is written by Karl Martin, founder and CTO of Nymi.\n\nWhen founding a new business, you have to accept that you might drop the ball sometimes. It\u2019s not about perfection, but rather about setting priorities and disciplining yourself to keep them. Do well at the things that will move the business forward, and for everything else, just don\u2019t make any fatal mistakes.\n\nHowever, this leads to a more macro-level challenge. As an entrepreneur, you\u2019re defining your business from the ground up. What business paths should you explore, and which are not worth your time? This has been a core challenge for me from the beginning. While my team and I have broadly applicable technology, we have to accept that we can\u2019t do everything. Having limited resources is the common variable that binds all startups.\n\nThe biggest mistake that I see many young entrepreneurs make is not clearly defining which opportunities they will target. This can be framed as a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat experiment for startups. In the classic thought experiment, physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger supposed that a cat could be simultaneously alive and dead if its fate was dependent on the unobserved state of a quantum system. As entrepreneurs, our number one driver is always achieving success for our ventures and keeping them alive. But a company\u2019s fate is dependent on an unknown: Which of the multitude of opportunities is the winning path? The decision is usually made with very limited information, leading to a highly uncertain outcome.\n\nSee also: This is why so many startups end up in financial trouble\n\nThe natural psychological response to this dilemma that many inexperienced entrepreneurs have is to simply not make a definitive choice \u2014 to run multiple options at the same time. But believing the cat is still alive somewhere in the flurry of activities is a fallacy. With limited resources, you risk running out of capital before achieving important proof points to keep the business alive.\n\nThe answer to this conundrum feels unnatural, but it involves making decisions quickly and resolutely with limited information. What\u2019s often not obvious is that if you move fast, you have greater opportunity to recover from mistakes and try another option should the first choice not pan out (also known as the classic startup \u201cpivot\u201d).\n\nIn the case of Nymi, we had originally positioned our wearable authentication product, the Nymi Band, as a consumer device. We pushed early with a pre-order campaign and got lots of invaluable market feedback. Before we even fully launched the product, the data showed us that the interest in our product was too broad across consumer applications and would be very hard to execute effectively. We decided to pivot and focus on enterprise use cases that allowed us to create a user experience centered around truly burning problems in the market.\n\nMany aspects of being an entrepreneur feel psychologically unnatural. Going fast and hard down a path with high uncertainty goes against our natural tendencies to mitigate risk. But avoiding failure simply leads to a slow death as your resources dry up. By making fast decisions and failing early, you realize that your cat may actually have a few lives to give.\n\nRead all responses to the Entrepreneur Insider question: What are some common mistakes young entrepreneurs make?\n\nThis is where most startups go wrong by Stephen Lake, CEO of Thalmic Labs.\n\nDoing these 3 things will destroy your startup by Michael Gasiorek, editor-in-chief of Startup Grind.\n\nThe avoidable mistake every entrepreneur makes by Andrew Filev, founder and CEO of Wrike.",

        "text": "I\u2019m not an introspective guy. When people invite me to lunch, assign me work or read my column at the doctor\u2019s office, I assume it\u2019s because they love me unconditionally. But during my junior year at Stanford, I was bedeviled by insecurity. My girlfriend dumped me. My parents broke up. And the night they called to tell me, a girl pity-made-out with me, during which I leaned over my loft bed to put Peter Gabriel\u2019s Passion in my five-CD changer, fell to the floor and sliced my foot open on the net of the arcade football-tossing game I had stuffed into my dorm room to try to make friends.\n\nSo in 1992, when my friend Martha Brockenbrough, the editor of our school paper, used the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to force the admissions office to show students the comments it had jotted on our applications, I, in my ego-weakened state, signed up, desperate to find out what people liked about me. Afterward I wrote a column about the horrors I read, and shortly thereafter Stanford began a policy of shredding all applications. But now that applications are filled out online, the school once again has all the records stored, digitally. So once again, Stanford students are using the law to gain access to the notes on their applications. If journalism is the first draft of history and history is doomed to repeat itself, then I am doomed to write the exact same column I wrote in my junior year of college.\n\nI called the current student who forced Stanford to do this, in order to stop him or her. He or she started a funny email-only campus newsletter in September called the Fountain Hopper, which, he or she said, requires total anonymity on his or her part. Not because he or she is worried about getting in trouble with the administration, but because he or she is nervous about a satirical newsletter being the top Google result for the rest of his or her life.\n\nTo persuade him or her to reconsider, I told him or her the story of my own torture. Back in 1992, I walked into the admissions office, most likely unshowered, eating pizza and holding a book I\u2019ve still never read. I was led to a room with 11 other misguided souls and given 30 minutes with a folder that I was told I was never meant to see. For people clever enough to select the smartest kids in the country, the admissions office knew very little about reverse psychology.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the word swim circled in red. I was told that swim was Stanford\u2019s term for the pile for applicants whom the admissions committee disagreed about, left in the middle of the water awaiting their fate. The comments included \u201cHe could drive you crazy.\u201d \u201cNot appropriate.\u201d \u201cHormonal overdrive.\u201d And \u201cNot especially funny.\u201d The most encouragement I got for my swim, which was apparently across the English Channel, were two smiley faces. This was before emoticons were popular, so they were hand-drawn and, therefore, if it\u2019s possible, even more patronizing.\n\nI asked to see what I had written in my essay to cause this reaction. In response to the admittedly creepy prompt \u201cIs there anything else we should know about you?\u201d I wrote a \u201cTop 10 Other Things You Should Know About Joel Stein,\u201d which included, \u201cBabes will be coming in and out of the room so often it\u2019ll seem like the bus depot across the street from Barbizon.\u201d Way worse, an essay I wrote included the line \u201cI was using humour as a crutch; trying to hide some of my insecurities behind a barrage of jokes instead of facing my fears.\u201d If they wouldn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d have to drown myself. It\u2019s bad enough to speak with a fake British accent. It\u2019s unacceptable to spell with one.\n\nMy story, however, didn\u2019t convince the young man or woman leading current students to their downfall. Frustrated at the folly of overeducated youth, I took solace in the fact that at least I am no longer 20 and desperately seeking strangers\u2019 approval. Besides, now that I\u2019ve had a successful writing career, I\u2019m sure Stanford is thrilled it accepted me. Pretty sure. But it would be even better to find out.\n\nSo I tracked down the former admissions dean, Jean Fetter, while she was in Paris with her husband Steven Chu, the former Secretary of Energy and Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist, who was there as a keynote speaker at the opening ceremony of UNESCO\u2019s International Year of Light and was the one I actually bothered since his email was easier to find. Dean Jean wrote me right back, confirming my assumption that she too has been thinking about this for 25 years. \u201cIf you read your file you know I admitted you with foresight: \u2018This young man will make us all laugh while dispensing wisdom,'\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo yes I\u2019d do it again, although I\u2019m thankful not to be responsible for selecting 5% of 42,000 applicants of 2014 and can\u2019t guarantee how you would fare in those circumstances.\u201d Seriously, you never want to find out what people really think of you.\n\nI hope Stanford will shred its digital files and let students return to having no idea what their strengths and weaknesses are. Otherwise, someone else is going to find out they\u2019re not funny and waste their career desperately, annoyingly, inappropriately trying to prove otherwise.",

        "text": "Raising venture capital is difficult for any first-time founders with a company that hasn\u2019t yet launched. Multiply that by 100 when your startup has any tangential relationship to cannabis.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that it took Edward Woodford, co-founder of Seed Commodities Exchange, a commodities trading platform for industrial hemp, to send 11,000 emails, travel 46,238 miles, and meet with 604 investors to raise Seed CX\u2019s first round of funding. At one point, Woodford sent so many messages on LinkedIn that the service temporarily banned him.\n\nIt\u2019s also little surprise that when Seed CX finally secured its $3.42 million convertible note, announced today, many of the company\u2019s 50 investors declined to make their names public. The ones that it did include were lead investor Charlie O\u2019Donnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures, Darren Herman, Tom Sosnoff, 500 Startups, iAngels, Struck Capital, Ron Geffner, David Adler, Christopher Lee, and Julien Codorniou.\n\nThe problem is not that Seed CX operates in a legal gray area \u2014 the platform only operates in areas where hemp farming is federally legal \u2014 or that its legal risk is any higher than a disruptive company like Uber or Airbnb. It\u2019s that most investment funds have a \u201cvice\u201d clause, which forbids them from touching anything that sounds like drugs.\n\nA number of venture investors liked Seed CX enough to invest their personal money. Seed CX\u2019s investor list is rounded out by commitments from several trading platforms, Woodford says.\n\nSeed CX\u2019s commodities trading platform is powered by GMEX Technologies, a London-based subsidiary of financial technology company GMEX Group. Seed CX is awaiting regulatory approval by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The startup hopes to be up and running with its first commodities: hemp seed, whole hemp plant and whole hemp plant extract, by the time the farming season starts in May.\n\nThe market for commodities, which dwarfs the stock market, allows traders to buy and sell anything from precious metals like gold to farm products like soybeans. As the U.S. government cuts subsidies for tobacco, many farmers in Kentucky have begun growing and processing hemp. Currently there are around 100 hemp farmers in the U.S. and 150 hemp processors. (Hemp farming and processing is federally legal under the Agricultural Act of 2014, but only in states with the proper infrastructure, which currently includes Kentucky and 26 others. Hemp itself is legal everywhere.) Woodford would not disclose how many farmers and traders had signed up to use Seed CX when it launches.\n\nIf it gets regulatory approval, Seed CX will be the first trading platform for hemp. Many commodities trading platforms start out specializing in one type of commodity to maximize liquidity, Woodford says. From there, Woodford says Seed CX will expand into other \u201cnascent, illiquid\u201d commodities.\n\nWoodford believes commodities traders will be eager to trade hemp because they like unique, idiosyncratic risks of a new market with a complicated legal framework. Also, many traders believe that the longer they are in a market before it becomes mainstream, the more edge they have. Likewise, for hemp farmers and processors, a commodities market allows them to lock in prices with derivatives contracts.\n\nEven though hemp is made from cannabis, Woodford is not eager to be associated with the marijuana industry. \u201cThe perception of cannabis \u2014 sometimes it widens peoples\u2019 eyes and sometimes it narrows them,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, it is a real turnoff.\u201d That\u2019s part of the excitement behind Seed CX, but Woodford is careful to note that hemp is different from marijuana.\n\nSeed CX\u2019s fundraising struggle speaks to the broader business world\u2019s mix of fear and excitement around cannabis legalization. Few startups in the category have been able to raise venture capital from traditional institutional investors.",

The town, located five miles from the active volcano, was a popular destination for Rome's distinguished citizens thanks to the sunny coastline nearby. When the volcano exploded in 79 AD, 2,000 people were killed by poisonous gases, ash and crushed rocks.\n\nThe tragedy should have served as a warning to future generations, but fertile grounds and the beauty of islands have caused cities to pop up in the shadows of volcanoes. Many of the world's coolest destinations are actually in danger of becoming the next Pompeii.\n\nWilliam Menke, professor of Earth and Environmental studies at Columbia, identifies four cities as candidates for being threatened by the 'Most Dangerous Volcano in the World.' Seattle, Tokyo, Mexico City and Naples. The massive populations of the cities and suburbs relatively close to the mountains put them a risk of huge losses of life.\n\nClick below to see popular travel destinations that are secretly threatened by volcanoes:\n\nCities and vacation spots threatened by volcanoes\n\nThe idyllic Greek island's picturesque white houses are actually perched on overlapping shield volcanoes. In fact, the group of islands was entirely formed by volcanic activity. The eruption of Santorini in Greece in 1,650 B.C. was perhaps one of the largest witnessed by humans. The most recent eruption occurred in 1950, and there has been ongoing seismic activity ever since.\n\nThe southern Italian city is precariously located between Mount Vesuvius, and a lesser-known threat, the Campi Fiegrei caldera. The latter is a supervolcano that has been called 'the most potentially hazardous on the planet.' Its last eruption was just in 1538. There has been activity in recent years like earthquakes and parts of the caldera rising. If it were to erupt, the Campi Fiegrei would kill millions. But for now, it is just a tourist attraction like Naples\u2019 famous pizza.\n\nMount Rainier last erupted in the 19th century and has been closely watched by scientists ever since. U.S. Geological Survey has described Mount Rainier as 'an active volcano that will erupt again.' It is located about 58 miles southeast of Seattle, which may seem far, but suburbs and tourism surrounding the mountain put many at risk.\n\nMount Fuji has erupted at least 16 times since 781 A.D., with the most recent occurring in 1707-1708. In 2011, an earthquake caused geographic disturbances in Japan.\n\nFlorent Brenguier, a researcher at the Institute of Earth Sciences put out an ominous warning, stating \"our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it's in a critical state.\"\n\nLast year, Mount Fuji climbers were urged to wear helmets in case of an unexpected eruption.\n\nDramatic footage from April 2016 showed ash two miles high spewing out of Popocat\u00e9petl volcano in Mexico. As many as five daily explosions occurred in the beginning of July 2016. About 25 million people live within 62 miles of the crater of the stratovolcano, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMauna Loa is one of five large volcanoes that forms the Hawaiian islands. The whopping 60 mile-long volcano makes up nearly half of the entire island. Since 1832, Mauna Loa has erupted 39 times. According to USGS estimates, the volcano has erupted an average of once every 6 years over the past three millennia.\n\nMont Pel\u00e9e looms over this stunning French island in the Caribbean. It is a haunting reminder of the eruption of 1902, which wiped out the former capital of St-Pierre, known at the time as the \u2018Paris of the West Indies.\u2019 There were only two known survivors out of 28,000 in the town.\n\nDespite its tragic past, the island has become a hotbed of tourism again thanks to its beautiful beaches and French connection.\n\nUntil recently, tourists and amateur mountaineers in Ecuador were drawn to Cotopaxi, a quiet, snow-capped volcano only 34 miles away from the capital city. But in 2015, seismologists recorded hundreds of earthquakes and the volcano began to release a plume of ash. After 75 years of inactivity, the volcano now poses a threat to the millions who live nearby.\n\nAnd Cotopaxi isn\u2019t the only volcano threatening locals and tourists. There are at least six that foreign governments, like the U.K., are warning potential visitors about.\n\nThe iconic Tanzania mountain is comprised of three volcanic cones: Shira, Kibo and Mawenzi. The last major eruption from Kibo occurred 360,000 years ago, but minor volcanic activity happened 200 years ago. Although there has not been any recent activity, Kibo is dormant, not extinct, which still poses a risk to one of world\u2019s favorite places to climb.\n\nMore from AOL.com: A dead volcano in Rome has come back to life Amanda Steele reveals the 'craziest experience' she's ever had Budget better: 11 travel expenses that are always worth the splurge",

        "text": "In the aftermath of the horrible Friday the 13th attacks in Paris, many members of Congress quickly took the opportunity to blast the Obama administration\u2019s failure to appropriately counter ISIS in Iraq, Syria and beyond. It is fair game to challenge the administration\u2019s strategy, but these critiques miss an important point: Congress has abdicated its fundamental duty to debate, vote on and shape the extent of the current war on ISIS. Our post-Paris discussion about what more the U.S. should do must include Congress taking responsibility for our involvement, rather than trying to duck accountability.\n\nThe founders of our country crafted a constitution with a revolutionary idea about war. James Madison knew that war had been fundamentally a matter for the executive\u2014king, sultan, emir, emperor, monarch\u2014throughout human history. He determined that our nation would take the decision to initiate war away from the executive and instead vest it in the people\u2019s elected legislative branch. Absent an imminent attack on America, its people, or its national security interests, when the President as Commander-in-Chief can always act unilaterally to defend the country, we are not supposed to be at war without a vote of Congress.\n\nPresident Obama launched an airstrike campaign against ISIS on Aug. 8, 2014. In nearly 16 months of war, four American civilian hostages and 10 service members have been killed. Nearly 3,600 of our troops are deployed in the anti-ISIS mission today. We\u2019ve spent $5 billion and flown over 6200 airstrikes. And the ISIS threat has mutated beyond Iraq and Syria\u2014with obvious presence now in Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan and other nations. The attacks in Paris, with hundreds of innocent people killed and injured, occurred within days of ISIS claiming credit for a suicide bombing in Lebanon and the downing of a Russian passenger airliner in Egypt. And this week brings renewed threats of attacks on other cities, including Washington. ISIS is not going away.\n\nBut Congress has been strangely silent about the war. We criticize the President, but won\u2019t vote to authorize, stop or refine what he is doing. Congressional silence sends a message. Our allies wonder whether we have the resolve to work with them to stop this threat. ISIS must take comfort in the seeming ambivalence of Congress. Most damning, our troops\u2014ordered to risk their lives thousands of miles from home\u2014wonder whether Congress even supports the dangerous missions they must carry out every day.\n\nWe introduced a bill in June to spark a debate and get Congress to declare that ISIS is a sufficient threat to warrant American military action. We wanted to show that there could be bipartisan agreement on this point. A recent letter of 35 House members\u2014Democrat and Republican alike\u2014to Speaker Paul Ryan urges that Congress work together to put our imprimatur on using American military force against ISIS.\n\nThere are important questions to resolve going forward, especially the role\u2014if any\u2014of U.S. ground forces. Questions about whether to \u201csunset\u201d an ISIS-specific AUMF and what to do about the 14-year-old statute which currently serves as the administration\u2019s legal underpinning for action against ISIS, remain. None of them have easy answers, but we were not elected to the U.S. Senate to take votes on what\u2019s easy and avoid votes on issues that are hard. It is our responsibility to weigh in on this grave matter of foreign policy.\n\nA Congressional debate, at long last, about this war on ISIS will educate the American public about the stakes involved. It will force the administration to give thought to, and lay out a clear strategy that encompasses military and non-military dimensions\u2014including diplomatic and humanitarian measures\u2014for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIS, and for U.S. involvement with other nations in this struggle. It should let our troops, our allies and our adversaries know of our unity and resolve. Finally, it will vindicate the Constitutional role of Congress in making the sober decision about when military force is necessary.",

        "text": "Every culture has its own complicated set of rules about sex. The fact that rules are made to be broken only adds to the fun. That is probably all we can conclude from the case of the Pussy Boat.\n\nThe artist Megumi Igarashi, known as Rokudenashiko, has been found guilty of obscenity in Japan for publishing data from which it is possible to 3D print a replica of her vagina, to raise funds for a kayak inspired by her genitalia. To any westerner who has ever looked at Japanese art, it seems a startling verdict.\n\nRelated: Is Nobuyoshi Araki's photography art or porn?\n\nFor eyes trained by a Christian tradition freighted with anxieties about the sinfulness of sex, the happy eroticism of Japan\u2019s shunga art is a delight. Many of the greatest Japanese artists lavished their skills on sensual imagery in woodblock prints made from the 17th to 19th centuries. My favourites include Hokusai\u2019s 1814 print The Dream of the Fisherman\u2019s Wife, in which a woman receives ecstatic pleasure from an octopus\u2019s tentacles and beak, and another by Suzuki Harunobu, done in the 1760s, of lovers seen through a window.\n\nThe erotic art of early modern Japan continues today in the photography of Nobuyoshi Araki, whose images of women tied up in varieties of ways are regarded by many as major works of contemporary art. That\u2019s without even considering the pop art world of manga, with its sometimes seriously disturbing images of sexual violence and abuse.\n\nJapan really does have an extremely libertarian attitude to the visual depiction of sex. It was only in 2014 that it outlawed the possession of child abuse images. Manga and anime were specifically excluded from the ban, prompting a debate around child protection and artistic freedom that rumbles on today. How can it be OK for comics to publish underage pornography but illegal to invite people to 3D scan your vagina?\n\nIgarashi is exposing the illogicality and irrationality of Japan\u2019s obscenity law \u2013 her vaginal kayak is a deliberate satire of a nonsensical set of rules. Yet no culture is rational about the sexual images and acts it licenses or forbids. Certainly, the west is in no position to look down on Japan, given its own strange and ever-changing attitudes.\n\nRelated: The top 10 female nudes in art\n\nEuropean and American ideas about art and sex are still haunted by Christianity. The nude remains a fraught and contentious arena \u2013 the painter George Shaw\u2019s conflation of \u201cartistic\u201d nudes with pornographic magazines in his new exhibition at the National Gallery wittily plays on those anxieties.\n\nGetting my Guardian at the newsagent\u2019s the other day, I was approached by an American couple who asked which paper had the \u201clascivious picture on page two\u201d. After a moment\u2019s hesitation \u2013 should I engage in a debate about sexism? \u2013 I told them it was the Sun, and it was page 3 they were looking for. They were disappointed. What they saw was \u201cmilder\u201d than they were expecting. Perhaps they hoped for something more like Araki.\n\nThat Japanese cultural mixture of extreme freedom and suppression, to which Igarashi has drawn attention, vindicates the French philosopher Michel Foucault. In his final work, The History of Sexuality, this controversial thinker argued that far from being the universal urge Freud identified, libido is shaped by \u201cdiscourses\u201d of sexuality that not only regulate but also shape and promote desire. Sex is not natural but cultural, a realm as strange as an octopus\u2019s garden.",

        "text": "Guardians of the Galaxy, the latest franchise to join Marvel\u2019s ever-expanding cinematic universe, is a marked departure from the recognizable stable of superheroes movie-goers are used to. Instead of Iron Man or Captain America, we\u2019re treated to a motley crew that consists of an everyman, a green Zoe Saldana, a live-action Kratos, Ranger Rick\u2019s temperamental cousin and an overgrown weed. But don\u2019t let their appearances or the unfamiliar intimidate you. Guardians of the Galaxy is laugh-out-loud funny and totally worth checking out.\n\nTo help you get ready for Guardians of the Galaxy, here are a couple things you should know.\n\nAbducted from Earth by aliens when he was a child, Peter Quill (Star-Lord), played by Chris Pratt, is an interstellar adventurer who travels the stars in search of riches and, of course, women.\n\nThe adopted daughter of Thanos (more on him below), Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, is a deadly green-skinned assassin with a troubled past who seeks redemption for her past crimes.\n\nPlayed by professional wrestler Dave Bautista, Drax is an imposing force who is on a warpath to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter. The tattoos that cover his gargantuan body tell the story of his life.\n\nOn the other side of the size spectrum is Rocket, a genetically altered and cybernetically enhanced raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. Don\u2019t let his size fool you though\u2013he\u2019s a bounty hunter and a mechanical genius with a penchant for blowing things up.\n\nVin Diesel voices Groot, a walking, talking tree-like creature that has the ability to grow itself into various forms at will. He is Rocket\u2019s bounty hunter partner and cellulose strongman. Groot\u2019s vocabulary, however, in Hodor-like fashion, is limited to only three words: \u201cI am Groot.\u201d\n\nThe Nova Corps is the military/police force that protects the planet Xandar. It boasts a considerable amount of corpsmen within its ranks, ranging from the rank-and-file Corpsman Dey, played by John C. Reilly, to their leader Nova Prime, played by Glenn Close.\n\nThe blue-skinned alien Yondu, played by Michael Rooker, is the leader of a ragtag band of intergalactic bandits called Ravagers. He\u2019s a surrogate father to Quill and carries around a deadly arrow that he can control by whistling. In short, don\u2019t mess with the \u2018du.\n\nFirst seen in the Thor: The Dark World post-credit scene, The Collector, played by Benicio Del Toro, makes an appearance in Guardians. The Collector, as his nom de guerre implies, is literally an intergalactic hoarder. He maintains the largest collection of species and relics in the galaxy, but always has room for one more.\n\nRonan, played by Lee Pace, is a fanatical member of the Kree race. Despite a peace treaty between the Kree and the Xandarians, he continues to fight a one-man war against his people\u2019s ancient foe, vowing at nothing short of the complete annihilation of Xandar.\n\nIf you stuck around for the post-credit scene in The Avengers, you would have been treated to a glimpse of Thanos, the purple-skinned alien baddy that was behind Loki\u2019s mayhem in the movie. Thanos is a supervillain with enough power to destroy worlds and subjugate countless more. Voiced by Josh Brolin, Thanos makes an appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy in a not-so-subtle foreshadowing of what awaits the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy is out in theaters on August 1, 2014.",

        "text": "The city of Cleveland has had a colorful history. The Cuyahoga River, which runs through the city, famously caught fire in 1969 thanks to rampant pollution, and it wasn\u2019t the first time. In 1978 it became the first U.S. city to default on its debts since the Great Depression. Cleveland sports fans have had to endure more anguish than those in any other city. The city has been dubbed with a less than endearing nickname: the Mistake by the Lake.\n\nThis year Cleveland takes the top spot in our third annual ranking of America\u2019s Most Miserable Cities. Cleveland secured the position thanks to its high unemployment, high taxes, lousy weather, corruption by public officials and crummy sports teams (Cavaliers of the NBA excepted).\n\nSlide Show: America\u2019s 20 Most Miserable Cities\n\nMisery was on the rise around the country last year. Sure the stock market was up big, but so were unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcy filings. Meanwhile housing prices, the U.S. dollar and approval ratings for Congress continued their downward spiral.\n\nThe widely tracked Misery Index initiated by economist Arthur Okun, which combines unemployment and inflation rates started 2009 at 7.3 and rose to 12.7 by the end of the year thanks to soaring joblessness. That is the highest level since 1983.\n\nOur Misery Measure takes into account unemployment, as well as eight other issues that cause people anguish. The metrics include taxes (both sales and income), commute times, violent crime and how its pro sports teams have fared over the past two years. We also factored in two indexes put together by Portland, Ore., researcher Bert Sperling that gauge weather and Superfund pollution sites. Lastly we considered corruption based on convictions of public officials in each area as tracked by the Public Integrity Section of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nWe expanded the list of cities under consideration this year to include the 200 largest metropolitan statistical areas (in years past we\u2019ve examined 150), which led to a shuffling in the ranks. Any area with a population of more than 245,000 was eligible.\n\nCleveland nabbed the top spot as a result of poor ratings across the board. It was the only city that fell in the bottom half of the rankings in all nine categories. Many residents are heading for greener pastures. There has been a net migration out of the Cleveland metro area of 71,000 people over the past five years. Population for the city itself has been on a steady decline and is now less than half of it what it was 50 years ago.\n\nCleveland ranked near the bottom when looking at corruption. Northern Ohio has seen 309 public officials convicted of crimes over the past 10 years according to the Justice Department. A current FBI investigation of public officials in Cuyahoga County (where Cleveland is located) has ensnared more than two dozen government employees and businessmen on charges including bribery, fraud and tax evasion.\n\nOn the housing front Cleveland is dealing with thousands of abandoned homes. The city contributed to its foreclosure problem by providing down payments to many people that could not afford homes through the federally funded Afford-A-Home program. Cleveland led by Mayor Frank Jackson sued 21 large investment banks in 2008 who he felt were complicit in the subprime and foreclosure crisis that hit Cleveland hard. A federal judge dismissed the suit last year, but the city is appealing the ruling.\n\nA 19% decline in foreclosures last year is possibly a glimmer of hope that the housing situation is starting to improve, although Cleveland still ranks in the top third of all metros for foreclosure rates according to RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed property. Cleveland and Cuyahoga County were awarded $41 million last month from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This money will go towards demolition of homes, foreclosure prevention and the rehabilitation of homes.\n\nThere are certainly bright spots in Cleveland. Downtown has experienced a revival over the past 15 years helped in part by the construction of three new sports venues for the city\u2019s NFL, NBA and baseball teams. The Cleveland Clinic is one of the top medical centers in the U.S. and the largest employer in northeast Ohio.\n\nMayor Jackson\u2019s chief of staff Ken Silliman calls 2010 a very exciting year for Cleveland. He points to three projects in development for the city. The first is the Cleveland Medical Mart which is a convention center that targets the medical and health care industries. Next is a casino plan. In November Ohio voters approved casinos in four cities, and Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert is leading a group that hopes to have a Cleveland casino up and running in three years. Lastly is the Flats East Bank project, which ran into funding issues during the financial crisis. The waterfront development will include an office tower, hotel and space for retail and dining.\n\n\u201cClevelanders over the years have developed a tenacity to deal with these kinds of situations, and we are very aggressive in attempting to solve our problems rather than awaiting someone else\u2019s solutions,\u201d says Silliman.\n\nOther cities on the list include Memphis, which came in third thanks to the second-worst rate of violent crime in the U.S. and an alarming rate of convicted public officials. Detroit, ravaged by the ailing auto industry was fourth. Flint, Mich., was fifth. Also on the list? Chicago (No. 10) and New York City (No. 16). Torturous commute times and nosebleed-inducing taxes are the high prices locals pay for the cultural opportunities and corporate headquarters located there.\n\nOur most miserable city last year, Stockton, Calif., nabbed the second spot on this year\u2019s list. Unemployment and crime continue to be major issues. Stockton ranked seventh worst in both of these areas. Stockton residents have average commutes that are among the highest in the country and, like all Californians, they suffer from onerous sales and income taxes.\n\nStockton Mayor Ann Johnston says the city is working to fix its problems. It has seen a reduction in crime in recent months as it targets troubled areas with an increased police presence. On the economic front, the city recently expanded the Port of Stockton, which it hopes will attract new companies. Stockton is an agricultural community, but the Mayor says the city is working to diversify its economic base and echoes Silliman\u2019s comments about Cleveland. \u201cWe\u2019re an All-American city,\u201d says Mayor Johnston. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because we sit on our hands and do nothing. It\u2019s because we recognize our problems and work to solve them.\u201d\n\nSlide Show: America\u2019s 20 Most Miserable Cities\n\nComments are turned off for this post.",

        "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla. - It was on the plane from Shanghai to Beijing last year that Dorothy Lipson of Delray Beach, Fla., suddenly began to cough up blood: first in streaks, then in frightening, tissue-soaking spoonfuls.\n\nTing-Li Wang/The New York Times\n\nPatients like Ilse Kaplan, left, receive more personal attention from Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky in exchange for an annual fee of about $1,650.\n\nTing-Li Wang/The New York Times\n\nA lower patient load means Dr. Kaminetsky's waiting room is often empty, but staff members still keep a supply of snacks there just in case.\n\nBut Mrs. Lipson, who was in China visiting an expatriate daughter, was lucky on two counts. First, her daughter happens to run a corporation that builds gleaming Western-style hospitals in China; Ms. Lipson was rushed to the Beijing hospital on landing. And second, Mrs. Lipson's internist back home in Florida is Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky, one of a new breed of \"concierge\" or \"boutique\" doctors who, in exchange for a yearly cash retainer, lavish time, phone calls and attention on patients, using the latest in electronic communications to streamline their care.\n\nSince its debut in 1996, concierge medicine has evoked criticism from many corners. Some ethicists say it is exacerbating the inequities in American health care. Insurance regulators have raised concerns about fraud. Government watchdogs, worried that it threatens the tenuous equilibrium of the health care system, are keeping an eye on trends.\n\n\"Concierge care is like a new country club for the rich,\" Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said at a joint economic committee hearing in Congress last year. \"The danger is that if a large number of doctors choose to open up these types of practices, the health care system will become even more inequitable than it is today.\"\n\nBut for Mrs. Lipson, who pays $1,650 a year, the niceties enabled by concierge medicine can make all the difference.\n\nDr. Kaminetsky was in daily touch with her doctors in Beijing. E-mail messages, X-ray reports and digitalized images flew back and forth. When the bleeding was stabilized and Mrs. Lipson returned home, Dr. Kaminetsky immediately connected her with a local specialist for a biopsy of her diseased lungs, and then with infectious disease experts for treatment of the unusual infection that was found.\n\nMrs. Lipson's long convalescence was seamless, with none of the snags that can magnify the misery of serious illness: no long hours in strange waiting rooms, no lost X-ray or culture reports, no contradictory pronouncements by specialists confused by missing information. Dr. Kaminetsky's office coordinated all her appointments, tests and treatments. He personally telephoned her with all results and saw her as often as necessary to make sure everything went smoothly.\n\nNow, still on medication over 18 months later, Mrs. Lipson applauds her foresight in signing up for this deluxe model of medical care. The yearly expense, she points out, is far smaller than more traditional luxuries like cruises or late-model cars. \"I highly recommend it,\" she said. \"It's well worth the money.\"\n\nAnyone searching the country for a group of patients who are perfectly happy with their medical care, neither brutalized by the system nor fearful that the onset of a serious illness will plunge them into a morass of confusion and neglect, need look no farther than Dr. Kaminetsky's waiting room here in Boca Raton.\n\nNot that the waiting room usually has anyone in it. One promise made to patients paying for concierge service is that waiting will not be a part of their health care experience. Patients are guaranteed that phone calls will be returned promptly, appointments will be scheduled on a same-day basis if necessary, and appointment times will be honored. A bowl of fruit salad and platters of bagels and sponge cake set out for patients in the waiting room can go barely touched over the course of a day, and the television often plays to an empty couch.\n\nA relatively simple tradeoff is responsible: the extra fees collected from patients let concierge doctors, who leave regular practice for concierge medicine, slash their caseloads. Before Dr. Kaminetsky became a concierge doctor five years ago he had 2,500 patients in his practice - a standard number for most primary care internists. His list now numbers 600.\n\nSick and well alike, patients are delighted with the results.\n\nJoan Holzman, 69, takes no medicines and has no health problems; she comes to the office once a year for a physical exam, an X-ray, an electrocardiogram and blood tests. \"I adore it,\" Ms. Holzman said. \"Before, wherever you went you felt like cattle. But everyone here is top-notch - the doctors, the secretaries, the nurses. They're warm, like family. It's a wonderful feeling of security.\"",

We're the front lines, man, fleas fighting a giant.''\n\nIt is a clear, crisp, gorgeous winter afternoon in the high desert in Nevada, and Michael Heizer, who has spent the past 32 years and many millions of mostly other people's dollars constructing ''City'' -- one of the biggest sculptures any modern artist has ever built, one and a quarter miles long and more than a quarter of a mile wide -- is in a state of extreme agitation, even for him. His pique is rising as he maneuvers his truck down a bumpy mountain pass, filling the truck's cabin with cigar smoke. I sense that he's rather enjoying himself.\n\nWe are driving through Murphy Gap. Pinyon and juniper cluster along the slopes on either side. This narrow, serpentine passage of astonishing beauty cuts through the Golden Gate Range, far from civilization. Aside from Heizer's voice and the truck's engine, there is an endless, empty, engulfing silence.\n\nCoal Valley, on the eastern side of the mountain range, is a desolate, flat plain of yellow rabbit brush and silver sage for grazing cattle. To the west, Heizer's valley, Garden Valley, is vast and nearly uninhabited. Size is deceptive out here. ''City'' looks from the edge of the valley like a low-lying bump, barely visible. When you drive just a mile from it, south across the valley, it basically disappears into the brush. But picture a sculpture the size of the Washington Mall, nearly from the steps of the Capitol to the Washington Monument, swallowing many of the museums on either side. That's how big it is. Only once you're inside do you see all the mounds, pits, passageways, plazas, ramps and terraced dirt, most of the sculpture having been dug below ground level, masked from outside by berms. The shapes echo the mountains. ''I'm not selling the view,'' Heizer contradicts when I mention this. ''You can't even see the landscape unless you're standing at the edge of the sculpture.'' True. Even so, the echoes are plain as day.\n\nWe are maybe 30 miles from Nellis Air Force Base and the military's supersecret Area 51, and more than 100 miles from Yucca Mountain, where the federal government, if all goes as planned, will begin to collect the nation's nuclear waste in 2010. Trains will transport the waste from across the country, through the middle of Atlanta and Chicago and Salt Lake City and Kansas City, to Caliente, a town just north of here. From there, more than 300 miles of track will have to be laid, at a cost of more than $1 billion, to carry the waste the rest of the way.\n\nAs it is currently conceived, the route will cut across Garden Valley, within ear- and eyeshot of Heizer's sculpture and the ranch right next to it where he lives, a kind of survivalist compound of cinder block and solar panels, an oasis of cottonwoods and wild plum trees in the middle of a wide, empty plain. Having moved long ago to this virtual end of the earth, and having also moved heaven and earth to build in isolation his immense sculpture, Heizer now finds the federal government is plotting, as he sees things, to ruin it and him.\n\nHeizer knows it's highly unlikely that he or anyone else will suddenly stop Yucca cold, but he says he's hoping at least to persuade Department of Energy officials at this 11th hour to redirect the tracks next door through Coal Valley and Murphy Gap. Of course he is deeply pessimistic. ''I've always been a pessimist,'' he tells me, ''but now I think things are going to get really, really bad.'' Squinting into a fresh plume of cigar smoke, which rises like a dark cloud around him, he starts imagining first the rail, then wells, then electric power lines invading the valley, while ''sniveling toady'' politicians, as he calls them, do nothing.\n\nHis soliloquy crescendos, linking defense contractors like Kellogg Brown & Root and Bechtel to the government as a sinister cabal machinating against him -- ''I wouldn't be surprised if they sent out a hit squad to kill me!'' -- when the silence of Murphy Gap is suddenly shattered by a heart-stopping boom.\n\nAn F-16 buzzes our truck. It looks as if it can't be more than 100 feet overhead, turned sideways to maneuver low through the snaking pass. Then as quickly as it appears, it's gone.\n\nWho knows? I think. Even paranoids may be right sometimes.",

But in August, city officials granted Jerry and David Wolkoff, who own the building, permission to demolish the site.\n\nThe surprise overnight whitewash brought condemnation from artists, fans and volunteers who had gathered at the spot on Tuesday, many in tears.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s super disrespectful is that the whole thing about 5 Pointz is: it\u2019s legal painting,\" said 5 Pointz volunteer Rebekah Kennedy. \"For someone to come in and wash it away \u2026 that's the biggest vandal.\"\n\nShe said that before the destruction, volunteers had been working on a way to preserve the art or the building as a landmark. \u201cTo just take it away is the biggest 'fuck you' that can happen,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, volunteers taped large pieces of white to the walls inside the building\u2019s loading dock center, where halal cart workers were still driving in and out of the yard. People had taken markers to the signs in tribute: \u201cWe played by the rules,\u201d read one. Another bore a quote from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg address, which was delivered 150 years ago, today: \u201cWe are met on a great battlefield of that war.\u201d\n\nOwner Jerry Wolkoff defended the overnight destruction in an interview with NBC 4 New York. \"I can imagine going one piece, one piece, and going through hell, torture to everybody,\" he said. \"So I said, 'Let me do it one time and end this torture one time,\u2019\u201d he said. He compared the action to forcing a child to take medicine.\n\n\"In the new building we're going to let them come back, and it's going to be similar and better,\" Wolkoff said, explaining that the new building will have a 60-foot wraparound wall for graffiti. \"They're upset with me now, but it's the right thing for both of us.\u201d\n\nHe later expanded his defence in an interview with New York magazine: \"I told the police to be there. The last thing I wanted was any confrontation. I didn't want any of them to be arrested. I have so much respect for them. It's my building, I can paint on it. I would feel terrible if someone got arrested.\"\n\nComedy writer Joe Garden, who passes the spot on his way to work, called the destruction \"an abomination\" and said it \"really seems spiteful and unnecessary, verging on cruel\".\n\nConfirmed 5 Pointz graffiti Mecca was painted over last night pic.twitter.com/tweDokQR2Y\n\nPainting over 5 Pointz before tearing it down is one of the most artistically and culturally disrespectful moves I've seen in a while. Damn.\n\nDanny Simmons, a gallery owner and artist who testified in a lawsuit brought by 5 Pointz representatives, said the building has been \u201ca repository of hip-hop history and a place of beauty and wonder\u201d. Simmons is the older brother of hip-hop mogul Russell, and Joseph, or Rev Run, of Run DMC, and all three were closely tied to the rise of hip-hop culture.\n\nDanny Simmons said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a major tourist attraction for the city \u2013 a place where young and old could go for free and let their imaginations run wild. It was an inspiration to art\u2019s free spirit and spoke volumes to artists like myself about color and form. With the painting over and razing of this building, the arts and NYC has been sorely diminished. It will be missed, but the spirit of art for and by the people lives on.\u201d\n\nArtists have been painting on the property since the early 1990s, with permission from the Wolkoffs. But the owners decided in 2010 to demolish the building to make room for two luxury residential towers.\n\n5 Pointz representatives, led by curator Jonathan Cohen, also known as Meres One, had been at odds with the Wolkoffs for several years after an artist was seriously injured in 2009 when an outdoor staircase broke. New York\u2019s building department ordered the largest structure in the complex to close following the incident, but in mid-October the building was still standing.\n\nSince the city granted the property owners permission to demolish the building, Meres and fellow curator Marie Cecile Flageul have been fighting a losing battle.

But in this case, Francis is leaving out the Israeli leader who matters most.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as head of government, is the key decision-maker in any peace negotiations with the Palestinians. Yet the Pope\u2019s invitation from a Bethlehem mass on Sunday was extended not to Netanyahu but to Shimon Peres, the famously dovish 90-year-old statesman whose seven-year term in the largely symbolic office of president expires in two months.\n\nPeres readily accepted the Pope\u2019s invitation to travel to the Vatican for \u201ca heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace,\u201d as Francis put it. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said a quick yes, too. That puts together in a room two men of peace who routinely voice the need for a two-state solution to the as-yet-intractable conflict\u2013and who, according to contemporaneous news reports, met discreetly several times in 2011.\n\nAs Peres tells it, he and Abbas came within a whisker of fashioning an agreement that would have resolved the matter by agreeing on the terms for fashioning a state called \u201cPalestine\u201d beside Israel.\n\nBut Netanyahu forbad Peres from closing the deal, according to Peres, who recounted the tortured history earlier this month to an Israeli television station, shortly after the apparent collapse of the Kerry negotiations.\n\nAnd while there is nothing at all wrong with prayer, least of all for peace, the Pope\u2019s invitation truly was one that neither side could refuse. The Israelis and Palestinians have been talking so long about peace \u2013 20 years now, since the breakthrough known as the Oslo Accords that introduced then then-exciting idea of sitting down face-to-face with the enemy \u2013 that to be seen rejecting talks is to be viewed as the villain.\n\nBoth sides have strong incentives to be perceived as inclined toward an agreement, and both sides have strong incentives to avoid the particulars required to produce one. Which is why an invitation to keep things as vague as praying for peace is something of a godsend, especially coming from the most charismatic religious figure in the world. Where\u2019s the downside in that?\n\nNone that\u2019s apparent. But only a fool would rule out this Pope. After barely a year in office, the Argentine Francis has shown himself nothing if not a man of this world, shrewd, and deeply committed to challenging the status quo. It was en route through Bethlehem to the mass where he delivered his seemingly airy invitation that Francis made his unscheduled, quietly thrilling stop at the Separation Barrier. He prayed in silence, and briefly touched his head against the gritty concrete, possibly the way a ram does, in warning.",

It\u2019s been a very busy and exciting time at Apple and I\u2019d like to review some of the highlights of our June quarter. We hosted our best ever Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference last month with over 20 million people from around the world watching our keynote session, which is the a record. We\u2019ve had overwhelming response from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has been redesigned with a fresh look and powerful new apps and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store. With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways.\n\nCustomers can start on activity like writing an email on one device and pass it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They will even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. These are features that only Apple can deliver. With iOS 8, we have opened over 4000 APIs providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, enables wide use of Touch ID to securely authenticate users within apps and lets developers further customize the user experience with major extensibility features such as third-party keyboards.\n\nWe have also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience within building Apple platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire classes of unsafe code and generates apps that run lightning fast. It\u2019s easy to learn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new categories of apps. We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift will result in a huge leap forward for the Apple ecosystem and we can\u2019t wait to what developers will create with Yosemite, iOS 8 and Swift.\n\nWhen we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating system for iPhone. Over the years we\u2019ve extended it to the iPod family with iPod Touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, accessories and services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant ecosystem. We\u2019re extending iOS in even more dimensions as customers around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives, at home, at school, at work and on the go. We\u2019re putting a huge effort into delivering the best experience to our customers wherever they use iOS. That includes a safe and intuitive user interface for driving, called CarPlay, which is being integrated by 29 major car brands including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo; and after-market systems like Pioneer and Alpine.\n\nWe\u2019ve created a new tool for developers called HealthKit, which allows health and fitness apps work to together and empowers customers to choose what health data they share. We\u2019re taking the first steps in this area in collaboration with the Mayo clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive data from a blood pressure app, for example and share it with a physician, or a nutrition app can inform fitness apps how many calories are being consumed each day. Our ARM health app will provide an easy to read dashboard of all health and fitness data.\n\nWe\u2019re enabling new ways to control light and doors and thermostats and other connected devices around the house using Siri with the HomeKit feature of iOS 8. And in the Enterprise, we are including new security, productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to enterprise customers around the world. We are working together to provide companies access to the power of Big Data analytics, right on every employee\u2019s iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we will collaborate to bring over 100 Mobile First apps to enterprise clients, each addressing a specific industry need or opportunity.\n\nThis is a radical step for Enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity for Apple but more importantly, it\u2019s great for productivity and creativity of our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the car, to the workplace, home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be and we\u2019re incredibly excited about our plans.\n\nTurning to our financial results\u2026\n\nLINK: Seeking Appha\u2019s Earnings Call Transcript\n\nFollow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter at @philiped.

        "text": "Even though the forms that have become common musical currency \u2014 sonatas, symphonies, concertos \u2014 underwent lengthy, complex processes of development, we sometimes talk about them as if their materialization was some discrete, easily pinpointed event. A prime example is the string quartet, which is commonly said to have been \u201cinvented\u201d by Franz Joseph Haydn around the middle of the 18th century. In fact, the development of the form unfolded gradually, tentatively and in overlapping phases.\n\nAn inventive program in the summer series of the Society for Historically Informed Performance (SoHIP) is meant to tell at least part of that story. Titled \u201cBirth of the String Quartet,\u201d it includes pieces for two violins, viola, and cello by Georg Philipp Telemann, Johann Friedrich Fasch, and Franz Xaver Richter, three composers in whose work the quartet grows out of its Baroque origins, and ends with a quartet from Haydn\u2019s Opus 1 set.\n\nThe three performances come courtesy of the aptly named Emergence Quartet: violinists Emily Dahl and Lisa Goddard, violist Zoe Kemmerling, and cellist Emily Davidson. The period-instrument group formed last fall, and gave its first performance earlier this year. It was the brainchild of Davidson, a Baroque cellist who was looking to form a chamber ensemble, and was surprised that there didn\u2019t seem to be a regularly performing quartet in Boston\u2019s thriving early-music scene.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a perfect outlet to bring together general classical music fans \u2014 almost everybody loves the string quartet \u2014 to the period-performance angle and explore this repertoire,\u201d Davidson said in a recent phone interview. \u201cWhat kind of music [the string quartet] was coming out of, and the first quartets that were on the scene.\u201d\n\nThe Telemann sonata that opens the program offers a glimpse of the Baroque rhetoric out of which the quartet emerged. Sonatas of this era usually featured a number of solo instruments and a bass line, with figuration that functioned as the harmonic guide for a continuo player (usually on a keyboard).\n\nWhat\u2019s notable about the Telemann piece, Davidson explained, is that there is no continuo part indicated. The cello line simply functions on its own. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big defining factor, if we start to see stand-alone bass lines, rather than a line with a figured bass above it that\u2019s intended to be played by a chordal instrument,\u201d she said.\n\nA sonata by Fasch (1688-1758), by contrast, was actually written with continuo in mind. Yet, Davidson said, \u201cthe writing works quite well in the string quartet style,\u201d without accompaniment. And whereas the Telemann is harmonically conventional, Fasch\u2019s writing is unexpectedly adventurous. \u201cIt\u2019s very dramatic, very surprising music \u2014 Fasch was always sort of pushing the boundaries and writing these outrageous, almost shocking harmonies that were far beyond his time.\u201d\n\nA piece by Richter (1709-89) is the first on the concert to use the title \u201cquartet.\u201d Here, another part of the puzzle drops into place: the equality of all four instrumental parts. \u201cRichter really starts playing with the role of each instrument,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cYou see a lot of melodies being passed off \u2014 where the viola\u2019s usually just playing harmony, we\u2019ll get a moment where it takes over. The cello will often switch off from a bass line role and jump up into the tenor clef, which is an exciting new move.\u201d\n\nGiven the adventurous writing by these two rather obscure composers, Haydn\u2019s G-major Quartet may seem surprisingly conventional. Its five-movement lineup resembles that of a divertimento, an older form, more than what we think of as a string quartet. The melodic writing centers almost exclusively on the first violin, with the three other instruments in a secondary, accompanying role. None of Haydn\u2019s later innovations are present. And yet, there is an unmistakably idiomatic feel to the music, as though it offered a distant foreshadowing of what was now on the horizon.\n\nAsked what she hoped listeners might take from the performances, Davidson hoped it would broaden the idea of what a string quartet can be \u2014 both in terms of the repertoire and of the Emergence\u2019s sound. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice to sort of push the years back and hear where those sounds were coming out of, and understand that a quartet can make a number of different aesthetics and create a number of different sound worlds just by the style of writing and the setup of the piece. There\u2019s a lot more variety than we\u2019re aware of.\u201d",

        "text": "Big changes are brewing for coffee retailer Blue Bottle. In January, the company raised a steep fundraising round of $25.75 million, following a $20 million round in October 2012. In April, Blue Bottle acquired coffee bean subscription service Tonx, a brand particularly beloved by the tech set.\n\nToday, Blue Bottle announced that the Tonx acquisition paved the way to launch its newly reconfigured subscription service, Blue Bottle at Home. The coffee company is also opening its first caf\u00e9 overseas.\n\nIn a crowded marketplace, Blue Bottle at Home stands apart by delivering its trademark expertly sourced, single origin beans to your doorstep just 24 hours after roasting. Blue Bottle home delivery costs a flat $19 a month, while other boutique coffee roasters, including Chicago\u2019s Intelligentsia and Portland\u2019s Stumptown, offer tiered plans that can be adjusted to ship weekly or monthly. It\u2019s hard to find a major coffee company that doesn\u2019t have a recurring home delivery option. Even global leader Dunkin\u2019 Donuts offers a monthly subscription plan starting at $8.99.\n\nThe slow-drip sales add up. According to market research firm StudyLogic, online sales of coffee, tea, and hot cocoa hit $12.5 billion in 2013, up from nearly $10 billion in 2011. Revamping subscription and online sales platforms is also on trend. In April, for instance, Peet\u2019s hired digital marketing agency Razorfish to overhaul its e-commerce platform, which offers subscriptions for both coffee and tea, at various prices based on the coffee bean or tea leaf.\n\nNik Bauman, Tonx co-founder and now Blue Bottle\u2019s Director of Digital Product, admits that in terms of offering a subscription, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing something completely revolutionary.\u201d Rather, he explains, \u201cWe\u2019re sweating the details.\u201d What type of coffee you want, at what cadence\u2014and in the perfect packaging\u2014should be a top-shelf experience.\n\nThe acquisition was warmly welcomed by Tonx, which needed a jolt of energy to move from savoring a strong digital following toward attempting to become a household name. \u201cJumping over that chasm and getting to real brand recognition in the marketplace\u2014you can\u2019t rush that,\u201d Bauman says. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t enjoy putting money behind the phrase \u2018brand building\u2019.\u201d By aligning with Blue Bottle, Tonx was getting the boost of a proven brand.\n\nBlue Bottle already had a skeletal subscription service. The idea of bringing on a technical partner to optimize the existing system had been percolating for a while. \u201cDavid [Bowman, Blue Bottle\u2019s CFO] and James [Freeman, Blue Bottle's CEO] had been looking at Tonx before I called them,\u201d Bauman says.\n\nFor founders known for obsessing about single origin beans, the blend of the two companies is surprisingly smooth. Blue Bottle is known for high quality control standards, refusing to outsource any offering, even down to its pastries. Freeman says though he greatly admires Tonx, the idea of an acquisition was, for a short time, a major philosophical hurdle. His biggest challenge was understanding that \u201cit\u2019s okay to not make it yourself sometimes,\u201d he says with a chuckle. His team was behind the merger from early on. \u201cSometimes the reason to have people on your team is to listen to them,\u201d he further concedes.\n\nBlue Bottle at Home arrives at a time when, thanks to the ever-expanding subscription economy, you can have everything from beauty samples to exotic foods delivered straight to your door on a recurring basis. But Bauman notes that an off-the-shelf subscription model doesn\u2019t actually fit that many businesses. He warns that simply getting someone to sign up isn\u2019t the goal, and in fact, overselling your product up front is a great way to lose a potential long-term customer. \u201cIf you subscribe to paper towels and you get two bundles of six, you have 12 paper towel rolls sitting around,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nOptimizing the Blue Bottle at Home experience isn\u2019t just about looking at a virtual dashboard, though the engineering team does collect customer data to improve the overall experience. But Bauman notes that a typical Blue Bottle customer wants a delightful but utilitarian experience. Proactively reaching out to customers is a further extension of the thoughtful care Blue Bottle has been known for. \u201cYou have two months to make sure you meet and exceed [the customer\u2019s] expectation,\u201d Bauman adds. \u201cThey want us to have sweat the details, to have crafted things in a way that creates a pleasant and fun experience but not for fun\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition also brews fresh opportunities for brick-and-mortar, with new caf\u00e9s opening next week in Los Angeles and New York City. Blue Bottle\u2019s first caf\u00e9 abroad is slated open in Japan during the first quarter of 2015. \u201c[Tokyo] is not a license.

        "text": "Master of contrast ... Ib Geertsen. Photograph: Rocket Gallery\n\nThe Danish modernist artist Ib Geertsen, who has died aged 90, was one of the originators of the \"Konkret\" movement in postwar Scandinavia. Derived from constructivism, the movement was closely associated with Denmark's social democracy and with major state-sponsored public art commissions. Geertsen, a progressive and a populist, became a committed proponent of the Konkret aesthetic and the universalism with which it was associated.\n\nBorn in Copenhagen, Geertsen grew up in the second city of Aarhus, where he trained as a gardener. His non-academic background and diverse early career reflected one important strand of the Danish modern movement, which was as equally rooted in provincial arts and crafts traditions as it was in the intellectual and bohemian life of the capital.\n\nAs a teenager, Geertsen became interested in the work of the Greenland artist Karale Andreassen, whose output was in the Nordic modern romantic manner. He also sought to emulate C\u00e9zanne's flat compositional structure in his portraits and still life paintings of the late 1930s. Indeed structure and form rather than subject or motif increasingly became Geertsen's central preoccupations.By the early 1940s, by which time Denmark was under German occupation, Geertsen had become increasingly involved in the Danish avant garde, perhaps as a form of resistance to the kitsch academic styles of Nazi art. His growing circle of artist friends were all politically left-leaning and, to varying degrees, involved in the resistance movement. In 1941, he helped the art dealer Thorkild Hansen to arrange a small exhibition of abstract art by Asger Jorn, Egill Jacobsen, Richard Mortensen and others in Aarhus. By 1943, Geertsen's work had also been exhibited by Hansen at his gallery in Copenhagen. As a result, Geertsen moved there and his work quickly developed a vigorous expressionist manner, also favoured at that time by Mortensen, his close friend and mentor.\n\nAlong with his fellow artists Albert Mertz and Richard Winther, Geertsen co-founded the multi-disciplinary neo-Dada Linien II group in 1947. Their first exhibition that year not only featured paintings and sculptures, but also performances and concerts. Thereafter, Geertsen's work became increasingly disciplined and was characterised by bold, flat forms and clearly delineated blocks of bright, contrasting colour.\n\nNew members of Linien II, such as Gunnar Aagaard Andersen and the French constructivist Jean Dewasne, probably influenced Geertsen's shift from expressionism to constructivism. More generally, after Denmark's liberation, the country was swept by a wave of Americanism that affected Danish art, design and architecture on many levels. Thus, notwithstanding Geertsen's claim to work instinctively, his more theoretically minded colleagues were undoubtedly aware of the New York art critic Clement Greenberg's writings on \"medium-specific purity,\" which influenced the international development of constructivist art in the west from the late 1940s onwards.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Geertsen had developed a simplified formal language to use throughout his work, the \"tear drop\" or \"circle-square\" (a circular motif with one corner squared off) becoming a recurring motif, which he intended the public to recognise as his signature. This development coincided with the growth of Denmark's welfare state and with the widespread commissioning of substantial modernist artworks by the government and municipal authorities to adorn nearly all new public buildings and transport infrastructure. As a result, Geertsen's vivid colours and dynamic forms brightened up hospitals, road underpasses, schools and universities.\n\nAt the same time, Geertsen began to produce painted steel sculptures and mobiles which shared the playful abstract language of his paintings and screen prints. His cast-concrete sculptures for children's play areas contained tunnels through which to crawl. He hoped that his work would bring spiritual uplift to passers-by, who would enjoy its formal and aesthetic qualities; there was no mysterious message and what you saw was what you saw.\n\nA charming and intelligent man, Geertsen nonetheless studiously avoided being doctrinaire and sought to engage with as wide an audience as possible, in line with his centre-left political outlook. He planned his canvases by cutting out the various shapes in paper and adjusting them until he achieved the desired arrangement. Then, he drew round the shapes and blocked in the colours without using masking.\n\nGeertsen was married three times. With his third wife, Birthe S\u00f8derberg, whom he married in 1960, he had a daughter, Anne Marete, born in 1964; her death in 2006 came as a great personal blow to Geertsen. Thereafter, he gave up painting and concentrated only on making mobiles and sculptures.\n\nGeertsen remained little known outside Denmark until late in his long career. In February 2009, an exhibition of his work was held for the first time in London, at the Rocket Gallery in Shoreditch, where he showed significant pieces in a variety of media spanning the past half-century. By this point, his health was in decline - yet he attended the opening, charming everybody present.\n\nMeanwhile, a major summer retrospective exhibition, concentrating on Geertsen's sculptures and mobiles, was being planned at the ARoS art museum in Aarhus. On the eve of the private view, he died.\n\nHe is survived by Birthe and by his grandson and granddaughter.\n\n\u2022 Ib Geertsen, artist, born 7 January 1919; died 3 June 2009",

        "text": "With the death of the artist Frederick Gore, aged 95, a link has been lost with the Camden Town school of painting. Gore never knew his father, the painter Spencer Gore, a leading member of the group, who died in 1914 only a few months after Frederick's birth in Richmond, Surrey, but he revered his memory and for many years was a guardian of his reputation. Fred Gore, sometimes patrician and slightly raffish, with a love of street scenes and popular entertainments, was himself rather like a Camden Town artist. Some people think that his style became more akin to his father's as he grew older.\n\nAt Lancing college, West Sussex, Gore was head boy and an athlete, performing well in the public school championships held at the old Stamford Bridge track in south-west London. Corinthianism \u2013 doing better than professionals in a determinedly amateur fashion \u2013 was always a part of his character, sometimes to the bemusement of art school colleagues. At Trinity College, Oxford, which he entered in 1932, officially to read classics, he continued his athletic career. \"I had a scholarship. I did not do any work at Oxford. I drank a good deal and found a rather inappropriate lady of the town, whom I fell for.\"\n\nWhen not otherwise having a good time at Oxford, Gore studied at the Ruskin school of art. Its master was Albert Rutherston, his father's best friend, who led Gore towards art as a career. He eased him out of Oxford and into the Westminster art school in London, and then the Slade. Gore was one of those artists who was so willing a student that he accepted influence from a variety of sources. Camden Town painters, especially Walter Sickert, he could scarcely avoid. His earliest paintings were also influenced by Barnett Freedman, Mark Gertler, Bernard Meninsky and Cedric Morris.\n\nGore had his first show at the Redfern gallery in 1937. He then painted in Greece and exhibited the results in Paris, with a catalogue introduction written by Louis Vauxcelles, the veteran art critic who had coined the expression \"Fauves\". From 1940 to 1946 he served in the army, then returned to Greece and France. He then produced mural-like canvases of dancing peasants and a number of solitary, almost experimental landscapes. A plein-air artist by nature, Gore liked to carry his easel and painting materials to remote mountain sites in the south of France. When he found a place in which he sensed both solitude and danger, he knew he had found his subject.\n\nGore was head of the painting department at St Martin's school of art from 1951 until 1979, during which time he expanded facilities, conducted memorable battles with the renowned sculpture department and employed a succession of unconventional tutors, chief among them Gillian Ayres and Henry Mundy. In fact, his career at St Martin's coincided with the anarchic golden age of British art schools. He encouraged or tolerated eccentricity and believed that \"the pedantic side of art schools is an appalling thing\".\n\nIn almost the next breath, however, Gore could denounce Picasso (in his distinctly upper-class voice) as \"that dreadful fellow who has ruined all our lives\". It was often difficult to know where his allegiances lay. Some of his paintings, especially the landscapes, look like the work of a reborn post-impressionist. Many other canvases depict rock stars such as Ian Dury, whom Gore much admired, or Times Square in New York (painted from a hotel window), and these pictures often have the look of naive or amateur art.\n\nAt one time he was much excited by Jackson Pollock, who \"liberated me from concern with what kind of painting I did\". Gore never imitated Pollock. He simply realised that, like Pollock, he could do as he wished. Although he was not an abstract painter, Gore was a champion of abstraction at a time when, in Britain, non-referential painting was regarded with suspicion. His short but telling book, Abstract Art, published in 1956, praises a number of contemporary London painters for their abstract work and contains a generous description of Pollock's \"action painting\".\n\nGore thought of himself as a competent amateur theologian (his great-uncle was Bishop Charles Gore), and as a scholar. Another short book, Piero della Francesca's The Baptism, appeared in 1969. Gore wrote it to confront Kenneth Clark, who had unwisely attempted to snub him in a meeting and who (Gore believed, perhaps rightly) regarded the early renaissance master as his own intellectual property.\n\nHis ability to speak on equal terms with both establishment grandees and difficult artists made Gore a perfect helmsman of the Royal Academy as it came to terms with the new conditions of the 1980s and 90s. He was the most influential academician never to have been made president, a post he did not seek. He became an associate member in 1964, a full member in 1973, and was chairman of the academy's exhibition committee from 1976 to 1987.\n\nGore organised the academy's jubilee exhibition, British Painting 1952-77. Its selection appears much less peculiar today than it did at the time. Many of the avant-garde and eccentric artists represented soon became academicians, some of them reasoning that an institution with Freddie Gore as its guide might be worth joining.\n\nHe was not only a man who chaired committees. He had many unusual friends, a mysterious connection with the Hell's Angels (\"a rather elderly chapel, I'm afraid\") and until very late in life was a star at any party. This was because of his devotion to Russian folk dancing. Sometimes wearing a top hat, Fred in action was an amazing sight. He said that dancing was as much in his blood as was painting.\n\nHis mother had been a dancer, and in his youth he had frequented the Bal N\u00e8gre nightclub in Paris. His wife Connie had introduced him to flamenco dancing via a Gypsy friend. For technical reasons, which included great leaps and stamps, Russian dancing suited him best. Gore was a prominent member of the Balalaika dance group for more than 30 years. His friends often listened to his explanations of the balalaika (\"a crude gourd, don't you see, made triangular, with three strings of which two have the same percussive element\"). These lessons were often as baffling as his attitudes to art.\n\nHe is survived by Connie and his son and two daughters.\n\n\u2022 Frederick John Pym Gore, painter, born 8 November 1913; died 31 August 2009",

        "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is poised to vote on the most controversial Internet policy proposal in years, after opponents of the plan \u2014 from both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 launched a furious last-minute lobbying campaign to influence the outcome.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote on FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler\u2019s new Open Internet proposal has become a flash point in the intensifying public debate about \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the principle that broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon should treat all Internet traffic equally.\n\nWheeler, a former venture capitalist who\u2019s only been on the job for six months, finds himself squeezed in a vice-like grip between net neutrality advocates and public interest groups, who argue his rules don\u2019t go far enough, and industry giants and their allies on Capitol Hill, who oppose net neutrality regulations altogether.\n\nBoth sides warn that the very future of the Internet \u2014 which has spawned a generation of technological innovation and billions of dollars in economic growth \u2014 hangs in the balance. The fundamental question is whether broadband regulation should move in a direction that treats Internet service more like a utility and less like a premium service.\n\nNet neutrality advocates have been camping out for days in front of the FCC\u2019s office, which has struggled to maintain open phone lines under a torrent of calls. Wheeler, an avowed supporter of Open Internet principles, came out to chat with the protestors on Wednesday morning, and was even photographed wielding a \u201cHonk for the Open Internet\u201d sign.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote wouldn\u2019t enshrine the new rules, it would only approve what\u2019s called a \u201cnotice of proposed rulemaking\u201d (NPRM) making the draft proposal available for public review, and trigger several months of public comment. Wheeler hopes to have the new rules in place by the end of the year. The FCC\u2019s meeting starts at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nNet neutrality advocates want Wheeler and his colleagues to reclassify broadband companies under Title II \u201ccommon carrier\u201d provisions of the Communications Act that have governed traditional phone companies for decades. Such rules would subject the broadband companies to tighter regulation.\n\n\u201cWe urge the FCC to use its clear authority under Title II of the Communications Act to reclassify the transmission component of broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service,\u201d thirty-six U.S. lawmakers wrote in a letter to the FCC on Wednesday. \u201cRecognizing our nation\u2019s communications providers as common carriers under the law is common sense.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest broadband companies strenuously oppose such reclassification, arguing that it would \u201cthreaten new investment in broadband infrastructure and jeopardize the spread of broadband technology across America, holding back Internet speeds and ultimately deepening the digital divide.\u201d\n\n\u201cReclassification of broadband Internet access offerings as Title II \u2014 telecommunications services would impose great costs, allowing unprecedented government micromanagement of all aspects of the Internet economy,\u201d twenty-eight CEOs including Lowell McAdam of Verizon, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Robert Marcus of Time Warner Cable, and Brian Roberts of Comcast, wrote in a letter to the FCC. \u201cUnder Title II, new service offerings, options, and features would be delayed or altogether foregone. Consumers would face less choice, and a less adaptive and responsive Internet.\u201d\n\nWheeler\u2019s plan would reportedly allow broadband providers to strike special deals with Internet companies for preferential treatment \u2014 sometimes called \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d \u2014 in the \u201clast mile\u201d to consumers\u2019 homes. Such Internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d would threaten innovation, net neutrality advocates argue, because they would put Internet startups \u2014 the next YouTube, Skype or Netflix, perhaps \u2014 at a disadvantage compared to deep pocketed media giants.\n\nIn January, a federal court struck down most of the FCC\u2019s 2010 Open Internet order prohibiting broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon from blocking traffic like Skype or Netflix on wired networks or putting them into an Internet \u201cslow lane.\u201d (Comcast is currently the only broadband company bound by the Open Internet order, as a result of an agreement it made with the government as part of its purchase of media giant NBC Universal.)\n\nWheeler\u2019s plan \u2014 which was leaked to the press two weeks ago \u2014 would allow companies to strike paid-prioritization deals as long as they acted in a \u201ccommercially reasonable manner subject to review on a case-by-case basis.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what kind of financial agreement would be considered \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d because Wheeler\u2019s draft proposal hasn\u2019t even been made public.\n\nLast week, more than 100 Internet giants and startups sent a letter to the FCC expressing alarm over Wheeler\u2019s proposed net neutrality rules. In response, Wheeler wrote that he has \u201cmade clear that if someone acts to divide the Internet between \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have nots,\u2019 I will use every power at my disposal to stop it, including Title II. I will not allow some companies to force Internet users into a slow lane so that others with special privileges can have superior service.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of an intense backlash from Internet giants, startups, venture capitalists, public-interest groups and consumers, Wheeler modified his draft proposal to make Title II reclassification a more realistic option, a FCC official told TIME earlier this week. But any proposal that doesn\u2019t include strict safeguards preventing the largest broadband giants from establishing what net neutrality advocates consider to be a \u201ctwo-tiered Internet\u201d is unlikely to quell the firestorm.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 Call him the Freddy Krueger of potential presidential nominees. Liberals, feminists, and plain-old targets of his withering dismissiveness may have thought they destroyed Larry Summers\u2019 shot at the Federal Reserve chairmanship. But he\u2019s back \u2014 haunting their dreams of seeing stately womanhood at the helm of the nation\u2019s money supply.\n\nWhite House leakers tell the Washington Post that Summers is still in the running to succeed outgoing Ben Bernanke \u2014 and, by some accounts, even topping the President\u2019s list. A Summers nomination would shock and defy vocal critics who form the core of Obama\u2019s liberal base and have been pushing Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen. And it\u2019s not just liberal activists: Yellen easily trounced Summers in a Reuters poll of economists asking who should be the next Fed chair.\n\nThe Post and others say Summers remains in the mix largely because of President Obama\u2019s close relationship with, and regard for, the economic adviser who guided a new and uncertain administration through the early dark days of a massive recession. Summers is a believer in big, bold government action in the face of hard times. \u201cCould the stimulus be too big?\u201d he once said to me. \u201cThat\u2019s like asking me if I could lose too much weight.\u201d\n\nObama also owes Summers critical political points. As National Economic Council director, Summers vigorously backed bailing out the auto industry. It was a decision that, in his own words on election day last year, led to a \u201cvery different economy in Ohio and a very different economy in Michigan\u201d \u2014 and a losing battle in both states, he noted, for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nMORE: Jack Lew: The known unknown at the Treasury\n\nIf Summers does win the nomination, watch for the White House to counter a powerful storm of criticism with these talking points:\n\n\u2013 Critics say his support for deregulation in the 1990s \u2014 blocking proposals to regulate derivatives and favoring the elimination of Glass-Steagall \u2014 contributed to the financial crisis. But Summers was long a vocal critic of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, arguably far more important contributors to the collapse. As Summers said at a Harvard Kennedy School panel that I moderated earlier this year: \u201cWhen I hear people talk about public-private partnerships, I reach for my wallet. No one used the term more than Fannie Mae, unless it was Freddie Mac. Massive collaboration, massive disaster.\u201d\n\n(Conservative critics could ask where Summers\u2019 suspicions of public-private partnership were hiding when solar company Solyndra was blowing through half a billion dollars of taxpayer money.)\n\n\u2013 Much speculation has, rightly, centered on what a Summers chairmanship would mean for monetary policy. But a key part of the Fed chair\u2019s job is an ability to foresee crises on the horizon \u2014 something all top regulators dropped the ball on pre-2008. So watch for the White House to position Summers as a (rare) seer of dangers to come. In 2006, he worried about the level of risk-taking with these words: \u201cThe main thing we have to fear is lack of fear itself.\u201d\n\nAnd in November of 2007, four months before the collapse of Bear Stearns, he called on policy makers to \u201cwake up to the dangers of a deepening crisis.\u201d He added: \u201cThree months ago it was reasonable to expect that the subprime credit crisis would be a financially significant event but not one that would threaten the overall pattern of economic growth \u2026 Without stronger policy responses than have been observed to date \u2026 there is the risk that the adverse impacts will be felt for the rest of this decade and beyond.\u201d\n\nMORE: Are we ready for the next meltdown?\n\n\u2013 To concerns that Summers is too pro-business, expect the President to talk about their shared concerns over a widening income gap and decreasing social mobility for average Americans. Our \u201clevel of inequality and social mobility has deteriorated,\u201d Summers told the same Harvard audience earlier this year, calling it \u201cstunning\u201d that the ability of both a rich child and a poor child to go to a good college is smaller than it was 30 years ago.\n\n\u2013 Feminists not only support an historical appointment of Yellen as the first female Fed chief, but also view Summers as sexist, based on his controversial women-in-science remarks as Harvard President and his clashes with fellow Obama economic adviser Christina Romer (In the Post story, Romer questions Summers\u2019 management skills). To counter that perception, the White House will likely call upon Facebook FB Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who counts Summers as a mentor in a career that put her at his side at the World Bank and the Treasury Department. (Another powerful woman Summers supported in her career: Facebook Global Public Policy vice president Marne Levine). Sandberg, author of the post-feminist best-seller Lean In, has already publicly defended Summers on this score.\n\nIf the President Obama does tap Summers, the White House will have to mount a defense that gets him to 60 votes in the Senate \u2014 and for that, he\u2019s still likely to need support from Republicans.",

Still, he adds: \"The Great Recession will mark the millennials for the rest of their lives. It affects your earnings trajectory for the rest of your life.\"\n\nThere is one silver lining for millennials though: baby boomers.

        "text": "If we are to prevent ISIS from teaching us this lesson the hard way, we must acknowledge that we cannot extinguish the fires of fanaticism by force alone. The world must unite behind a holistic drive to discredit the ideology that gives extremists their power, and to restore hope and dignity to those whom they would recruit.\n\nRead MoreCost of US campaign against ISIS is roughly $1 billion\n\nISIS certainly can \u2013 and will \u2013 be defeated militarily by the international coalition that is now assembling and which the UAE is actively supporting. But military containment is only a partial solution. Lasting peace requires three other ingredients: winning the battle of ideas; upgrading weak governance; and supporting grassroots human development.\n\nSuch a solution must begin with concerted international political will. Not a single politician in North America, Europe, Africa, or Asia can afford to ignore events in the Middle East. A globalized threat requires a globalized response. Everyone will feel the heat, because such flames know no borders; indeed, ISIS has recruited members of at least 80 nationalities.\n\nISIS is a barbaric and brutal organization. It represents neither Islam nor humanity's most basic values. Nonetheless, it has emerged, spread, and resisted those who oppose it. What we are fighting is not just a terrorist organization, but the embodiment of a malicious ideology that must be defeated intellectually.\n\nI consider this ideology to be the greatest danger that the world will face in the next decade. Its seeds are growing in Europe, the United States, Asia, and elsewhere. With its twisted religious overtones, this pre-packaged franchise of hate is available for any terrorist group to adopt. It carries the power to mobilize thousands of desperate, vindictive, or angry young people and use them to strike at the foundations of civilization.\n\nRead MoreAlbright looks to Turkey for help in war against ISIS\n\nThe ideology fueling ISIS has much in common with that of Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. What most worries me is that a decade ago, such an ideology was all that Al Qaeda needed to destabilize the world, even from a primitive base in the caves of Afghanistan. Today, under ISIS, adherents have access to technology, finance, a huge land base, and an international jihadist network. Far from being defeated, their ideology of rage and hate has become stricter, more pernicious, and more widespread.\n\nThe destruction of terrorist groups is not enough to bring lasting peace. We must also strike at the root to deprive their dangerous ideology of the power to rise again among people left vulnerable by an environment of hopelessness and desperation. And, on this note, let us be positive.\n\nThe solution has three components. The first is to counter malignant ideas with enlightened thinking, open minds, and an attitude of tolerance and acceptance. This approach arises from our Islamic religion, which calls for peace, honors life, values dignity, promotes human development, and directs us to do good to others.\n\nOnly one thing can stop a suicidal youth who is ready to die for ISIS: a stronger ideology that guides him onto the right path and convinces him that God created us to improve our world, not to destroy it. We can look to our neighbors in Saudi Arabia for their great successes in de-radicalizing many young people through counseling centers and programs. In this battle of minds, it is thinkers and scientists of spiritual and intellectual stature among Muslims who are best placed to lead the charge.\n\nRead MoreISIS airstrikes: Who are the US's Arab allies?\n\nThe second component is support for governments' efforts to create stable institutions that can deliver real services to their people. It should be clear to everyone that the rapid growth of ISIS was fueled by the Syrian and Iraqi governments' failings: the former made war on its own people, and the latter promoted sectarian division. When governments fail to address instability, legitimate grievances, and persistent serious challenges, they create an ideal environment for hateful ideologies to incubate \u2013 and for terrorist organizations to fill the vacuum of legitimacy.\n\nThe final component is to address urgently the black holes in human development that afflict many areas of the Middle East. This is not only an Arab responsibility, but also an international responsibility, because providing grassroots opportunity and a better quality of life for the people of this region is guaranteed to ameliorate our shared problems of instability and conflict. We have a critical need for long-term projects and initiatives to eliminate poverty, improve education and health, build infrastructure, and create economic opportunities. Sustainable development is the most sustainable answer to terrorism.\n\nOur region is home to more than 200 million young people. We have the opportunity to inspire them with hope and to direct their energies toward improving their lives and the lives of those around them. If we fail, we will abandon them to emptiness, unemployment, and the malicious ideologies of terrorism.\n\nEvery day that we take a step toward delivering economic development, creating jobs, and raising standards of living, we undermine the ideologies of fear and hate that feed on hopelessness. We starve terrorist organizations of their reason to exist.\n\nI am optimistic, because I know that the people of the Middle East possess a power of hope and a desire for stability and prosperity that are stronger and more enduring than opportunistic and destructive ideas. There is no power stronger than that of hope for a better life.\n\nCommentary by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai.

If it's something you can consider agreeing to, we can continue to date. If not, we can just be friends,' \" Palm tells PEOPLE of one of his first dates with Kirsten. \"And she signed on with a smile on her face.\"\n\nBorn in Illinois and raised primarily in Southern California, Palm, now 41, was the son of a minister and grew up with a love for aviation and a desire to help people.\n\nAt age 16, Palm says he had a \"life-changing\" experience that inspired him to find a way to combine his two passions.\n\n\"I got the chance to go to Mexico with my church's youth group to build houses for people who were less fortunate,\" he says. \"Being a part of that felt like a godsend. It was confirmation that I needed to use my passion for aviation to serve in a remote area of the world.\"\n\nThree years later, while in college, Palm and a friend took a trip to Papua New Guinea in the southwest Pacific Ocean. They spent five weeks visiting remote islands and living with the tribes.\n\n\"These people were living without the basics,\" Palm says of his 1994 trip. \"They brought us this little boy who had a small cut on his leg that was badly infected. It was something so simple that here in the States we would put a little bit of ointment on and it would be over. But this little boy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that. We used a first aid kit and we tired to fix him up the best we could, but we realized this is a place that needed help.\"\n\n, a medial outreach program that now serves the 500,000 residents of Papua New Guinea's East Sepik Province.\n\nMark Palm in Papau New Guinea.\n\n\"Eighty percent of these people live in remote areas and would have to travel two to five days to reach the one hospital in the province,\" says Palm. \"But [in 2010,] we started operating the area's only seaplane. We deliver medicine and supplies and provide transportation to people in emergency situations.\"\n\nPalm estimates that Samaritan Aviation \u2013 which is funded by donations as well as the government of Papua New Guinea \u2013 has helped save almost 400 lives, many of them mothers and babies.\n\n\"One time we got called to pick up a woman who had passed out during a breech birth. We got a local nurse and flew to pick the mom up, but there wasn't room for her husband to come along with us. He had to take the long way,\" says Palm. \"It took him a few days to reach the town where the hospital is and when he did he went to the morgue assuming that's where he'd find both his baby and his wife but they weren't there.\"\n\n\"They sent him to the hospital where he found his wife and twin babies,\" Palm continues. \"I remember him looking at my wife and basically saying, 'I don't deserve this. I'm a bad person and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve you guys coming over here to save my wife.' That was a picture of grace for us. That is why we do what we do.\"\n\nPalm has dedicated his life to Samaritan Aviation but is quick to acknowledge that he does not do it alone. He spent the first part of last year training a second pilot and has hired a medical director. A second seaplane will be in operation beginning in early 2016 with another pilot moving out soon to help with the workload.\n\n\"That plane is invaluable,\" says Andrew Rankin, a former Sepik program manager with Oxfam in Papua New Guinea, an organization that has helped fund Samaritan Aviation's work. \"Without Mark and his operation, it would be impossible to service the villages in that area. It literally is a life-and-death situation that they are saving people from.\"\n\nKirsten Palm in Papau New Guinea.\n\nPalm is grateful for the support of his board, donors, mentors and fellow pilots, but he is perhaps most thankful that his wife and three kids \u2013 Sierra, 13, Drake, 11, and Nolan, 10 \u2013 have been with him the entire time.\n\n\"I couldn't do this without my wife. She will drive the ambulance from the plane to the hospital and she stays with the patients. She helps feed them and prays with them,\" says Palm. \"And my kids are right there too. They see the needs and they've had the chance to respond to those needs at a young age. I think it's important that they see that things are bigger than themselves. I think that is shaping who they are as people.\"\n\nPalm would love for Samaritan Aviation to expand across the globe, but for now, he's focused on helping the people of the East Sepik Province.\n\n\"The need is so great for right now in Papua New Guinea. If we find other opportunities, we'll look at those. But the priority is helping here before we worry about anywhere else,\" he says. \"It's all about looking outward and saying, 'What are the needs around us and how can we make a difference?' \"",

        "text": "Forty years ago this week, the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach President Richard Nixon. Never comfortable with the media, Nixon made no attempt to hide his true feelings about reporters (especially Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post) or where he thought the blame belonged for his downfall: \"It's the responsibility of the media to look at the president with a microscope, but they go too far when they use a proctoscope.\"\n\nMany U.S. presidents have shared Nixon's exasperation with the press. Theodore Roosevelt coined the term \"muckraker\" during a speech in 1906. He compared investigative reporters to the narrow-minded figure in John Bunyan's 17th-century religious fable, \"The Pilgrim's Progress\": the \"man that could look no way but downwards, with a muckrake in his hand.\"\n\nThe idea of reform-minded journalism existed long before Roosevelt complained about its alleged excesses. The two fathers of modern journalism, Richard Steele and Joseph Addison, started the Spectator in 1711 with the explicit aim of informing, educating, entertaining and reforming British society. The 10th issue had \"Mr. Spectator\" declare: \"I shall endeavor to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit with Morality.\"\n\nThe British press started to flex its political muscles in the 1770s, when the gadfly John Wilkes fought the government for the right to publish parliamentary debates. Wilkes's campaign led to mass marches, riots and even a stint in prison for him. Nevertheless, he succeeded in establishing the freedom of the press to report on politics. Emboldened, the major London newspapers began to regard themselves as the \"fourth estate\"\u2014a power in their own right. The Times of London became known as \"the Thunderer\" after one of its editorials began: \"We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform.\"\n\nWhen the world's first war correspondent, William Howard Russell, came to the U.S. to report on the Civil War, his brand of nonpartisan, investigative journalism irritated many Americans. But in 1871, a mere 10 years later, the U.S. press was going after the corrupt and the vicious with unbridled confidence. Among their first targets were William \"Boss\" Tweed of Tammany Hall and the graft-taking congressmen in the Credit Mobilier railroad scandal.\n\nThe Progressive Era, from the 1890s to the 1920s, was a golden age for crusading journalism, including The Wall Street Journal's 1922 revelation of bribery and collusion among the Harding administration and California oil barons. The first undercover reporter seems to have been Elizabeth Jane Cochrane, writing under the pseudonym Nellie Bly.\n\nIn 1887, Bly feigned madness to have herself committed to the women's insane asylum on New York's Blackwell's Island. After 10 harrowing days in which Bly witnessed incredible scenes of torture, deprivation and psychological cruelty toward the inmates, some of whom weren't mentally ill at all, a lawyer from Bly's paper, the New York World, secured her release. Bly's subsequent report helped to bring sweeping changes to the asylum.\n\nFifteen years later, Ida Tarbell began her groundbreaking expos\u00e9 for McClure's magazine of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly. Tarbell's 1904 book, \"The History of the Standard Oil Company,\" helped result in the company being broken up under the 1911 Sherman Anti-Trust Act. A second Ida, the African-American journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, risked her life to bring the horror of Southern lynch mobs to the world's attention. She became a founding member of the NAACP in 1909.\n\nThe muckrakers haven't always received their due from history. But as Joseph Addison joked, being relegated to yesterday's news is an occupational hazard: \"We are always doing something for posterity, but I would fain see posterity do something for us.\"",

She has learned how to flee for shelter during air strikes and witnessed the tragic deaths that follow. But this summer, she shifted gears to tell a story a little closer to home\u2014in her own backyard in Windom, Minnesota, where she used to take summer jobs as a rock picker.\n\n\u201cIt was super fun and you got a great tan and you got to get dirty,\u201d she says. \u201cI would pack a lunch and hang out on a flatbed trailer connected to a 1950s John Deere tractor with my friends.

The region\u2014the remains of a prehistoric glacial zone\u2014still has rocky deposits in its soil. So, every year before corn harvest, the soil is tilled and everything below comes to the surface, including rocks, which can damage crops and equipment. Having planted their crops ahead of corn season in June, farmers need to get rid of these pesky disturbances.\n\nRock picking is a minimum wage-paying, high-energy job for kids who are out of school for the summer, Potter says. \u201cThey have nothing else to do, and their parents see it as a way to keep them busy.\u201d\n\nPotter\u2019s images capture the rolling cornfields of Murray County, Jackson County and Cottonwood County. They show the day-long process pickers go through. Some farmers are pickier than others about the size of the rocks that need to be removed \u2013 it varies from fist size to arm\u2019s length. Those too large to carry are flagged for others to get later. Many of the rocks are sold for landscaping.\n\nGrowing up in small town Windom, Minnesota, Potter says she was always restless. \u201cI always felt different, out of place,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to distance myself a bit. I\u2019ve always been proud of where I\u2019m from, but I was never satisfied. I wanted to get away from a small town and from Minnesota.\u201d After training as a registered nurse and graduating from Bethel University in 2011, she left for the Middle East. \u201cI went back to Jordan, where I had studied abroad and that was a little too quiet and Yemen was having an election, so I bought a ticket and went,\u201d she says.\n\nNow returning to her hometown, she says she identifies with her native land more than ever before. \u201cThis time, coming back, I see a lot of that in myself, whether I wanted to or not. And I\u2019m proud of where I came from.\u201d Her work is an attempt to make life in a small town in Minnesota a little more relatable. \u201cSome people tell me they thought farms didn\u2019t exist anymore, or they have a very provincial view of what farming is,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope people can see this is one slice of rural America that was important to me at a certain time and is still important to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAlex Potter is a photographer based in the Middle East.\n\nRachel Lowry is a writer and contributor for TIME LightBox.

        "text": "Obamacare has provided health insurance to some 20 million people. But are they any better off?\n\nThis has been the central question as we\u2019ve been watching the complex and expensive health law unfurl. We knew the law was giving people coverage, but information about whether it\u2019s protecting people from debt or helping them become more healthy has been slower to emerge.\n\nA few recent studies suggest that people have become less likely to have medical debt or to postpone care because of cost. They are also more likely to have a regular doctor and to be getting preventive health services like vaccines and cancer screenings. A new study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers another way of looking at the issue. Low-income people in Arkansas and Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid insurance to everyone below a certain income threshold, appear to be healthier than their peers in Texas, which did not expand.\n\nThe study took advantage of what Dr. Benjamin Sommers, an author of the paper and an assistant professor of health policy and economics at Harvard, called \u201ca huge natural experiment.\u201d\n\nIn its 2012 ruling, the Supreme Court made the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion optional for states. The resulting variation in choices makes it much easier to compare what happened in different states and draw conclusions about what effects health insurance coverage might have for the finances and health of Americans.\n\nThe researchers gathered their results by conducting a large telephone survey of low-income residents of the three states. They asked the same questions three times: in 2013, before the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion; at the end of 2014, after it had been in place for a year; and at the end of last year. Then they compared what happened over time, using Texas as a kind of control group to see how much of a difference the Medicaid expansions in the other two states made.\n\nTheir survey found people in Arkansas and Kentucky were nearly 5 percent more likely than their peers in Texas to say they were in excellent health in 2015. And that difference was bigger than it had been the year before.\n\nNo two states are exactly the same, of course. There are many differences between Texas, Arkansas and Kentucky, besides their decisions on this part of the Affordable Care Act. The authors cautioned that their results can\u2019t prove that Medicaid expansion caused people to be healthier.\n\nThere are differences between Arkansas and Kentucky as well. Kentucky expanded Medicaid in a more conventional way, while Arkansas tried an innovative expansion, offering its low-income residents private insurance. But the study found only small differences between the two approaches.\n\nThat finding may be of interest to states that have not expanded yet but are considering it. Louisiana this summer became the 31st state to expand its program, using an approach more like Kentucky\u2019s. And Kentucky\u2019s governor has considered revamping the program there to make it more like Arkansas\u2019s.\n\nIt might sound simple to measure whether people are healthier than they used to be, but it\u2019s actually pretty tough. While tests can tell you whether someone has high cholesterol, say, or high blood pressure, a single test may not tell the whole story. It turns out, however, that if you ask people how healthy they are, they do a pretty good job of telling you. Extensive research shows that people who say they are in poor health really are much more likely to die soon than those who describe their health as good.\n\nThe survey also asked about other subjects. It found that people in the expansion states were more likely to have a doctor and to have a place to go for care. They said they were more likely to have their chronic disease treated, and that they were more likely to have received screening for high cholesterol or high blood sugar, markers for heart disease and diabetes.\n\nOn financial measures, the study was in line with some previous studies, finding that people in Kentucky and Arkansas were less likely to postpone care or avoid taking prescribed drugs because of the cost, and that they were less likely to be struggling with a medical bill.\n\nOn almost all measures in the survey, the size of the difference between Texas and the other states was bigger in 2015 than it was in 2014. That trend makes some sense: Once you get health insurance, it might take a while before you start getting health care, and even longer before you\u2019ll start getting healthier (optimistically assuming that you do). But the trend suggests that we may need to wait some time in evaluating the health law\u2019s effects before we really know how big they are.\n\nA famous experiment of low-income people in Oregon tracked one group that won a lottery to receive Medicaid coverage and another that remained uninsured. That study found that people who got insurance were much more likely than their uninsured peers to describe themselves as having good or excellent health. People who got health insurance in that experiment were also more financially secure. But the experiment did not show big changes in some key physical health measures in people they studied, like blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\nThe Oregon study followed those people only for two years. It\u2019s possible that, given more time, those people might have shown signs of better health. (Or not. That experiment ended, but the Medicaid expansion\u2019s natural experiment will continue for longer and may provide more clarity.)\n\nFor those of us trying to evaluate the law, the slowness of results is frustrating. Still, Tuesday\u2019s study is quick by the standards of academic research. Big government surveys are asking some of the same questions posed by the Harvard researchers, but we\u2019re still waiting for their data from last year. Amy Finkelstein, an economist at M.I.T. and an author on the Oregon work, described the three-state survey as \u201centrepreneurial,\u201d because it gives us an early glimpse at these important questions.\n\nIt will take more time, and more research, to be sure whether the Affordable Care Act really is making Americans healthier and more secure.\n\nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

One business backed by Flybridge, digital marketing firm dataXu, is among a handful of local tech outfits that analysts say will try to go public within the next year. Others include Waltham data-storage company Actifio Inc., Burlington-based software firm Acquia Inc., and cybersecurity companies Bit9 Inc. and Veracode Inc.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time high of 17,279 in mid-September, the Dow Jones industrial average entered a steep dive late last week that bottomed out at 16,117 Thursday. On Friday, the index clawed back to 16,380, though that leaves the Dow slightly down on the year.\n\nAs the next wave of companies consider going public, the experiences of two marquee Boston-area companies that concluded IPOs in the past few weeks don\u2019t offer easy lessons.\n\nShares of Boston-based online home goods retailer Wayfair floundered after a strong opening, sinking as low as 22 percent below its initial $29 price before rallying somewhat Friday. But digital marketer HubSpot has mostly been riding high, its shares remaining well above the IPO price of $25.\n\nSome investors cautioned against drawing conclusions from Wayfair\u2019s and HubSpot\u2019s performances so far.\n\n\u201cIs this is a sneeze, a cold, the flu? No one knows yet,\u201d said Maia Heymann, senior managing director of Cambridge venture capital firm CommonAngels Ventures. \u201cGreat companies that are growing and hitting their plans can get out even in choppy markets.\u201d\n\nThe market turmoil comes amidst a bumper crop of IPOs. According to Renaissance Capital, 316 companies have filed to go public so far this year, compared to 256 in all of 2013.\n\nHeymann and other investors are counseling against panic. They say the recent market dive is unlikely to be a harbinger of a larger collapse, and that a healthy dose of skepticism keeps bubbles from forming. Some investors even use the market turmoil to remind entrepreneurs to make sure their companies are in sound shape.\n\n\u201cWhat this really requires them to do is make sure the fundamentals are there: the numbers, the story, the positioning,\u201d said Sean Dalton, a partner at Highland Capital Partners. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there, this is a chance to slow things down a little bit and make sure you address those deficiencies.\u201d\n\nIn going public, investors said companies must consider factors including how much money they have on hand now, the size of their company, and how well-known their brand is.\n\nLarger, established companies have it easier; they\u2019re less likely to be blown by daily market winds. But for smaller companies, getting IPO timing right can be a life-or-death decision.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller company and your stock goes south on the first day, a lot of shareholders will just dump,\u201d said Ben Howe, chief executive of investment bank America\u2019s Growth Capital. \u201cTo get them back in and committed after you\u2019ve disappointed them like that is really hard.\u201d\n\nInvestors noted that an IPO is an expensive and potentially distracting challenge. Companies must satisfy regulatory requirements, carefully manage shareholder expectations, and spend time on the road schmoozing investment bankers and potential investors. The further along a company is in that process, the more likely it is to complete an IPO, whatever the market conditions.\n\nFor pre-IPO companies that decide to wait, the delays may be especially frustrating because market volatility is often triggered by remote events that have little bearing on their business. \u201cIf you\u2019re the CEO of a private tech company, you can neither control those things or let yourself get too distracted by them,\u2019\u2019 Bussgang said.",

As a native Alabamian and artist, I believe that it is crucially important to recognize and honor the genius of Southern art, including its important and unique contribution to the nation\u2019s artistic and cultural heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe remarkable artists of Gee\u2019s Bend are among those at the vanguard in this sense,\u201d Richardson says. Indeed, despite being made far from traditionally championed urban sites of American design (the town is populated just by a few hundred people, most of whom are descendants of slaves), the quilts are shamelessly modern and hold up with a surprisingly contemporary aesthetic.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t always heralded, discounted like much of the artwork created by African Americans in the south historically. As the New York Times reported in 2007, the quilts made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend were largely ignored until, in the late 1990s, William Arnett, \u201ca white champion of self-taught black artists, began a rescue mission, buying dozens of the quilts and ultimately creating one of the biggest surprise hits in the art world\u2019s recent memory.\u201d Arnett went on to form the Souls Deep Foundation, which is giving the collection named after him to the Met.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s donation also includes 10 works by Thorton Dial, including Out of the Darkness, the Lord Gave Us Light and African Athlete. Dial grew up in a rural Alabama sharecropping family, worked in manufacturing jobs, and has no formal training as an artist. His work uses elements of found objects, painting and sculpture usually attributed to the likes of artists like Jasper Johns. However, as the magazine Arts Atl wrote in 2012, \u201cfound-object assemblage flourished before Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg made the practice famous,\u201d noting that \u201cRauschenberg grew up looking at African-American yard art, castoffs and discards arranged into provocative displays.\u201d That would be the same kind of work Dial would have grown up around, and was making himself, long before Rauschenberg\u2019s work was hung in the museums or galleries of New York.\n\nWhile the donation to the Met is a gem, it is not without controversy. Arnett was sued in 2007 by some of the quilters whose work he purchased, and while the lawsuit was resolved a year later, the relationship brought up \u2013 like so many things in American history \u2013 challenging questions about race, opportunism, and control. As the Times quoted Andrew Dietz, the author of a book about Arnett\u2019s relationship with artists whose work is in the Souls Grown Deep donation: \u201c\u2018When you mix the old South, race, educational and class differences, the subjective value of art, the egos of the art elite and the good old greenback, you\u2019ve got yourself a powder keg ready to blow.\u201d\n\nThe Souls Grown Deep\u2019s powder keg was diffused, even if the bigger issues of race continue to roil American art and expression. The donation will be curated for a show at the Met in the fall of 2016.",

        "text": "Ask many up-and-coming retirees what their biggest fear is, and they\u2019ll say running out of money. Just 18% of workers are very confident that they\u2019ll have enough money for a comfortable retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute\u2019s 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey.\n\nThe insurance industry has heard those worries loud and clear, and they\u2019ve answered with longevity annuities. What are they? Essentially, these are simple deferred annuities that ask you to hand over a lump sum of cash to an insurance company in exchange for a guaranteed income decades down the road.\n\nLongevity annuities aren\u2019t new. But you\u2019ll likely see many more of them after the New Year \u2013 from big names like New York Life, Guardian and Mass Mutual \u2014 now that a new law says they can be purchased inside of 401(k) and IRA plans so long as the account holder begins collecting on the policy by age 85, rather than age 70 \u00bd \u2014 the age when required minimum distributions must begin.\n\nHere\u2019s how this looks in practice. Let\u2019s say you have a $500,000 IRA. Under the rules, you\u2019re allowed to take 25% of that account or $125,000, whichever is less, and buy a longevity annuity. The amount of your paychecks will depend on when you opt to start taking the income; the longer you wait, the lower your life expectancy, so the higher your monthly checks will be. But because you put $125,000 into the annuity, instead of taking required minimum distributions on the full $500,000, they\u2019d be based on the remaining $375,000. If you die before you start receiving income you can structure it so 100% of the value will go to your beneficiaries; even if you\u2019ve turned on the income stream, you can set it up so that the remainder goes to beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cThese annuities have been around for 10 years, but they\u2019ve only really been sold for three and they only represent a little more than 2% of annuity sales. This ruling is going to educate the public on how these products work,\u201d says Stan Haithcock, an annuities expert. Haithcock is a fan of these products for their simplicity. (Variable and index annuities don\u2019t qualify under the new law.) \u201cThis is an easy to understand pension product. I could explain it to a 9-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cMy prediction is that in 5 years, they will be the number one type of annuity in the country.\u201d\n\nShould you take the bait? The downside to these products involves liquidity and flexibility. \u201cYou can\u2019t change your mind and say, \u2018send me all my money back,\u2019\u201d Haithcock says. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason the government put a limitation on what you can put in.\u201d You should also steer clear if you need all of the money you expect to get from RMDs to live on. \u201cThis isn\u2019t for the person who needs more money from their IRA or needs to access a lifetime income stream sooner,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the vast majority of [people] with traditional IRA wealth will be okay with pushing some of these assets.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether you can create an income stream of your own that allows you to maintain more control over your assets.\n\n\u201cIn my practice, I\u2019m employing something along the lines of a bucket strategy, which means there are three buckets of money \u2014 a stock bucket, a bond bucket and a cash bucket. Typically, clients will have two to five years of expected withdrawals in the cash bucket, so you\u2019re creating your own income stream and it\u2019s no different from what the insurance companies are trying to do,\u201d explains New York Certified Financial Planner Bill Losey. The missing element for the DIY approach: guaranteed income. You may do better than you would with an annuity. Then again, you may do worse.\n\nFinally, if you do go down this road, Haithcock says to be wary of agents who try to change the discussion to variable or index products where they\u2019ll get more money. They\u2019ll try to change the conversation. Don\u2019t let them. \u201cThis option was put on the planet for young workers to be able to put money away that is targeted to lifetime income stream,\u201d he says. If today\u2019s retiree fears are indicative of the future, they\u2019ll need it.\n\nArielle O\u2019Shea contributed to this report.",

Facebook\u2019s quarterly profits totaled $701 million, or 25 cents per share, representing a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nOnce again, Facebook FB got a bulk of its revenue from mobile ads as it surpassed analyst expectations of $3.7 billion in revenue.

        "text": "This article is published in partnership with Time.com. The original version can be found here.\n\nLast May, Duke University\u2019s Vice Chancellor for clinical research, Dr. Robert Califf, told an audience of executives that the American system for developing drugs and medical devices was in crisis. Using slides [pdf] developed by Duke\u2019s business school, he said the system was too slow and too expensive, and required disruption and transformation. Towards the end of his talk, he put up a slide that identified a key barrier to change: regulation.\n\nSuch views are not uncommon in industry, academic research and on Capitol Hill, but they are noteworthy coming from Califf because he could soon be America\u2019s top regulator overseeing the safety and efficacy of the country\u2019s drugs and medical devices. Califf is already set to become deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next month. Now sources familiar with the process tell TIME he is on President Barack Obama\u2019s short list to run the agency following this month\u2019s announcement that its long-serving commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, will step down in March.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on pending personnel decisions, but word that Califf is in contention for the top spot at the FDA comes at a key moment. The agency faces potentially dramatic changes this year as Congress prepares to rewrite many of the rules for how drugs and medical devices are reviewed and tested for safety and efficacy. Califf is widely respected in the public and private sectors, but his candidacy is seen by some as a threat to the independence and authority of the FDA, thanks to his views on the need to accelerate change and his deep financial and intellectual ties to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\n\nCaliff says his salary is contractually underwritten in part by several large pharmaceutical companies, including Merck & Co. Inc MRK , Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY , Eli Lilly & Co. LLY and Novartis SA NVSEF . He also receives as much as $100,000 a year in consulting fees from some of those companies, and from others, according to his 2014 conflict of interest disclosure [pdf].\n\nIn an interview with TIME, Califf estimates that less than half of his annual income comes from research money provided by the pharmaceutical industry, though he says he is not certain because he doesn\u2019t tend to distinguish between industry and government research funding. He says he is divesting his holdings in two privately-held pharmaceutical companies he helped get off the ground.\n\nCaliff says such collaboration, not just between industry and academia, but with government, too, is the way of the future. \u201cThe greatest progress almost certainly will be made by breaking out of insular knowledge bases and collaborating across the different sectors,\u201d Califf says. He says there is \u201ca tension which cannot be avoided between regulating an industry and creating the conditions where the industry can thrive, and the FDA\u2019s got to do both.\u201d He says it would be \u201cuseful to have someone [leading the FDA] who understands how companies operate because you\u2019re interacting with them all the time.\u201d\n\nDiana Zuckerman, President of the National Center for Health Research, which advocates for FDA regulatory authority, says such ties \u201cshould be of great concern.\u201d Dr. Califf is \u201ca very accomplished, smart physician who\u2019s been an important name in the field,\u201d Zuckerman says, but his \u201cinterdependent relationships\u201d raise questions about his \u201cobjectivity and distance.\u201d She cites several studies suggesting the medical products industry uses such ties to influence the behavior and decision making of doctors and researchers, even when the scientists don\u2019t realize it.\n\nThe tension over Califf\u2019s collaboration with industry gets to the heart of the future of the FDA at a pivotal moment. While FDA defenders see the collaboration as a threat to its independence, others see close relationships between government, industry and academia as the model for the future. Califf heads a successful and powerful clinical research program, the Duke Translational Medicine Institute, which brings together industry drug researchers, academic scientists and federal regulators to speed drug development and approval. Califf estimates 50-60% of its $320 million in annual research funding comes from industry.\n\nCapitol Hill is considering codifying parts of that collaborative model for the FDA. The powerful Energy and Commerce Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives recently introduced a draft bill called 21st Century Cures, which would loosen the drug approval and post-market oversight process. Califf says because the bill is still in draft it is too early to pass an overall judgment on it but he says, \u201cI support a lot of the concepts in the bill.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee has begun work on its own bill, with committee chairman Lamar Alexander declaring, \u201cIt takes too long and costs too much to develop medical products.\u201d In a report paving the way for his legislation, Alexander concluded the FDA has grown too large, has fallen behind scientific innovation and threatens American leadership in biomedical innovation. Reform efforts in the Senate may be aided by the support of liberals like Elizabeth Warren who back looser regulations on the medical device industry.\n\nThe FDA uses a model for drug testing and oversight largely developed in the early 1960s, with phased trials before drugs and devices are approved for sale to ensure they are safe and effective, and \u201cpost-market\u201d studies afterwards to monitor them. Over time, the agency has come to rely on the medical product industry for more than 60% of its budget for post-market monitoring. Accused of regulatory capture by those who see undue industry influence, the FDA has faced attacks from both sides.\n\nThat means the FDA has few defenders and will rely heavily on its next commissioner to stand up for it in public and on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis is a very dangerous time for the agency,\u201d says Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, \u201cIt\u2019s under fire in a way that is unprecedented in the last 20 years.\u201d\n\nCaliff\u2019s supporters point out that he is among the ten most cited medical authors in America, and that he has spent his career as a clinician helping patients. Regarding the danger of regulators being \u201ccaptured\u201d by their interactions with industry, Califf says, \u201cThe difference between capture and collaboration towards improving human health is a pretty big difference.\u201d\n\nThe White House has set no time frame for its decision on Hamburg\u2019s replacement. It has announced the acting commissioner will be Dr. Stephen Ostroff, a scientist and long-time official at the Health and Human Services department, when she steps down in March.",

        "text": "Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d album. When it was released in 1975, vinyl records ruled supreme, and this particular one would eventually reach platinum sales status sixteen times over.\n\nOh, but how times have changed. Artists who are almost entirely guitar-free top the Billboard charts now, and downloading and streaming seem to be the dominant methods of music consumption. Vinyl did see an increase in sales of more than 50% in 2014, but overall album sales fell by 11% that year, including digital album sales. It all adds up to bad news for a guitar-slinging band that embodies the vinyl era.\n\nDespite this daunting fact, the Led Zeppelin back catalog is in the middle of a deluxe reissue campaign that began in June 2014. All of its albums are in the process of being re-released on vinyl, compact disc and digital download configurations, and so far the group\u2019s first five albums have made their way to music store shelves. Today, \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d gets its turn at bat, and then only two more studio albums remain before the hoards run dry.\n\nThe decision to embark on an extensive reissue campaign comes at a time when compact disc sales declined 15 percent in the past year, according to Billboard. Starbucks SBUX , one of the remaining vestiges of compact disc sales in the U.S., recently announced that it will stop selling them entirely at all of its 21,000 locations in March.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this mean the decision to relaunch the entire catalog is a little dicey?\n\nAs it turns out, no. The group\u2019s 1971 album Led Zeppelin IV was reissued in October 2014 and re-entered the Billboard charts at number seven, just a handful of slots away from Taylor Swift. Clearly, there is still a market out there for this music, and it\u2019s big enough to justify a physical release at a time in history that\u2019s not exactly favorable to that sort of thing.\n\nThose wishing to keep it simple can just buy the remastered album, or they can pay a little extra and get the \u201cdeluxe\u201d edition, supplemented with seven bonus tracks. But for those for whom money is no object, or who simply like to show off, there\u2019s the \u201cSuper Deluxe Edition\u201d boxed set.\n\nA true test of what the market will bear, it contains the album and bonus tracks on compact disc, vinyl and a high-resolution download accessible via a code found on the inside. It also includes a 96-page, LP-sized hardcover book. Altogether, the whole shebang costs approximately $120 and weighs approximately ten pounds, so don\u2019t drop it on your foot.\n\nWho, exactly, is going to buy this thing? Jon Lambert, general manager of the legendary Princeton Record Exchange in Princeton, N.J., told Fortune that based on what he\u2019s observed since the campaign began last year, the super deluxe box sets are indeed selling, albeit in \u201cdrips and drabs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main demographic for the big, boxed items is men between the ages of 30 and 50,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be a little well-heeled to buy the box set.\u201d\n\nHe said that while Super Deluxe Editions of \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d sell somewhat lackadaisically, the mid-priced, single-format configurations have been moving steadily and at a brisk pace. He also added an interesting side note \u2014 those sales are almost entirely driven by young people, whose parents are old enough to have seen Led Zeppelin perform. And despite the vintage format, these kids are \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d buying more vinyl than compact discs, he said.\n\n\u201cLed Zeppelin has transferred generations,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cIt\u2019s still selling. Younger people are still buying those artists. Jack White sells well too, but classic artists are going to sell well, like Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones.\u201d\n\nThere are still two more studio albums left before the Led Zeppelin reissue campaign wraps up. But while the tricked-out Super Deluxe Editions are likely to remain the province of well-to-do baby boomers, customers who are younger and less affluent will likely keep on buying the single-format configuration and keep this music alive for the foreseeable future.",

They'll be ahead of schedule in their rehab and they'll be ready to come back, stronger than ever.\n\nAll have been said of Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer, but when he sat at the podium at the team's headquarters on Thursday -- the first time he has done so since his emotional press conference less than 24 hours after suffering a season-ending torn ACL in Week 10 against the St. Louis Rams -- Palmer was refreshingly free of hyperbole.\n\n\"There's ahead of schedule and then there's professional-athlete ahead of schedule or behind schedule,\" Palmer said. \"That gets kind of blown out of proportion, but I'm going to be ready to rock and roll by the season. I'm definitely going to be ready for (training) camp and shooting to be getting reps in our mandatory mini(camp) and hopefully some of the OTA practices.\"\n\nIt's been 116 days since Palmer suffered the injury, but he is walking without any hint of a limp and has been running for two to three weeks. He is doing squats, leg presses, pulling sleds and is pretty close to resuming a normal workout.\n\nHe said he's in rehab Monday through Friday for about four to five hours, with running and hard agility drills on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, lifting on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and throwing every day.\n\n\"The last month has really been fun against because I'm actually lifting weights and getting ready for 2015,\" he said.\n\nPalmer said the knee injury he suffered in 2005 in Cincinnati -- one he has described as much worse than this one -- helped him know what to expect in this rehab process.\n\n\"A lot more than I expected,\" he said. \"A lot of things come back to you that you had forgotten about.\"\n\nAs anyone would expect, Palmer said it was difficult to watch the team compete in the playoffs without him. He also said he was in a funk for a while and had to apologize to his wife later when he realized all the things that he had missed by being so self-absorbed.\n\n\"We had a date night,\" Palmer said. \"She brought that up, and I quickly changed the subject.\"\n\nIt's unknown how much coach Bruce Arians will allow Palmer to participate in OTAs and minicamp when it really isn't necessary at this point in his career, but it's a safe bet the Cardinals will be conservative and err on the side of caution if there is any doubt about his readiness.\n\nWhile Palmer lamented the loss of Darnell Dockett to the 49ers on Thursday, he also expressed relief that receiver Larry Fitzgerald will be back for two more years. He also anticipates GM Steve Keim being aggressive to improve the roster when free agency begins next week. To that end, Palmer said he agreed to restructure his contract about a month ago to help the team's cap situation and free-agency plans.\n\n\"They've done a good job since Steve and Bruce have been together,\" Palmer said. \"The sky's the limit. My expectations are very high that we're going to get even better next week.\"\n\nFollow Craig Morgan on Twitter",

Its shares are down almost 50% from an all-time high of $97.60 a few months ago.\n\nMichael Kors reported an unexpected 5.8% decline in stores open a year or more, including a 6.7% drop in North America, its biggest market by far. Analysts had been expecting a North American increase in such comparable sales \u2014 a widely accepted measure of a retailer\u2019s health \u2014 of 3%, according to Consensus Metrix.\n\nThe company, long a Wall Street darling, had gotten investors used to seeing 20%+ growth rates in comparable sales since it went public in late 2011. It has been one of the fastest growing brands in recent years, stealing market share away from its handbag rival Coach COH .\n\nTo ride its wave of popularity, Kors has been on a store-opening rampage, adding 121 new stores in the fiscal year that ended March 28 alone, bringing the total to 526. That represents a 30% increase in just one year, and a doubling in just two years. And that doesn\u2019t even include the spaces it has in department stores like Macy\u2019s M and Nordstrom JWN\n\nThe comparable sales declines suggest that Kors\u2019 stores are eating into each others\u2019 sales.\n\nThe Kors strategy contrasts with that of Coach. Seeking to regain the aura of luxury it squandered by having too many new stores and relying too much on outlets, Coach is closing 20% of its North American stores to better focus on locations in key markets and its flagship stores, rather than those in malls. It is also laying off its logo-centric merchandise and focusing on the higher end.\n\nKors, which also sells shoes, eyewear, watches, jewelry and fragrances, has several brands to cater to the high end, the middle market, and discount outlet shoppers, the latter of which could end up cannibalizing its pricier items and damaging its luxury aura. (Again, just look at Coach.)\n\nThat very omnipresence is starting to damage the Kors brand, experts say.\n\nAs Rahul Sharma, founder of London-based Neev Capital and a retail expert, put it in a tweet this morning: \u201cIf your marketing strategy is largely based around [the] \u2018jetset\u2019 loving younger female shopper, remember she can be rather fickle.\u201d\n\nAnd Kors\u2019 problems look set to continue: The company forecast \u201cdouble-digit\u201d percentage decreases in comparable sales this quarter, suggesting things are getting worse for the company, whose operating profit as a percentage of sales is declining.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company\u2019s inventory is up 21.8%, with overall sales rising only 17.8% (Kors\u2019 international push explains much of that growth), suggesting another renewed sales shortfall will mean more sold at clearance, further hurting its profit margins.\n\nAnalysts for years have been saying Kors should slow its growth. But shares rose five-fold from $20 in its IPO in 2011 to $100 in the past year, making it tempting to push ahead.\n\n\u201cThe seductive thing about the Kors-type of \u2018hot\u2019 trajectory is in the initial delight of consumers,\u201d veteran retail expert Robin Lewis said in an April blog post, referring to how accessible the brand is and how much people want it.\n\nThen, \u201call of a sudden, in a nano-split second, the largely young and trend-fickle consumer base wakes up and realizes the brand is slapped on everything and is being worn by everybody, everywhere. And, crash! Wonderful becomes awful. The brand stands for nothing for anybody \u2013 everywhere.\u201d\n\nThat is something that Kors, like Juicy Couture, Tommy Hilfiger, Coach and countless others before it, is now learning.",

In 2002, when the Human Rights Campaign compiled its first Corporate Equality Index tracking company policies of concern to the LGBT community, only 13 large U.S. employers earned a perfect score \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company was one of them. That figure has now climbed to a record 366, out of the 781 companies surveyed.\n\nBut the push for equality in the workplace includes plenty of unfinished business. For example, just one-third of the Fortune 500 earned a \"perfect\" 100-point rating.\n\nRead MoreOpinion: Gay marriage's big benefit is Social Security\n\nWhile it's hard to believe, there are still places in the U.S. where someone can be fired for being \"out\" at work. As business leaders, we have a responsibility to end this kind of discrimination. Even where there are legal protections in place, many people still don't feel safe to be who they are at work. They worry they will be thought less of, won't fit in, or will be passed up for promotion.\n\nThat's not only wrong, it's bad for business. From a human- resources perspective, employee engagement is critical, as it indicates how committed employees are to the success of their company. So it should come as no surprise that, when employees feel they need to cover or hide who they are at work, it undermines their engagement and overall job satisfaction.\n\nCompanies also compete for talent. In the San Francisco Bay Area, where we're headquartered, the competition can be fierce.

For years, our company has provided full benefits for domestic partners.

Because we know we're building relationships that produce economic and social value in our communities. Because we believe companies like PG&E have a responsibility to lead by example.\n\nWe cannot afford to let this historic moment lull us into complacency.

Taking into account income, investments, retirement plans, pensions, etc. as of 2013, a white household's wealth was nearly 13 times higher than a minority household's \u2014 and that gap is growing! To put this in more tangible terms: From 2010 to 2013, the median wealth of white households increased from $138,600 to $141,900, or increased by 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, the median wealth of black households fell 33.7 percent, from $16,600 in 2010 to $11,000 in 2013. These are numbers I might expect to see in Third World countries, but not in the world's most thriving democracy. When put into the larger societal context, it's no surprise that racial tension exists in midst of this tumultuous economic conditions.\n\nRead More Obama to Expand Overtime Pay to Nearly 5 Million Workers\n\nWhat can we do to help close the wealth gap and create equal financial opportunities for minority Americans? We can focus on fair capitalism while investing in improving educational opportunities for our lower-income citizens. Providing free admission to trade schools and community colleges in order to build a more educated workforce is a great way to bridge that gap. With increased education comes more access to middle- and upper-management jobs, which can encourage investment and retirement savings for struggling minorities. A Tennessee initiative (Drive to 55) offers free education to all resident adults at any of its 27 state institutions. This is having positive impacts on the Tennessee economy and even presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has recently proposed a bill titled The College for All Act in an effort to make free education a nation-wide phenomenon.\n\nCapitalism is the only solution to our wealth inequalities in America. Fair and just practices of capitalism while maintaining principles of social empowerment don't happen by chance, half-measures or handouts. The byproducts of fair capitalism are competition, accountability and opportunity. Unfortunately, some of our nation's entitlement programs are not allies to capitalism. The problems with many of our welfare programs, which are aimed to assist much of our lower-income citizens, is not the program itself, but rather the lack of capitalistic ideals within them.\n\nRead MoreConsumer spending rises most in nearly six years\n\nReceiving public assistance should be a safety net that helps people get back on their feet \u2014 not a lifestyle. Welfare-recipient programs should include and mandate educational programs and job training. If anyone fails to comply with these government-funded programs, then they should lose some or all of their entitlement. These ideals may come across as a bit harsh, but tax money should be used to empower people if they are physically and mentally able to work. This is accountability. Once this is accomplished, it would hopefully directly lead to people becoming more competitive in the workplace.\n\nAs long as such a disproportionate number of our minorities are living in poverty, we will continue to see the inequality that provokes acts of discrimination and racism. If we really want to reach a post-racism America, we need to start closing this wealth gap and using fair capitalist ideals to focus on opportunities for EVERY American. This takes a solution based approach that may require states, municipalities, and local governments to redefine their history and design creative solutions.\n\nCommentary by Jack Brewer, a former NFL safety who played for the Vikings, Giants, Eagles and Cardinals.

        "text": "More recently, though, we've seen the rise of new commerce models, many of which are not only sustainable in the short term, but also will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years. Their growth is driven largely by the advent of mobile and the proliferation of social media, making it easier to acquire customers than ever before. Users can tell their networks about new companies or products in real time, providing lower customer-acquisition costs if the experience is special or the pain alleviated is substantial. Buyers and sellers are also connected more efficiently than ever before as mobile becomes a magic wand for marketplaces. This not only opens up new markets that weren't previously available, but also allows entrepreneurs to expose opaque ones that had previously been dominated by incumbents.\n\nStart-ups have been executing on several models that we find exciting:\n\nMembership commerce: These companies offer customers a yearly subscription for a fixed price and in return customers get to shop at heavily discounted prices. In the offline world, this was a model made popular by Costco, but leveraging economies of scale on the Internet allows startups to offer even more heavily discounted prices. Popular companies in the space range from Jet.com, which offers club price savings on a wide catalog of goods competing with Amazon, to Thrive Market, a company that marries healthy and organic products with heavy discounts (think Whole Foods meets Costco).\n\nRead MoreSilicon Valley goes after Wall Street in financial services technology\n\nSubscription commerce: This category has been around longer than membership commerce, but companies in the space continue to flourish. According to Retention Science, an e-commerce marketing platform, subscription-commerce customers are more likely to make a repeat purchase and have a higher average number of orders in a 12-month period than traditional retailers and flash sale companies. Some companies in the space include Dollar Shave Club and Harrys (razors), Trunk Club (men's clothing), Stich Fix (women's clothing), Birchbox (beauty), Lola (tampons) and Barkbox (products for your dog). By offering a product each month to consumers, there is monthly recurring revenue with this model that makes for a strong business, provided there is value being delivered every month.\n\nDirect to consumer: Many of these companies have been born out of the \"black box\" of traditional industry whereas legacy companies had significant margin due to industry monopolies and other dynamics that kept prices high unless you were willing to sacrifice quality. Warby Parker is the most notable of these companies. Warby's key innovation was the disintermediation of incumbents which gave them the ability to pass the savings to the customer. But others in the space include The Honest Company (bath & body care), Casper (mattresses), Cotopaxi (outdoor gear), Stowaway (cosmetics), Away (luggage), Harrys (razors), Campaign (furniture), Greats (sneakers), Bonobos (clothing), Naja (bras), and Everlane (clothing). Building a brand is not easy task, but modern commerce, social, and media has leveled the playing field for emerging companies.\n\nPeer-to-Peer: This model has been around for a long time, beginning with eBay and Craigslist, but both companies have left certain categories open for innovation. By owning the entire stack including logistics, quality control and photography, startups have been able to provide a better customer experience than their predecessors. Poshmark (women's fashion), Move Loot (furniture), Threadflip (women's clothes), The RealReal (luxury), ReBagg (handbags), Slang (sneakers), Grailed (menswear), TrueFacet (watches), 1st Dibs (rare objects), and ThredUP (all fashion) are all companies operating in this space. More recently, this model has also gone further upstream with companies like OpenDoor (homes) and Beepi (cars). eBay still controls much of this market, but time will tell whether or not these companies will take a large portion of the pie.\n\nRental commerce: This category was opened up by Rent the Runway but there are other interesting companies in the space as well. The Black Tux provides tuxedo rentals online, Le Tote offers women's garments and accessories on a monthly basis, and Eleven James provides luxury watch rentals for men. This category can be more limiting, as quality control is more difficult and the use case doesn't span a wide variety of categories; nonetheless, existing companies in the space have seen strong growth and traction.\n\nRead More Value retailers to post better earnings: Analyst\n\nAs you can see, it's an exciting time to be investing in commerce companies. As the barrier to entry for these companies is reduced, more and more interesting companies and models will be born. In the midst of this sea of new companies and models, it can often be difficult to discern which will be winners.\n\nOne of the key things that we look for when investing in these companies is the potential strength of the brand. The most successful commerce companies have been able to build a strong brand that resonates with their customers. These \"lifestyle\" brands include the Honest Company, Gilt, and Warby Parker, which all have distinct brand identities. People that shop at the Honest Company care about their children and the environment deeply. Gilt customers are aspirational, wanting to live a more glamorous lifestyle in the mold of GQ. Warby Parker has built glamorous showrooms with more foot traffic than just about any other store with the exception of the Apple Store.\n\nRead MoreOut with luxury retail, in with off-price: Analyst\n\nYet, it's important take heed of a recent shift in ecommerce toward opening up select, strategic bricks-and-mortar locations. Rent the Runway, Birchbox, and Warby Parker have all established physical locations in response to requests from their customers. After all, with ecommerce conversion rates no higher than about 5 percent, these companies have found a way to activate the other 95 percent of their traffic. While it is not an effective strategy for all ecommerce retailers, establishing tactical offline channels has proven successful for a handful of the winners. After all, humans are the end users and we don't usually think about offline or online strategy but rather that we want what we want when we want it.\n\nCommentary by David Hirsch, co-founder and partner of Metamorphic Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm in New York City.

The investor has claimed PetSmart\u2019s returns to shareholders have badly lagged its peers, and thus believes a sale would offer a better return to shareholders rather than allow current management to run the business.\n\nBut PetSmart, which didn\u2019t immediately comment on Jana\u2019s latest statement, has signaled it doesn\u2019t agree with Jana\u2019s view. PetSmart earlier this month said it was \u201creviewing\u201d ways of changing its capital structure with a focus on returning capital to shareholders.\n\nThe pet industry is a large and sprawling market worth an estimated $55.5 billion, according to the American Pet Products Association. And PetSmart can court many U.S. consumers with its products as a significant majority of U.S. households own a pet. PetSmart has reported higher sales and net income in recent years, though net sales and same-store sales growth for the latest fiscal year ended February 2 were at the slowest pace in the past four years. Results also weakened in the fiscal first quarter of this year, with same-store sales falling 0.6% as the number of transactions decreased. The company faces many challenges as e-commerce competitors pop up and discount and warehouse clubs are among the retailers that sell pet supplies.\n\nJana believes PetSmart\u2019s board \u201cbears ultimate responsibility\u201d for a failure to develop a strong e-commerce presence and moved slowly to build more smaller format stores. Other areas of concern involving pricing and a failure to work with vendors to develop new products, Jana has said. Meanwhile, other investors seem to agree with Jana\u2019s thesis. Shortly after the activist investor disclosed a stake in PetSmart, Longview Asset Management \u2014 whose clients own about 9% of PetSmart\u2019s shares \u2014 recommended the company\u2019s board consider a sale.",

        "text": "Consumer Reports recommends following these seven spending rules to avoid breaking the bank this holiday season:\n\n1. Thou shalt manage receipts. You might need them for proof of purchase for warranties or to make a return. Have a designated place to unload paper receipts after a day of shopping, such as an envelope in a kitchen drawer. For online purchases, save receipts and confirmation e-mails in a computer folder. If you give gift receipts, tell recipients the value, so they get a fair exchange. If you give a gift card, provide the receipt. It will be needed to replace a lost or stolen card.\n\n2. Thou shalt use credit cards. Credit cards provide top fraud protection, and if your credit card is a rewards card, you get rebates and other goodies. Be strategic. Some cards offer extra points or cash back at different times. For instance, from October through December, the Chase Freedom card offers 5 percent back on up to $1,500 in purchases from Amazon.com, Zappos.com, and select department stores.\n\n3. Thou shalt keep track of rebates. Plan carefully if you\u2019re counting on rebates on anything you give as a gift. You\u2019ll probably need to submit the UPC symbol, which could be a problem if the recipient takes or destroys the packaging. If you apply for the rebate before you give the gift, you risk losing your right to return the item. Figure out what you need to do ahead of time.\n\nMake a list of rebate-eligible gifts and filing deadlines. For example, to obtain a $30 Visa prepaid card after purchasing a Kitchen Aid Diamond blender, you must buy the product by Dec. 31 and send the completed rebate form, UPC code, and a copy of the receipt by Jan. 31.\n\n4. Thou shalt not take on debt. Make a budget and stick to it. Don\u2019t be enticed by retailer special offers that provide no-interest financing for a year or more. There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be able to repay all you owe by the deadline. If you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to pay back the interest that has accrued during the \u201cinterest free\u201d period.\n\n5. Thou shalt not fall victim to the hype. Just because it\u2019s Black Friday or an item is 50 percent off doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a top deal. In a 2011 study, a price prediction website found that more than a quarter of TVs and cameras recommended by Consumer Reports were at least 5 percent cheaper after Black Friday weekend. Don\u2019t assume you get the best deals by buying at a particular time or event.\n\n6. Thou shalt not become a target. Avoid theft by withdrawing cash only from ATMs in public places or inside your bank. Avoid giving your e-mail address or phone number to walk-in stores unless you welcome incessant marketing. Check out as a guest when shopping online. If the online retailer asks you to check a box indicating you want them to retain your credit card info, don\u2019t do it. Investigate retailers you\u2019re unfamiliar with by searching the Web and looking for a Better Business Bureau reports. Read sites\u2019 privacy policies and terms of service.\n\n7. Thou shalt not give gift cards. Though federal gift card protections have improved, gift cards remain a hassle. Store cards can be used only at the issuing retailer and might be nonrefundable if they\u2019re lost or stolen, as with Red Lobster and Olive Garden gift cards. Bank cards usually have fees. Simon Mall Visa gift cards cost $5.95 to purchase and charge $2.95 monthly if a balance remains after 13 months. What\u2019s wrong with cash?",

Shares of HP, which plans to split into two companies later this year, took a beating in after-hours trading. Here are the key points of Tuesday\u2019s quarterly earnings report.\n\nWhat you need to know: HP\u2019s first-quarter revenue of $26.8 billion was down from the $28.2 billion the company posted during the same period last year. The tech giant\u2019s sales came up short of the $27.4 billion that analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters. HP\u2019s profits fell nearly 4% to $1.4 billion, or 75 cents per share.\n\nHP said it overcame problems from the strengthening U.S. dollar overseas in the most recent quarter, adding that its first-quarter revenue was down just 2% when exchange rate fluctuations were taken into consideration. But the company also offered a disappointing forecast for the current quarter, warning that currency changes could have \u201ca significant impact\u201d on those upcoming results.\n\nHP\u2019s shares HPQ fell nearly 7% in after-hours trading following the disappointing earnings report. The company\u2019s stock price is up just 2% since November, when HP reported a fourth-quarter sales decline after its first quarterly sales gain \u2014 during the third quarter \u2014 in roughly four years.\n\nThe big number: Sales for HP\u2019s business services unit fell 11% in the fourth quarter, to $4.9 billion, which contributed to the company\u2019s disappointing performance overall. Meanwhile, sales were flat for both the PC business and its Enterprise Group, which includes cloud computing.\n\nSales in HP\u2019s desktop PC business, which accounts for about 30% total revenue, declined 10% after showing some improvement in 2014. Sales of laptops improved 9% to make up the bulk of that business.\n\nOverall, the PC and printing businesses saw sales decline 1.8%, to $14.1 billion. HP said in September the PC and printing businesses would split off into one company while its corporate hardware and services businesses would go into another.\n\nWhat you might have missed: Many analysts hope that HP\u2019s earnings call with CEO Meg Whitman Tuesday evening will provide more details about the pending split \u2014 including how, exactly, the company plans to divvy up its cash and debt between the two new companies. HP did include $80 million in separation costs in its first-quarter earnings report, as well as another $146 million in restructuring charges.\n\nWhitman also said in a statement that her ongoing turnaround plan for HP, which she has said will be completed by 2016, \u201cremains on track.\u201d",

        "text": "Peter Doig Tate Britain, London SW1, until 27 April\n\nThe Peter Doig retrospective now filling several galleries at Tate Britain is easily the most enthralling show in town. Its achievement is to mystify even as it compels. Doig's paintings have always been singular - narcotic, yet intensely stimulating, beautiful yet way out on a limb - and they seem to grow more original and mesmerising by the year.\n\nA perpetual outsider, born in Scotland in 1959 but raised in Canada, then an expatriate in London and now Trinidad, Doig didn't show much until he was 30. But if he was a late starter, a few years older than the YBA generation with whom he studied, he survived the manic star-making of the Nineties by constantly deepening his art and the early paintings set the scene for the future. Frequently snowbound - ski-slopes, icy forests, deep drifts settling on the canvas or arriving like hale in twinkling spatters - they often included the lone figures that have come to symbolise his work.\n\nA boy on a frozen pond studies his reflection in the mauve-rippled surface, the paint - flecked, scribbled, stained, perilously thin - as unstable as the ice. A hooded figure in a mountain landscape turns his back to us, apparently sketching something we can't see but ominous as the dwarf in Don't Look Now. A man by the river's edge at twilight, the car headlights on behind him as if he might yet return to reality, is either mesmerised by the weird phosphorescence on the water or about to do away with himself.\n\nAt another bend in the river drifts the canoe Doig has painted over and again like some deathless Raft of Medusa. A very early craft, unmanned, appears on an inky expanse that holds the reflection of the Milky Way with the eerie brightness of a basalt mirror. Another, becalmed on a stretch of burning blue, carries a bearded man who could as easily be Charles Manson or the Ancient Mariner, time having stopped like this vessel without oars; the picture is called 100 Years Ago. And out in the beating heat of the West Indian bay, palm trees all around, five spectral figures float away into the future. Or is it the past? One of them looks strangely like the young Paul McCartney.\n\nEvery scene suggests an id\u00e9e fixe, some sight or experience perpetually trapped in the mind that can never be exorcised. Doig's gift is for making these memories seem not just his own, but the viewer's as well, as if we, too, could not forget these peculiar moments in films, novels or scenes skimmed from life with a camera that keep flashing back on the mind's eye.\n\nThe slow and distanced trance that characterises Doig's art comes in part from his use of the camera. Stills and snapshots and even album covers (the bearded man started out as a member of the Allman Brothers) form an aide-m\u00e9moire, a departure point.\n\nBut the memories - not necessarily his own in the first place, and chosen with exceptional instinct for the universal - are obscured, overlaid, blended, corroded, lost and found again, quite altered, in the paint. You can see that happening, both literally and metaphorically, as figures on a shoreline darken into shadows behind flurries of snow accumulating on the canvas like aerosol graffiti, or in a vast diptych showing hundreds of skiers on the slopes. The people are melting into the snow, itself deliquescing into a pink twilight as if the sky had overwhelmed the earth below.\n\nDoig holds back the oblivion, every time, with a strong depictive touch. A painting that looks on the verge of abstraction will be held together with precise description - the puckering of water, the piebald dappling of sunshine, a striation of reeds along a riverbank that looks like a drawing catching fire: just enough to keep the scene plausibly real, before releasing it into the dreamy wilds. And they are quite wild, his paintings, veering between enchantment and fear. Who is this man who turns to meet your gaze with a dying pelican in his hand? Where is this wall apparently studded with jewels at which two costumed figures stand sentry beneath a performance of the Northern Lights? How did the little girl in the white pyjamas climb so high in that midnight tree? Doig seeks to fix in your mind whatever haunted his from the wondrous strangeness of the visible world.\n\nBut he never lets you forget the strangeness of picturing itself - that a painting, unlike a photograph, is never really still and, in his case, quite the reverse. The whole surface of a Doig is a micro-life of incidents - focus pulls, jumps in scale, skittering-scattering brushmarks, encrusted impasto, veiled blurs and cross-fades, the leaching and streaking of paint, abrupt discontinuities between psychedelic colours and severe monochromes that seem to belong only to the world of painting.\n\nLately, it's been suggested, the paint is taking over altogether and it might seem so when you consider the apparently empty expanse of an enormous canvas like Untitled 2006. But look closer into the wash of paint, thin as watercolour, and you'll see a figure high up a palm tree, a bird soaring across the pulsating lilac light and, as your eyes adjust, the spectral trace of an interloper: a stranger in paradise.\n\nIf his art was always a bit trippy, reamed out with visions, it now approaches the hallucinatory: winged figures, hot shores, the canoe vanishing into the pale horizon. But Doig's style, by contrast, gets more disciplined by the year. His art is becoming grander and more formal with the decades, his latest paintings composed as distinctively as anything by Bonnard or Matisse.\n\nThere are no false notes, the great scale is perfectly judged to hold all the perceptual incidents and maintain the balance between narrative and image. For in the end, no matter how much they invite interpretation, propose a backstory or riddle with the viewer's sense of mystery, Doig's paintings are about mood and atmosphere above all else. His great gift is for altering our state of mind through the mind's eye, for getting out of this world by inventing another through painting.",

Likewise, the new Los Angeles city rule will not apply to the L.A.-area municipalities of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Burbank and Santa Monica.\n\nThere are also other exemptions to the new law, which will be phased in starting July 1, 2015, at hotels with more than 300 rooms, and on July 1, 2016, at hotels with at least 150 rooms. Hotel owners can argue for a one-year exemption if an audit shows it would cause bankruptcy or worker layoffs in excess of 20 percent or an overall hours reduction of 30 percent. The council also called for a study to determine whether historic hotels should also be exempt.\n\nEarlier versions of the ordinance would have applied to hotels with as few as 100 rooms, and then 125 rooms. The final version that came out of committee Monday put forth the phased-in 300-room and 150-room plan. \"It's diminished quite a bit,\" to the point that the raises may apply to maybe only 6,000 people, Amano said.\n\nRead MoreDo tips perpetuate unfair wages for workers?\n\nStill, supporters have argued that a $15.37-an-hour wage will make a big difference to those employees who get it. \"That's about the minimum you could be paid and not have to rely on public assistance\" in the city, Leigh Shelton, spokeswoman for the UNITE HERE hotel workers union in Los Angeles, told CNBC earlier this month.\n\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association, which represents hotel owners, chains, and suppliers, has pledged to fight wage hikes like these, which it has dubbed an \"extreme minimum wage.\"\n\nRead MoreThe real problem with raising the minimum wage\n\nThe hotel industry has said it's exploring its legal options over the new minimum wage, but Paul Sonn, the general counsel at the National Employment Law Project wage advocacy group, said they're not likely to win since the 2008 airport-area law was already upheld by the California Supreme Court.\n\nSome have argued that the hotels are fair game because they receive government subsidies and can pass along needed increase to non-locals. \"Hotels are both uniquely subsidized and uniquely taxed,\" states a report to the council from the Economic Roundtable. \"Cities have long recognized the need to stimulate tourism and have supported hotels in order to achieve that goal, for example, by building convention centers, which are often loss leaders, supporting marketing through convention and visitors bureaus and by directly subsidizing the construction of new hotels or the renovation of existing hotels. Many of Los Angeles's hotels have been built with such supports over the years.\"\n\nSince Wednesday's 12-3 vote in Los Angeles was not unanimous, the same council members will reconsider the matter Oct. 1, but the approval is likely to be just a formality since only a simple majority of eight is required for passage.",

        "text": "For a number of years, Zogby International has been asking people if they consider themselves a member of the Investor Class. Thirty-eight percent of a November 2008 online sample of more than 24,000 voters so identified themselves, a number that shows how big an impact the stock and bond markets have on average citizens.\n\nWe have a detailed profile of the people who perceive themselves as investors, telling us both who they are and what they believe. Since we don\u2019t set any criteria for the Investor Class, we are measuring a state of mind.\n\nAmong people who don\u2019t see themselves as belonging to the Investor Class, 58% do own a 401K. Technically, they are investors. They just don\u2019t see that as who they are, and probably don\u2019t factor those considerations into how they look at the world.\n\nBecause they represent millions of people, those 38% who identify as investors are a varied group. Many are what I call the Invisible Investor Next Door, people with limited portfolios whose goals include maintaining their lifestyle, having a secure retirement and saving for their children\u2019s educations.\n\nNo matter their wealth or goals, there are differences in the demographics and beliefs of folks who do and do not identify as investors. But there are also many similarities.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the data from our large November poll to compare the two groups, first for demographics. Those who identify with the Investor Class are more likely than noninvestors to:\n\n\u2013Be married (70% vs. 55%) \u2013Have a valid passport (65% vs. 42%) \u2013Be a current or former gun owner (49% vs. 38%) \u2013Own a home worth more than $250,000 (50% vs. 30%) \u2013Have a family income of more than $100,000 (41% vs. 16%) \u2013Be male (53% vs. 43%) \u2013Be white (79% vs. 70%) \u2013Have a college degree (56% vs. 38%) \u2013Say they are white-collar workers (64% vs. 41%)\n\nThose are all differences that would, I believe, be expected. However, the statistical differences we see are not so great as to establish a stereotypical investor.\n\nFor example, 59% of self-identified investors have household incomes below $100,000 and 44% don\u2019t have a college degree. Blue-collar workers make up 15% of the Investor Class, a number that becomes more impressive when you consider that the total percentage of blue collars in this online sample is only 21%.\n\nThere is no significant difference on matters such as religion, whether they live in urban, suburban or rural areas, union membership, or even how often they shop at Wal-Mart. As for race, African-Americans and Hispanics combined make up 15% of the Investor Class, which isn\u2019t so far off their representation in the nation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at belief differences. In our November poll, the Investor Class is more likely than noninvestors to:\n\n\u2013Say they are political conservatives (41% to 26%) \u2013Have voted for John McCain (57% to 39%) \u2013Believe they and their families can achieve the American dream (81% to 58%) \u2013Believe that affirmative action programs reward some at the expense of others (69% to 56%)\n\nHere is data from a Zogby Interactive poll conducted Jan. 22-26, 2009 (sample 3,672), and Jan. 30-Feb. 2 (sample 4,565), where we found the Investor Class is more likely than noninvestors to:\n\n\u2013Rate President Obama\u2019s job performance as only fair or poor (37% to 26%) \u2013Say the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction (55% to 40%) \u2013Rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good (53% to 30%) \u2013Feel very or fairly secure in their current job (72% to 61%) \u2013Blame government for the current recession (54% to 40%).\n\nThe main takes here are that the Investor Class is more politically conservative and optimistic. But there are again caveats. Like the entire sample in our November survey, a plurality of the Investor Class (42%) call themselves moderates, which is only three points less than noninvestors. Let\u2019s also remember that this is an exercise in self-identification, and there are plenty of liberals who closely monitor their 401K accounts, but might recoil at thinking of themselves as part of an Investor Class.\n\nAs for optimism, there are significant spreads for belief in the American Dream and for rating their personal financial situation. However, another question in our late January poll shows both the Investor Class and others as having tepid confidence that their children will have a better life than they have had. For the Investor Class, 54% are very or fairly confident, compared with 49% for everyone else.\n\nWe at Zogby International have had a fascination with this group for nearly a decade for several reasons. First, we are constantly looking for new ways to cluster the American people into groups that help explain who we are and how we behave. Second, demographics is not always destiny. How we identify ourselves can serve as a better barometer of how we vote and shop than religion, income or gender.\n\nThus, while Democrats may certainly be in the ascendancy after the 2008 election, there may still be an appeal down the road for the \u201cownership society.\u201d There is a significant pocket of Americans who are inclined toward conservative values based on how they see their world and from where they see their world: Namely, their investment portfolios, regardless of how big or small the investments may be.\n\nThis is what makes polling\u2013and my life\u2013so much fun and, dare I say, unpredictable.\n\nJohn Zogby is president and CEO of Zogby International and the author of The Way We\u2019ll Be: The Zogby Report on the Transformation of the American Dream.\n\nComments are turned off for this post.",

But in order to really drive success, we must move beyond \u2018group think\u2019 and focus on how we\u2019re going to establish a killer team that doesn\u2019t shy away from bumps in the road.\n\nHand over the leadership reigns The most unproductive meetings are those where there are too many strongly opinionated leaders, with no one individual willing to take charge, drown out the noise and set a path forward. Often the success of the team is about getting beyond the circular discussions (we\u2019ve all been a part of them!) and taking action. This requires handing over the reigns to someone hungry and not afraid to make quick, hard decisions and keep the team moving.\n\nSee also: 3 misconceptions about leading a successful team\n\nSet aggressive goals I\u2019ve learned that a key reason for employee turnover is boredom. If you put individuals in one position for too long, they will eventually feel \u2018stuck\u2019 and are more easily lured by new opportunities, especially the millennial generation. It\u2019s important to work with each person to set aggressive yet realistic goals for growth, and arm employees with a hungry team willing to achieve them. If employees are encouraged to be part of a team that sets tough targets they will fell stimulated, challenged, and part of something important.\n\nEmpower your teams to own it Once aggressive goals have been established teams need to own what they sign up for. This means driving projects that produce results, giving tough love when necessary and speaking up when there are issues. When each member of the team feels personally invested in the goal they are working to achieve, amazing things are possible.\n\nRead all answers to the MPW Insider question: How do you build a strong team?\n\nHow to build a strong team without micromanaging by Sally Blount, Dean of Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nHere\u2019s the secret to getting better employees by Julia Hartz, co-founder and president of Eventbrite.",

        "text": "\"I'm not here to make friends.\"\n\nThere's a reason people on reality TV insist that they're not looking for friendship. That's because so many friendships\n\nIn any social situation, whether you're slaving away in your office cubicle or painstakingly sculpting clay ashtrays at summer camp, you inevitably bond with the people around you. When you're on a TV show, removed from your real-life friends and family, you can't help but define yourself by your relationships with your fellow cast members. You have to repeatedly remind yourself that these people aren't in your life forever, that they're just transient bit players in the heroic story of You.\n\nBeing forced to exclaim \"I'm not here to make friends\" is basically an acknowledgment that you\n\nThe first person to ever utter those words on television, as Spencer pointed out last night, is actually our tribemate, Kelly Wiglesworth. It's a phrase that has unique resonance in\n\n, a game based on building alliances. When you're freezing and starving together in the wilderness, you simply can't build voting blocks purely on cold-blooded strategic calculation. You vote with the people you trust. As I said last night in the episode (can I quote myself? Is that weird?): \"Strategy is based on emotion. You've got to build real bonds in order to build real alliances.\"\n\nto make friends to succeed on\n\nAbi-Maria Gomes would disagree. Abi is definitively\n\nAbi seems completely incapable of extending sympathy to anybody but herself. When Woo shares an emotional story about how his mother barely survived a heart transplant, inspiring his\n\njourney, Abi tries to trump his victimhood.\n\nOh your mother was sick? Well my grandmother\n\n. And I also lost an aunt. And by the way, I had an injured knee.\n\nAbi needs a monopoly on the tribe's attention. If everything's not all about Abi, how does she even know she exists?\n\nWhen nobody supports her campaign for Victim-in-Chief, Abi adopts the same tactic as every other floundering candidate \u2013 she goes negative. Abi accuses Woo of being emotionally manipulative. If that's not the pot calling the kettle manipulative, I don't know what is.\n\nYou have to give Tasha so much credit for the way she placates Abi. You can see the conscious effort it takes for Tasha to stop her eyes from rolling all the way back inside her skull.\n\nSpencer, on the other hand,\n\nhere to make friends. Whether he's boating or he's voting, all Spencer wants is to connect. Spencer in some ways is Abi's emotional opposite. Where Abi can't control her overflowing id, Spencer is self-consciously emotional. He's like\n\n, a robot who just wants to be a real boy.\n\nI can attest that Spencer was extremely emotionally open at camp. He often talked about his girlfriend, his family and his personal aspirations.\n\nBut how deep should your friendships be? It's a delicate balance. For myself, I was consciously avoiding becoming too intimate with my tribemates. Before the season began, I spoke often with Cochran about how he kept his game in\n\nfrom being too personal. Cochran trumped Dawn at the end when jury members felt personally betrayed by Dawn but only strategically outplayed by Cochran.\n\nCochran told me that he would confine his conversation to game talk. People never felt deeply bonded to him \u2013 and therefore, never deeply wounded by him. You can make friends without becoming soul mates.\n\nThere's probably no right answer to the \"right\" amount of emotive. So much of the game depends on the people you're with and the situations in which you find yourself. A winning philosophy one season could spell disaster on another.\n\nWhile Spencer was connecting, Monica was plotting.\n\nI think Monica came into\n\nwith the intention to play hard. Her major flaw on her first season was that she coasted the first half of the game, and only really strategically came awake in time to get voted out by Russell Hantz.\n\nseason is that, by fixating so exclusively on a player's single game-losing flaw, it can cause you to overcorrect.\n\ncan be as slow as it can be fast, and Monica was going 90 mph in a school zone. We were gifted by the\n\ngods with a solid tribe majority on Bayon. Why mess it up?\n\nBut Monica was transparently scheme-y. She told Kimmi that she wanted a girl's alliance, not realizing that Kimmi was close with Jeremy and me. Monica also came to me and suggested a \"big move\" \u2013 which could only in context mean voting out Jeremy \u2013 without realizing that he and I had a budding bromance.\n\nInitially I was hesitant to vote for Monica. My biggest fear was that I thought we were due for another tribe swap. I was terrified that I would end up on a tribe with Savage and Joe and be blamed for betraying Bayon. Savage would never believe that steadfast Jeremy or loyal Kimmi could have turned on one of our own.\n\nI was somewhat placated by the fact that Monica had always been at the bottom of the Bayon hierarchy. But I \"joked\" with Jeremy that if there were a swap, and we were separated, he had better yell over to Savage that I was a decent human being.\n\nFurthermore, Spencer was too good an ally to vote out, and even Wiglesworth seemed a part of our cohesive new Bayon unit. Monica could be a greater danger down the road.\n\nWhat would have happened if Timbira had voted out Erinn Lobdell before the merge, or if Galu took out Shambo? The entire tribe would have benefitted from eliminating the weakest link.\n\nDisloyal numbers don't just hurt you; they help your opponent. In that way, they're like own goals at immunity challenges. (Check out this\n\nwhere I discuss my epic challenge blunder.)\n\nThe Fishy this week goes to the Bayon 3:Jeremy, Kimmi, and (\n\n) me. One of the major setbacks that dominant tribes often face is they never have the chance to vote out their flippers.\n\nMy only reservation with the vote was that we didn't tell Wigles or Spencer what we were doing. Jeremy was adamant about keeping them in the dark; he wanted to keep them nervous and fearful. And keeping people in the dark is the safest way to ensure that nothing goes wrong.\n\nBut Tribal Council is the one place you have on\n\nto prove trust to each other. If we missed an opportunity to build trust with our new tribemates \u2013 how could we truly make new friends?\n\nairs Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on CBS.",

Consider two events this week where judges and regulators got it right, and made critical decisions that will benefit both companies and consumers in the long run.\n\nThe first was a thunderbolt decision in which a unanimous appeals court in New York ruled the U.S. government can\u2019t use a domestic warrant to force Microsoft to turn over emails stored on servers in Ireland. The ruling underscores, like never before, how American courts are growing concerned with due process when it comes to data, and are demanding Congress modernize out-of-date privacy laws.\n\nIn any case, the decision is also a coup for Microsoft, which went out on a legal limb in the case, and won support in court from its rivals across the cloud and tech industries.\n\nThe other piece of good news is that the European Commission formally blessed the Privacy Shield deal that will let companies move data back and forth between the U.S. and the European Union. The pact was far from a sure thing, and the passing of the deal averts a regulatory Armageddon in which American cloud companies like Facebook and Amazon could have been forced out of Europe because of their data-handling policies.\n\nTaken together, the events reflect a growing awareness that cloud computing is now central to our social and economic lives, and that government authorities see a need to create legal structures to help it thrive.\n\nJeff John Roberts is a writer at Fortune.

While Fortune could not immediately reach a spokesperson for Oprah Winfrey, CNNMoney reported that a representative for the star said the Avon rumor is \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nAvon\u2019s sales and profit have been hit for years by a combination of woes: an exodus of its Avon Ladies sales representatives as its direct selling model struggles to adapt to modern realities, a strong dollar hurting sales overseas, and intense competition in emerging markets like Brazil and Russia.\n\nShares have been on a roller coaster all year. Last spring, the Wall Street Journal reported the company was looking to sell its North American business, giving shares a bump. Last week they jumped after a Citigroup research note suggested the worst might be behind Avon. Its market cap is now $1.64 billion, compared to $24 billion at its all time peak in 2004.\n\nWinfrey recently took a 10% stake in Weight Watchers for $43 million, which sent shares up 90% when it was announced. And the former talk show host, famous in part for her weight struggles, became an official participant in the weight-loss program.\n\nThe logic is less obvious with makeup and beauty products, especially given Avon\u2019s dire straits. And it\u2019s hard to imagine Winfrey getting hands-on in a fast declining business that many consider to be beyond repair. Avon\u2019s North American sales are less than half their 2007 levels, and its sales reps\u2014without whom Avon can\u2019t sell\u2014are leaving in droves: Last quarter, their number fell 13%, continuing a years long decline.\n\nLittle relief is in sight: Wall Street analysts expect total Avon revenues to fall 5.3% to $6.78 billion. (In 2011, they hit an all-time high of $11.3 billion.) Avon is set to update Wall Street in January on its plan to finally revive the company after countless turnaround attempts.\n\nAvon shareholders are still smarting from its rejection in 2012 of a $10 billion offer from Coty COTY , and they\u2019re so hungry for news of a lifeline that shares jump on rumors, whether or not they\u2019re true: In June they soared when a Bulgarian man made a bogus takeover offer to profit on the stock\u2019s rise.",

It\u2019s exciting.\n\nWhat is the first thing you do when you arrive?\n\nHave a gin and tonic on the terrace of our home nearby. Judy [his wife, the presenter Judy Finnigan] and I have a home located between Vence and the village of Saint-Paul de Vence.

It\u2019s in the heart of the old town and they do the best wood-fired pizzas.

There\u2019s a little bread shop, just off the roundabout that takes you to Vence, that\u2019s good for a coffee. I don\u2019t think it has a name.\n\nWhere would you send a first-time visitor?\n\nTo the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence (4 93 58 03 26; vence.fr/la-chapelle-du-rosaire-chef-d) , Matisse\u2019s last great work. I remember going with Judy about five or six years ago and was blown away by it, from the colours of the stained-glass windows to the simple drawings, particularly of the Madonna holding Christ in her arms. It moved me to tears because it spoke so eloquently of maternal love.\n\nAlso see the galleries in and around Vence, where you can find wonderful, inexpensive art.\n\nThe Fondation Maeght (4 93 32 81 63; fondation-maeght.com) on the outskirts of Vence has huge sculptures and all sorts of paintings. It has a nice space with green lawns, fountains and a shaded area. Also visit the beautiful Vence Cathedral, which has a real stillness about it.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to speak French. Even if it\u2019s really bad, people in Vence appreciate it. They won\u2019t be snobby and will correct you in a nice way if you get it wrong.\n\nIf you\u2019re using Vence as a base to explore further afield, don\u2019t be seduced by St Tropez. I strongly recommend you don\u2019t go near it in the summer, when it can take hours to get in and out, and frankly there\u2019s not much to see.\n\nThe winding, bougainvillea-lined streets of Vence (Alamy)\n\nWhat should I bring home?\n\nSomething from the antiques market in the square which is on from time to time and some excellent Provencal ros\u00e9 in the supermarket.\n\nAnywhere that\u2019s not your kind of town?\n\nFunchal in Madeira.

For investors, that lack of transparency is something of a hazard.\n\nNow Equidate, a market for trading shares of private companies, plans to lift the veil on some of that information. The company, based in San Francisco, said on Monday that it would make a host of data about private companies free and open to the public, drawing from corporate filings that include the prices that investors have paid to invest in the companies. Equidate also plans to release tools that shareholders can use to calculate the value of their private-company stock holdings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving away this data to help create a more robust market and to give stakeholders like employees, investors and other shareholders a better way to understand the value of their stock,\u201d said Sohail Prasad, a co-founder of Equidate.\n\nThe lack of transparency around private companies, along with a scarcity of shares, has kept the market for start-up stocks fairly small. About $750 million of private shares are actively listed for sale on the Equidate marketplace. By comparison, the total public stock market in the United States includes trillions of dollars of shares.\n\nTo buoy the market for private-company shares, a handful of start-ups have worked to increase transparency and liquidity. Apart from Equidate, the start-up eShares lets privately held companies electronically issue and manage their shares so that investors know who owns what piece of the company at any given time.\n\nWhile information about private companies does exist, it is typically fragmented or hard to find in corporate filings without paying thousands of dollars a year to data-service companies. With Equidate\u2019s new data service and tools, investors can easily see what the current share price of a private company like Lyft might be on the Equidate marketplace and compare it with the price that venture investors and other institutions paid in the past.\n\n\u201cFor the last few years, a lot of companies raised money without having to share much data,\u201d said Semil Shah, an investor with Haystack Fund, a venture capital firm. \u201cThings have swung in the other direction.\u201d\n\nMr. Shah said that nearly everything about the private markets is opaque, including what information is shared between companies and their potential venture investors, and even between the venture firms and the investors whose money they manage. While the lack of disclosure can help entrepreneurs by giving them time to build businesses without scrutiny and can help venture investors negotiate more favorable deals, it can also increase risks for investors who may not fully understand what they are buying, he said.\n\nRegulators are also taking a closer look at the marketplaces for trading private-company stock, which are generally known as secondary markets. Mary Jo White, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a March speech that in the past, private-company secondary markets were rife with issues including conflicts of interest and fraud.\n\n\u201cThese issues stemmed, in part, from the fact that secondary-market investors did not have access to accurate information concerning the value of the companies in which they were investing,\u201d Ms. White said.\n\nAn S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on Equidate.\n\nMr. Prasad says Equidate, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by a group of technology investors, has been working with regulators since 2014. In January, Equidate bought a regulated broker-dealer, which means that the deals made on Equidate must comply with securities rules and have some investor protection and disclosure.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on July 26, 2016, on page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Shining a Light on Hard-to-See Private Start-Ups.

Instead, she was greeted by teenagers and young children with their parents, who filled the small store to enjoy cake and chocolate frogs (a treat among wizards).\n\n\u201cLook at all the young kids in here,\u201d Ms. Stelter said, standing beside boxes of \u201cCursed Child.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in here for a book that\u2019s in print and on paper, not on an electric device. Once they read like that, they\u2019ll read for life.\u201d\n\nMany fans happily brought family members who were not old enough \u2014 or even born yet \u2014 for the celebrations of the original series.\n\nIn Atlanta, Erin Whitlock, 24, brought her 12-year-old brother Liam to a Barnes & Noble in the Edgewood neighborhood.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as big a fan as I am, and it\u2019s just really cool to be here tonight because he gets to experience what I grew up with,\u201d Ms. Whitlock said, noting that her brother visits Ms. Rowling\u2019s website Pottermore, where she regularly publishes new stories. \u201cThe wizarding world doesn\u2019t stop with the books. It goes with your imagination.\u201d\n\nJillEllyn Riley, 48, a writer and editor who lives in Cobble Hill, perused the novels at BookCourt with her sons, ages 13 and 19, who did not seem to mind the spectacle of their mother dressed as Sybil Trelawney, a professor at Hogwarts. Ms. Riley said she hosted monthly Harry Potter club meetings in the neighborhood with her younger son.\n\n\u201cWe came here to BookCourt for Book 7, all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cMy 13-year-old was 3, and I knew that later he would read the books and wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the midnight releases, but I knew he\u2019d know he had been there once.\u201d\n\nAubrey Nolan, 25, who planned the evening at BookCourt, said she wanted to keep the activities family friendly. All around her, children sipped cream soda floats they passed off as butterbeer and decorated wands with paint, sequins and string. Others had mug shots taken that resembled the wizards imprisoned at Azkaban.\n\nBookstores around the country embraced the theme, too, with Books of Wonder in Manhattan offering photos with owls (like Harry\u2019s Hedwig) and the Charles Deering Library at Northwestern University outside Chicago refereeing a Quidditch match, a sport played in the series.\n\nAt the Elliott Bay Book Company in Seattle, nearly 250 people showed up for what was billed as a Hogwarts reunion. And members of the Seattle Shakesbeerience performed the first few scenes from the play with Patrick Lennon \u2014 who said the group\u2019s motto is \u201cscript in one hand, drink in the other\u201d \u2014 as Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the group that aged along with Harry,\u201d Mr. Lennon, 30, said. \u201cOne of the actresses says she\u2019ll probably be crying through it. I might too.\u201d\n\nFor some, nothing was more important than getting their hands on the newest edition, even if it meant waiting alone or interrupting a vacation.\n\nAnnie Grandidge and Travis Dicks, tourists from New Castle, Australia, spent two and a half hours in line at the Barnes & Noble on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. And Ashley Johnson, 32, the actress who played Chrissy Seaver in the sitcom \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d recently moved to Brooklyn to work on NBC\u2019s \u201cBlindspot.\" She showed up at BookCourt by herself, knowing she would easily make friends with other Potter fans.\n\n\u201cI was a little angry that I didn\u2019t read these as I was growing up,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cI found them in my mid-20s and I never got to go wait in line for the original books, so to be a part of that I felt like I needed to go do it. We don\u2019t get to do this with a lot of things with how fast the world moves, and to wait in line for a book at midnight feels really special.\u201d\n\nMargaret Piraino, 24, dressed as Nymphadora Tonks, a half-blood witch, complete with rainbow hair and Potter-themed jewelry, attended the BookCourt party with her girlfriend, Laurel Detkin, a fellow Potter enthusiast. But this time was different.\n\n\u201cI grew up with Harry Potter and it\u2019s been my entire life, and my dad would go to Barnes & Noble with me every time there was a new release,\u201d Ms. Piraino, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said. \u201cAnd this year, my dad died in January and it\u2019s the first time I had to go on my own.\u201d\n\nIn Seattle, Dylan Blanford, 13, donned a long black robe and a yellow tie as a member of Hufflepuff, one of the four houses at Hogwarts, and said he was jealous that he was not at parties for the previous Harry Potter books. He started reading the books at age 5.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited because there\u2019s still this little 6-year-old jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry! Harry!\u2019 And there\u2019s also this 13-year-old jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry! Harry!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited because it\u2019s not the end, forever, you know?\u201d\n\nCorrection: July 31, 2016 An earlier version of a photo caption in the accompanying slide show reversed the positions of Katelynn Kenney and Liane Pippin.

        "text": "Over the past five years, the entrepreneur has rolled out Nip + Fab, which caters to the mass market. The company has doubled its revenues year-on-year and will turn over \u00a315m in the year to March 2014.\n\nPart of Rodial\u2019s allure is the brand\u2019s eye-catching product names. \u201cSome of our products sound scary,\u201d admits Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cWe have Snake Serum, Dragon\u2019s Blood and Bee Venom. They are all very safe but we like to play with the names of our ingredients to create a talking point.\u201d\n\nProducts start at \u00a319 up to \u00a3375 for Bee Venom 24 Carat Gold Serum.\n\nThe company\u2019s love affair with edgy names began with Snake Serum, launched in 2010. \u201cWhen a snake bites you, it paralyses the muscles,\u201d explains Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cThe main ingredient in our Serum is a synthetic venom, called syn-ake, which performs the same way as viper venom.\u201d\n\nSnake Serum was unveiled with great fanfare. Adverts featured a black viper coiling around the products; Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham were rumoured to be fans and sales skyrocketed.\n\n\u201cThere was the occasional person who didn\u2019t like the product because they hated snakes but, mostly, it caused a lot of excitement,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cSo we thought, 'What shall we do next?\u2019 \u201d\n\nDragon\u2019s Blood is a bright red resin from a tree native to the Canary Islands and Morocco. The sap has been used for medicinal purposes since the times of the Roman Empire. \u201cIt helps to take down redness and irritation and I loved the name,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis.\n\nThe skin plumping products are marketed as an alternative to dermal fillers, the so-called \u201cliquid facelift\u201d. \u201cWe added peptides and hyaluronic acid to make it really high tech and now Dragon\u2019s Blood is our bestselling range.\u201d\n\nBee Venom completed the animal-themed range. \u201cLots of customers were asking for it,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cWe took bee venom and the latest stem cell technology to develop a range for more mature skin.\u201d\n\nThe business has made other bold moves in recent years. In 2012, the Nip + Fab brand launched a product called Tummy Fix.\n\nAccording to the e-commerce site\u2019s analysis, 40pc of the people buying the product were men. This convinced Ms Hatzistefanis to start researching the market for men\u2019s skincare.\n\n\u201cWomen in London spend about \u00a31,500 a year on skincare,\u201d she says. \u201cMen in London spend \u00a31,100 \u2013 it\u2019s not that far off.\u201d\n\nThe Nip + Man range launched in May 2013. Products include Manotox, the men\u2019s alternative to Botox, the Bicep Fix and the Ab Fix, with Gemmoslim to battle the bulge.\n\nNip + Man currently represents just 5pc of the company\u2019s turnover, compared with Rodial, which has 55pc, and Nip + Fab with 40pc. \u201cBut it\u2019s growing fast,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis.\n\nThere has been one wrinkle in the firm\u2019s growth trajectory, however. \u201cA couple of years ago there was a big issue with a plastic surgeon who talked to a newspaper and said that our products didn\u2019t do what they promised and could be harmful,\u201d says Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cThat was very shocking.\u201d\n\nRodial\u2019s lawyers sent a letter to the surgeon asking him to show evidence to back up his claims. A media storm ensued. \u201cPeople said that we were threatening the plastic surgeon for expressing his opinion. The media called us bullies. Our integrity as a business was in question. Whenever we tried to clarify things, we couldn\u2019t make it right. It was a really dark time.\u201d\n\nIt took four months for the situation to blow over. Sales remained stable throughout but Rodial\u2019s relationships with its customer base were sorely tested.\n\nToday, the business is thriving. The products remain a firm favourite of celebrity make-up artists for the likes of Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga, helping to generate positive press for the brand.\n\nThe company is expanding its presence in department stores such as Harrods by introducing its own beauty counters. TV shopping is another growth area and airport sales are booming. Bestsellers, or \u201cclassics\u201d, are a rarity, with customers demanding a continuous stream of new products.\n\n\u201cBeauty has become more like fashion,\u201d explains Ms Hatzistefanis. \u201cYou used to launch a range and then maybe add one product a season. Now, the customer expects something new every six to eight weeks.\u201d\n\nAs new lines are introduced, poorly performing products are phased out. This is a \u201cbrutal\u201d process, Ms Hatzistefanis admits.\n\nA new range called Super Acids, described as an alternative to chemical peels, is due to hit the shops this month, to be followed by a make-up range in September.\n\nAfter 14 years, Ms Hatzistefanis, who owns 100pc of the business with her husband, still enjoys the cut and thrust of the beauty industry. She has no plans to sell up any time soon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much you can achieve with a skincare product now,\u201d she says. \u201cJust imagine what we\u2019re going to be able to do in 10 years time.\u201d",

        "text": "Ana\u00efs Mitchell wanted to keep it simple. In four years, she has released a trio of thematically rich albums, which in their pure inventiveness and musical diversity form a stunning creative hot streak. She has done this with help from a growing cast of collaborators culled from the world of Americana and contemporary folk. But for her latest effort, she wanted to strip it right back to the source.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming of musical age, I was really into the coffeehouse scene and Dar Williams and Ani DiFranco, and all those characters were touring solo at the beginning and I would always be disappointed when they finally started having a budget to have drums and bass and stuff,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cAnd of course, as soon as I could afford a band, I had one, too. But I always wanted to just make a record of the songs as they were written.\u201d\n\nSo this month saw the low-key release of \u201cxoa,\u201d which plays as part autobiography and part love letter to Mitchell\u2019s fans. Featuring the artist on guitar and vocals, unaccompanied, it\u2019s composed of newly recorded versions of songs from throughout her career \u2014 notably, including some tunes whose lead vocals were sung by guest artists on the original versions \u2014 plus a few that haven\u2019t been heard before. Selections like \u201cOur Lady of the Underground,\u201d \u201cYoung Man in America,\u201d and \u201cYou Are Forgiven,\u201d heard in these unadorned renditions, should act as catnip to Mitchell\u2019s fans.\n\n\u201cIt really is more of a homespun effort,\u201d she says, \u201cfor people who are already familiar with the music.\u201d The sound isn\u2019t entirely dissimilar from her earliest work, but the record stands alone as a purely solo effort.\n\nAs the Vermont native speaks, she\u2019s in the cafe at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland. (Spotting Pete Seeger\u2019s banjo was a highlight, she says.) In the background of the phone call, her 1-year-old daughter contributes a few wordless comments to the conversation. Ramona\u2019s birth, her mom says, helped trigger Mitchell\u2019s current exercise in artistic introspection.\n\nIt\u2019s a long tour, and after her show at Club Passim in Cambridge on Monday, Mitchell will carry on with more than two-dozen dates in Europe. This is her first extended solo excursion after spending much of last year touring with New York-based musician Jefferson Hamer behind their album of reconfigured English and Scottish folk songs.\n\nBefore that, she had traveled with a band to focus on material from \u201cYoung Man in America,\u201d her darkly ruminative concept album inspired by her father and grandfather. And she\u2019s spent much of her time in the past eight years refining \u201cHadestown,\u201d her folk-operatic retelling of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, having released a staggeringly good all-star studio incarnation in 2010. (Mitchell was in residence at Dartmouth College this past August, further developing the show in tandem with New York Theatre Workshop.)\n\nMitchell\u2019s last two records were produced by Gary Paczosa, an in-demand, Nashville-based engineer and producer who has worked on a dozen albums with Alison Krauss, plus others by Dolly Parton, Chris Thile, and Gillian Welch.\n\nSeveral artists with whom he was working told him he needed to hear \u201cHadestown,\u201d Paczosa says. He put the CD on in his studio, planning to listen to one song and then rush out the door to another commitment. \u201cWe sat and listened to the entire record. We didn\u2019t move,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019m rarely that captivated.\u201d\n\nMitchell says she has no particular interest in writing concept albums \u2014 sometimes things just work out that way.\n\n\u201cI think it just happens that songs come in and they bring along a couple friends, or a couple of cousins,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they may all seem to be chipping away at the same block, but it just happens to be the stuff that's going through your heart and your head at that time.\u201d\n\nWith the most recent addition to the family, she and her husband moved back to Vermont from Brooklyn, where they had spent a few years. She has begun a graduate program in creative writing at Goddard College, pursued remotely through independent study. She\u2019s been listening to a lot of operas and musicals, and wants to sharpen her skills to write another staged production.\n\nShe says the new album and current tour are part of the process before \u201cmoving ahead into the new era.\u201d\n\nWhat does the new era have in store?\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s that I\u2019m rolling around in a van, and trying to do an MFA program, and trying to jog in the parking lot of the hotel with Ramona in a stroller,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to go to bed immediately after the gig, rather than having a bohemian evening afterwards.\u201d",

It believes its patent-pending SQL relational database technology\u2014built completely from scratch\u2014can accommodate more types of business data than legacy offerings from the likes of Teradata TDC or big data management platforms building on Hadoop. \u201cCustomers do have existing solutions, but they\u2019re not satisfied. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re entering a market where people are happy with their current solutions,\u201d Muglia says.\n\nRather than requiring customers to install its technology on site, Snowflake is offering it as a service. Businesses pay for how much data they are storing and by the number of hours it takes to analytics queries against their information. The most direct competitor is Redshift from Amazon Web Services . The company claims its approach costs 90% less than investing in the hardware and software necessary to build on on-site data warehouse.\n\nSnowflake was founded two years ago by a team of engineers who between them hold more than 120 patents in databases and data management technologies: Oracle ORCL veterans Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes, and Dutch computer scientist Marcin Zukowski.

The original article can be found here.\n\nTwo Palestinians stormed a Jerusalem synagogue on Tuesday, attacking worshippers praying inside with knives, axes and guns, and killing four people before they were killed in a shootout with police, officials said.\n\nThe attack, the deadliest in Jerusalem in years, is bound to ratchet up fears of sustained violence in the city, already on edge amid soaring tensions over a contested holy site.\n\nThree of the victims held dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship and the fourth man was a British-Israeli national, police said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Israel will \u201crespond harshly\u201d to the attack, describing it as a \u201ccruel murder of Jews who came to pray and were killed by despicable murderers.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke to Netanyahu after the assault and denounced it as an \u201cact of pure terror and senseless brutality and violence.\u201d\n\nIsraeli police called it a terrorist attack and said the two Palestinian assailants were cousins from east Jerusalem. It was not immediately known if they were affiliated with any group. Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack but stopped short of claiming responsibility.\n\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said six people were also wounded in the attack, including two police officers. Four of the wounded were reported in serious condition. He said police were searching the area for other suspects.\n\nAssociated Press footage from the scene showed the synagogue, in Jerusalem\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Har Nof neighborhood, surrounded by police and rescue workers following the attack.\n\nWounded worshippers were being assisted by paramedics and a bloodied butcher\u2019s knife lay near the scene of the attack.\n\n\u201cI tried to escape. The man with the knife approached me. There was a chair and table between us \u2026 my prayer shawl got caught. I left it there and escaped,\u201d Yossi, who was praying at the synagogue at the time of the attack, told Israeli Channel 2 TV. He declined to give his last name.\n\nA photo in Israeli media from inside the synagogue showed what appeared to be a body on the floor draped in a prayer shawl, with blood smattered nearby.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Luba Samri said the attackers were Palestinians from east Jerusalem, which has been the scene of relentless clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in recent months.\n\nJerusalem itself has seen a spate of attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. At least six people have been killed in the city, the West Bank and Tel Aviv in recent weeks, prior to Tuesday\u2019s casualties.\n\nJerusalem residents have already been fearful of what appeared to be lone wolf attacks using cars or knives against pedestrians. But Tuesday\u2019s synagogue attack harkens back to the gruesome attacks during the Palestinian uprising of the last decade.\n\nIsrael\u2019s police chief said Tuesday\u2019s attack was likely not organized by militant groups, similar to other recent incidents, making it more difficult for security forces to prevent the violence.\n\n\u201cThese are individuals that decide to do horrible acts. It\u2019s very hard to know ahead of time about every such incident,\u201d Yohanan Danino told reporters at the scene.\n\nTensions appeared to have been somewhat defused last week following a meeting between Netanyahu, Kerry and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II in Amman. The meeting was an attempt to restore calm after months of violent confrontations surrounding a sacred shrine holy to both Jews and Muslims.\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians said then they would take steps to reduce tensions that might lead to an escalation.\n\nIn his statement, Netanyahu blamed the violence on incitement by both Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and said the international community ignores the incitement.\n\nKerry blamed the attack on Palestinian calls for \u201cdays of rage,\u201d and said Palestinian leaders must take serious steps to refrain from such incitement. He also urged Palestinian leaders to condemn the attack \u201cin the most powerful terms.\u201d\n\nHamas\u2019 statement praised the synagogue attack, saying it was a \u201cresponse to continued Israeli crimes, the killing, desecrating al-Aqsa (mosque),\u201d a reference to a recent incident at the holy site.\n\nMuch of the recent violence stems from tensions surrounding the Jerusalem holy site referred to by Jews as the Temple Mount because of the Jewish temples that stood there in biblical times. It is the most sacred place in Judaism; Muslims refer to it as the Noble Sanctuary, and it is their third holiest site, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe site is so holy that Jews have traditionally refrained from going there, instead praying at the adjacent Western Wall. Israel\u2019s chief rabbis have urged people not to ascend to the area, but in recent years, a small but growing number of Jews, including ultranationalist lawmakers, have begun regularly visiting the site.",

Siluanov has already warned that the big increase in defense spending earmarked for the next three years is unaffordable.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the consequences of geopolitics, they are, of course, substantial,\u201d Siluanov said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as critical for the exchange rate and even for the budget as the oil price.\u201d\n\nSiluanov\u2019s comments come on the eve of a crucial meeting of oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, which will focus on the alarming slide in oil prices since the summer. In a weekend interview with ITAR-TASS, Putin insinuated that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had conspired to drive up global supply well beyond actual levels of demand, in order to weaken the Russian economy. Somewhat confusingly, he later added that \u201cmaybe the Saudis want to \u2018kill off\u2019 their competitors\u201d in the U.S. shale oil sector.\u201d\n\nRussia isn\u2019t a member of OPEC, but depends on taxes from oil and gas companies for some two-thirds of its budget revenue. A draft for next year\u2019s budget, approved in September, assumes an average oil price of $100 a barrel, while banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase & Co. think it will be nearer $80.\n\nBarred from western financial markets, the government will either have to cut spending or raise taxes to keep the deficit down to its projected 0.6% of gross domestic product, or borrow at increasingly expensive rates from domestic savers and institutions. The yield on the government\u2019s 10-year bonds has risen to 10.12% as of Monday from 7.71% at the start of the year, as the ruble has depreciated by 30% against the dollar.\n\nRussia\u2019s central bank earlier this month cut its forecast for growth next year to zero, after having to raise interest rates sharply to stop the ruble\u2019s fall. GDP rose by only 0.8% on the year in the third quarter, although that was above economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe ruble has rebounded sharply against the dollar in recent days as the central bank\u2019s actions have started to gain traction and stem a wave of speculation. By mid-day in Moscow, the ruble was at its highest in more than two weeks against the dollar as oil and gas companies converted their export earnings back into rubles ahead of a routine tax payment deadline.",

And like Amazon, sales have grown rapidly \u2014 while its profit shrinks.\n\nThe upscale department store\u2019s overall revenue rose 9.8% to $3.12 billion for the quarter ending May 2. Comparable sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores, rose 4.4% from the year-ago period, the strongest among the company\u2019s peers.\n\nYet Nordstrom\u2019s profit fell to $128 million from $140 million while its return on invested capital fell just over one percentage point to 12.2%.\n\nNordstrom has been pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into building up its digital sales, expanding into Canada and planning a beachhead in Manhattan. It\u2019s doubling the size of its Rack outlet chain and acquired e-commerce sites like Trunk Club, as it looks to keep up with shoppers\u2019 quickly changing behavior and avoid the doldrums afflicting many brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\n\u201cOur customer strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the high level of service they expect from us,\u201d Blake Nordstrom, one of three siblings who are presidents at the retailer and scion of the company\u2019s founding family, said on a conference call with investors.\n\nIt seems to be working with Nordstrom now getting 20% of sales from e-commerce. That\u2019s well ahead of the 12% share of e-commerce at Macy\u2019s M and comparable to Neiman Marcus, which has a natural advantage thanks to its legacy catalog business. Two years ago, Nordstrom only got 13% of sales online.\n\nNordstrom\u2019s goal is to hit $20 billion in overall sales \u2014 bricks and mortar plus online \u2014 by 2020, 50% more than 2014 levels. To get there, the department store plans to spend $4.3 billion between now and 2019, or about 5% of sales.\n\nThe biggest chunk of that, $1.5 billion will be dedicated to technology and warehouses to speed up the delivery of online orders to better compete with Amazon, among others. For example, it is opening a new fulfillment center in Pennsylvania so that online orders can reach the East Coast more quickly.\n\nNordstrom is also spending big on things like updating its mobile shopping app and upgrading tools to better target customers with discount offers. It has added location-based features to it app and recently integrated its loyalty rewards program to make it easier for customers to redeem awards from mobile devices.\n\nWhile Nordstrom\u2019s full-service upscale department store will remain the centerpiece of the company\u2019s business (by 2020, it would still represent 58% of sales, the company told Wall Street analysts on Thursday), it is clear growth will have to come from elsewhere. Its traditional department stores had comparable sales growth of a mere 0.5% in the first quarter. In contrast, Nordstrom.com sales rose 20%.\n\nOn the discount store front, online sales at Nordstrom Rack and Nordstrom\u2019s flash sales site HauteLook.com, rose 51% to $117 million even as comparable sales at physical Rack stores slipped a bit. Nordstromrack.com launched only a year ago and the company has had to spend money to expand the assortment available on the site.\n\nAs for international expansion, Nordstrom recently opened its second Canadian store, in Ottawa. Long term, the retailer is planning six stores in Canada and thinks that market can eventually be a $1 billion business. It is also working on its first Manhattan department store, set to open in three years.\n\nWall Street has occasionally dinged Nordstrom for its big spending on new initiatives. But Thursday, after the earnings report, the company\u2019s shares JWN rose despite the profit dip because management showed that the investments are paying off.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story at Amazon, although it has taken big spending to a new level by tolerating quarterly losses. That company has been building up its cloud computing business, adding perks to its Prime subscription shipping plan, opening warehouses, and testing online grocery delivery. The result has been an industry leader with sales that rose 15% last quarter, and a loss that investors sometimes grumble about but forgive AMZN .\n\nThere must be something in the water in Seattle.\n\nFor more about Amazon, watch this Fortune video:",

        "text": "Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, who has died aged 78, was Australia's most distinguished potter. Because she had learned much of her craft in England, training with some of its best-known figures, and had set up her first studio in London, she achieved honorary status as an important British artist as well. The association with Britain has been rekindled in a memorable series of exhibitions in the UK over the past 20 years, and it was while visiting London for the latest of these that she suffered a stroke.\n\nHanssen Pigott created a new language for ceramics through her famous still-life groupings of pots, some extended into larger assemblies of pieces: bowls, bottles, beakers, jugs and cups displayed in carefully orchestrated arrangements. They were sculptural artworks, but used the most basic language of pottery forms, of everyday objects. Her roots as a functional maker were always clear, and owed much to her first teacher, the pioneering potter Ivan McMeekin, and her early admiration for Song dynasty Chinese pottery.\n\nBorn Gwyn John in Ballarat, Victoria, she discovered the beauties of oriental pots at the National Gallery of Victoria while a fine art student at Melbourne University. She was greatly influenced by Bernard Leach's A Potter's Book. Hearing about McMeekin, she succeeded in becoming apprenticed to him at his Mittagong studio in New South Wales. She was immersed in a creative philosophy that embraced the processing of raw materials, the rhythms of throwing on the wheel, and wood firing, all aspects that she carried with her in what she described as \"a very graceful potting life\".\n\nIn 1958, keen to build on this knowledge, she travelled to Britain to work with a succession of noted potters including Leach, Michael Cardew and Ray Finch. It was while she was with Finch at his Winchcombe workshop that she cycled 25 miles to my father Geoffrey Whiting's pottery in Worcestershire, arriving late in the evening and unannounced. Her energies were clearly devoted to her new passion, and to a studio movement only just burgeoning. In 1960 she and her husband, Louis Hanssen, set up a workshop in a basement in Notting Hill, London, where she produced well crafted tablewares for outlets including Heal's and Primavera, and she made useful contact with the potter Lucie Rie, which helped to inject a crisp modernity into her work.\n\nIn 1966, after the end of her marriage, Hanssen Pigott established a pottery at Ach\u00e8res, in the Loire valley, where she made handsome domestic ware in rich, muted glazes, as well as elegant, thinly potted porcelain and stoneware pieces that were premonitory of her later work. In 1973, she returned to Australia and subsequently created a studio in Tasmania with her second husband, John Pigott. She experimented further with wood firing, enjoying the varied surface effects of pots brushed by kiln flame. In a few years she was concentrating on porcelain alone, working with the chromatic combination of cool celadons and warmer orange and ochre surfaces.\n\nBy the late 80s, during which time she had residencies in Adelaide and Brisbane, the forms were stripped down to essentials, and the pots soon arranged in spatially nuanced configurations. Her admiration for the painter Giorgio Morandi was a particular catalyst. Hanssen Pigott loved the intensity of Morandi's gaze, his ability to make commonplace utility objects into something poetic. She enjoyed his focus on negative space, the pauses and intervals in his carefully staged groups. Hanssen Pigott translated such ideas into the studied poise of her increasingly ambitious, often lengthy, clusters of pots \u2013 pieces that were refined, quiet and superbly finished, and that intelligently explored relationships of shape, colour and tone. The effect was painterly as well as sculptural.\n\nBy the time she had moved in 1989 to Netherdale, in the sugar cane country of Queensland, her international reputation was being consolidated by extensive travelling and teaching, and by solo shows in countries including Britain, Australia, the US, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and Italy.\n\nIn London she was given beautifully presented exhibitions at Galerie Besson, Tate St Ives, and finally at Erskine, Hall & Coe. In 2002, shortly after moving to her last studio, at Ipswich in Queensland, she was awarded the medal of the Order of Australia; this was followed by a rare retrospective at the National Gallery of Victoria where, 50 years earlier, she had first fallen in love with ceramics.\n\nShe was energetic and lively in personality and prodigiously gifted, technically and intellectually; no one was more engaged with the language of clay or the wider visual world. As she said of the luminous translucency of her mature work: \"The way the pots transform in light is something special to me because this reflects what we are as human beings, ordinary but with the possibility of joy.\"\n\n\u2022 Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, potter, born 1 January 1935; died 5 July 2013",

        "text": "By Russell L. Parr and George Hovanec , guest contributors\n\nA January decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had a sweeping effect: it dropped the value of US patents. Just how much the value has been reduced, overall, is not yet known. Part of the reason we don\u2019t know is because the reduction in value is not going to be equally distributed across every patent. Rather, we know that patents owned by individual inventors, universities and research institutes will be hardest hit. Here, we\u2019ll explain what happened, and why it matters.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s what happened last month. A frequently used method in determining damages for patent infringement, \u201cthe 25% Rule of Thumb,\u201d was rejected by the Court in Uniloc USA, Inc. et al. v. Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft was found to infringe Uniloc\u2019s patent for a piece of technology. Expert testimony at trial concerning patent damages had, like many cases through history, relied on the 25% Rule of Thumb to determine damages owed to Uniloc.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT appealed the decision reached by the jury and the Court rejected the use of the 25% Rule of Thumb. Not just for this particular case \u2014 but for forever \u2014 even though it has been used in and out of court to determine royalty rates for decades.\n\nThe 25% rule isn\u2019t just for court cases, however. Patent owners often license the rights to use a patented invention in exchange for royalties. The royalty is usually a percentage rate (royalty rate) applied to the sales earned by using the patent. The \u201c25% Rule\u201d is a typical starting rate that suggests that 25% of the profits earned from using the invention goes to the patent owner while the remaining 75% stays with the licensee. The thinking here is that the licensee has brought other assets to the commercialization of the patented invention. These can include manufacturing expertise, well established brand names and a distribution network. By retaining 75% of the profits, the licensee is allowed to earn a return on its significant contribution.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all bad though: blind application of the 25% Rule can and does lead to errors. Many other factors must be considered \u2014 and usually are thoroughly considered \u2014 by most experts. But the rule can be a shortcut in both the good and bad sense of the word.\n\nWhen the licensed invention is central to the success of a product then the rule is a good starting point, such as when the patented invention is the active ingredient in a cancer therapy. But for example, if a design alternative can be inexpensively substituted without infringing the patent, an entirely different analysis is needed. When 25% Rule has been improperly applied, extraordinary damage awards for seemingly minor improvements to a product have been made. It seems the Court has become frustrated by these abuses of the 25% Rule and used the Microsoft/Uniloc case to react.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get complicated, and patent values can potentially go down: Companies whose patents are infringed can often find other ways to calculate damages especially against competitors who unfairly used their patents. But individual inventors, universities and research institutes typically cannot commercialize their inventions, and need to recover damages after the infringement has occurred. Without being able to rely on the 25% Rule, inventors, universities and research institutes have lost an important arrow in their quiver.\n\nBy making the determination of a royalty rate more difficult, it also becomes more difficult and expensive to protect patents from being infringed upon. And that could encourage more infringement to happen. All in all, it just became a lot harder for researchers and inventors to protect themselves in patent fights, especially if big corporations are the ones on the other side of the battle.\n\n\u2014 Russell L.

Along the way, FedEx built its own wireless network for tracking packages, one that has grown almost in parallel with U.S. wireless phone networks.\n\nFedEx Today, FedEx is expected to announce that its package-tracking data will start riding the same wireless phone networks that consumers use and that its employees will have a new way to collect and track that data. The company will announce that it has teamed up with wireless concern Motorola to design a new generation of handheld devices that will give FedEx couriers and other employees a more complete picture of the tracking process.\n\nFedEx will put some 40,000 of the new devices, dubbed FedEx PowerPad, in use. The devices will connect to wireless phone networks run by the AT&T Wireless unit of AT&T . They\u2019ll use the data-heavy general packet radio system (GPRS), which lets wireless consumers send e-mail and surf the Web from their mobile phones. The PowerPad has been built tough enough to resist drops and moisture, and to keep running for 12 hours at a time. And when FedEx delivers a package, customers will sign their names directly on the handheld\u2019s screen.\n\nSwitching to publicly available wireless phone networks will save FedEx the cost of operating much of the wireless network that it has for more than a decade. The company plans to take down radio towers where its old network is redundant with the GPRS network. And in places where GPRS isn\u2019t reliably available, the old towers will be relocated there, filling out the gaps.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice win for Motorola, which will be selling FedEx the devices over the next two years.

According to the New York Post:\n\nIn New York City, this will mean replacing 250,900 street signs with signs that cap up only the initial letter. So BROADWAY will become Broadway. A new font, Clearview, has been developed for the purpose. Cost: $27.6m (although, to put that figure in perspective, 8,000 signs have to be replaced every year for $110 each through normal wear and tear).\n\nOfficials argue that the changes will save lives and the city's transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, also suggested that the new signs might reflect a kinder, gentler New York. \"On the internet, writing in all caps means you are shouting,\" she said. \"Our new signs can quiet down, as well.\"\n\nDespite hysterical Daily News coverage that said \"several\" New Yorkers were \"outraged\" by the change \u2013 it quoted three \u2013 the paper's own poll showed that two-thirds of the public is behind the switch from capital letters.\n\nIt won't surprise regular Guardian readers that I agree with them. The Guardian style guide has long encouraged the gradual move away from capitals. So do other newspapers and websites, although some venerable style guides are still agonising over whether to lowercase internet and world wide web. (Be assured they will do so, perhaps in time for the 22nd century.)\n\nIn part, the switch from capitals reflects a society that is less deferential than in the days when the Manchester Guardian would write something like this: \"The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, Mr LLOYD GEORGE, presented the Naval Estimates to Ministers and Members of the House.\"\n\nMost readers seem comfortable with a less formal style. A grand total of two people complained about our coverage of the pope's, rather than the Pope's, recent visit to the UK. We did receive a letter last week complaining that calling David Cameron the prime minister, not the Prime Minister (a style we have been following for more than a decade) reflected a \"lowering of standards\", but such complaints are few.\n\nWe need to be ever-vigilant, however, against the capital offenders. Politicians, civil servants and Estate Agents are three groups that remain intent on drowning us all in this alphabet soup. (Yesterday I was presented with a government statement that said: \"On the Chancellor's recommendation the Prime Minister has appointed the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to the Public Expenditure Committee ... \")\n\nCapitals do have their uses, of course. As the Urban Dictionary puts it: \"Capitalisation is the difference between 'I had to help my uncle Jack off a horse' and 'I had to help my uncle jack off a horse.'\"\n\nTo return to traffic signs. New York's commendable decision is an echo of one taken in the UK 50 years ago, when the brilliant designers Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert, given the task of updating the country's chaotic system of road signs, concluded that \"a combination of upper and lowercase letters would be more legible than conventional uppercase lettering\". They produced a new font, known as Transport, which they felt would be friendlier and more appealing to British drivers than the stark modernist style used in continental Europe. The classic British road signage that they designed is still in use.",

And, in part due to potential Brexit-related macro demand risks, demand for the iPhone 7 may fall below Wall Street figures, Cowen notes.\n\nBut recent data on the number of iPhone units in use has also suggested that more and more consumers are holding onto their iPhones for two years or more\u2014creating something of a powder keg in the form of a \u201csuper-cycle\u201d for 2017.\n\n\u201cAgainst a backdrop of a new OLED-enabled form-factor in 2017, this argues that either 1) iPhone 7 is better than expected, or more likely 2) a \u201csuper-cycle\u201d is setting up for iPhone in 2017. Given risk/ reward of 4:1, it pays to get involved and wait it out,\u201d Cowen wrote. OLED refers to a type of screen that is superior to LED screens. OLED panels are said to be thinner, lighter, and can be curved.\n\nRoughly 33% of iPhones active now are over two-years-old now, Cowen wrote. That figure is set to rise to about 43% in the next four to five quarters.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the entire growth of the base\u2014and then some\u2014will be from older units that are ripe for upgrades, especially to a new OLED-enabled form factor,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts reiterated their \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock and gave it a price target of $125, saying that Apple is currently trading at 34% discount to the wider S&P 500.",

As a result, Casale said agents are increasingly focused on showing the tipper received a monetary or other tangible benefit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a slowdown in our process of thinking about cases,\u201d Casale said in an interview last week. \u201cThis was a hurdle we had to overcome.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the FBI and prosecutors will be able to ultimately bring charges in those 30 undisclosed investigations. Such probes can often be closed without charges being brought.\n\nThe FBI would not comment on the details of the undisclosed probes and did not provide information on how advanced they were. Casale said some involved multiple individuals.\n\nThe law of insider trading meanwhile remains in flux. The U.S. Supreme Court in January agreed to review an appellate ruling out of California, and could use that case to clarify the definition of insider trading.\n\nThe FBI has been pursuing insider trading cases with, among others, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has since 2009 announced charges against 107 people, and secured convictions of 81 individuals.\n\nThose charged this year include famed Las Vegas sports gambler William \u201cBilly\u201d Walters, who has pleaded not guilty, and hedge fund manager Sanjay Valvani, who worked at Visium Asset Management LP and committed suicide last month following his indictment.\n\nCasale said he was optimistic that the FBI\u2019s undisclosed probes would result in more individuals being charged, despite the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. Still, he acknowledged that the decision posed additional hurdles.\n\n\u201cIt may take more stones to overturn than it would have in the past,\u201d he said.",

That's because the Answers in Genesis ministry, of which Ham is the president, believes the world is no more than 6000 years old.\n\n\"It was a clash of world views,\" Ham said in the social media post.\n\nIt's not the first time his and Nye's world views have clashed. In 2014 the pair agreed to a public debate at the Creation Museum, which was held in front of a packed house and viewed by millions around the world.\n\n\"I held strongly to the view that it was an opportunity to expose the well-intending Ken Ham and the support he receives from his followers as being bad for Kentucky, bad for science education, bad for the US, and thereby bad for humankind,\" Nye said of the event, and it looks as if there's been nary a trickle under the bridge since then.\n\n\"I publicly prayed for Bill,\" Ham wrote of Nye's trip to the ark. \"I did ask him if we could be friends, but he said we could be acquaintances with mutual respect, but not friends.\"\n\nIn addition to the disagreement between scientists and Creationists, the ark's construction has stirred up ill-feeling among Kentuckians who feel the government-funding of the project crosses a boundary.\n\n\"It\u2019s a clear violation of separation of church and state,\" local man Jim Helton said, referring to sales tax incentives worth tens of millions granted to Answers in Genesis earlier this year.\n\n\"What they\u2019re doing is utterly ridiculous and anywhere else, I don\u2019t think it would be allowed \u2026 Basically, this boat is a church raising scientifically illiterate children and lying to them about science,\" Helton told News Observer.\n\nFor the triumphant Ham, however, those details matter not now that his dream is finally afloat.\n\n\"I believe this is going to be one of the greatest Christian outreaches of this era in history,\" he said.\n\n\"People are going to come from all over the world.\"\n\n\u00a9 Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016",

        "text": "The simplest approach is to buy an add-on to your holiday from a tour operator that has a specialist wedding department. The cost - from about \u00a3150 to over \u00a32,000 - is determined by location and exotic extras. Options such as mariachi bands, helicopter rides and Balinese dancers send the price rocketing.\n\nAs a rule, the package includes sorting out the legal administration, organising the bouquet, buttonholes, cake and a Champagne reception. Photography or video recording usually costs extra. Most wedding packages are overseen by a co-ordinator, and can usually be customised, on request.\n\nBe wary of \"free weddings\" tacked on to the cost of a honeymoon package. These can sometimes translate into a swift exchange of vows witnessed by gawking hotel guests - with dodgy photographs, cheap cake and sweet fizzy wine.\n\nBefore choosing a hotel, check the number of weddings it carries out. Some resorts stage so many that newlyweds can find themselves sharing their special day with rather more people than they had intended. Couples who decide not to bring any relatives may enjoy the cameraderie. But those who want to avoid the risk of a ceremony conducted as the next party is lined up on the lawn would be well advised to select a hotel where weddings are not the main trade.\n\nWeddings abroad can be insured, although this is intended to supplement rather than replace travel insurance. Similarly, a ceremony overseas and a reception at home can be covered under one policy.\n\nBesides contacting tour operators and tourist boards, you can obtain general advice on the internet. Useful sites include www.confetti.co.uk's travel section and and www.weddingsabroad.com.\n\nIn Las Vegas just about anything goes. Pick up your licence from the county clerk's office at the courthouse and then, for the most bizarre ceremonies, look up Charlotte Richards, \"the wedding queen\", an ordained minister who owns the most famous chapels in town. She has officiated at weddings on horseback, while a bride-to-be was in labour, and even on a mountain, where the lovers were supported by ropes.\n\nMore mundane Vegas choices include drive-in chapels, where the ceremony takes three minutes and you don't even have to turn the engine off, and themed ceremonies such as the \"Elvis Experience\", complete with a Presley-lookalike serenading the nuptials and a ride in a pink Cadillac.\n\nBritish Airways Holidays (0870 608 2244) has Las Vegas wedding packages from \u00a3149 per couple. Flights, transfers and accommodation extra.\n\nIn Florida, keen divers can mouth, \"I do,\" surrounded by branches of coral and in the company of grouper and angel fish. White taffeta and lace wetsuits might be hard to track down, but a tick on a slate will confirm you as man and wife. Non-divers are taught enough basics to last them for the 20 minutes underwater, while qualified divers need only bring their dive certificates.\n\nThe cost of the wedding starts at $100 (about \u00a369) payable locally, and the basic diving course costs from \u00a3134. Contact Virgin Holidays (01293 744265).\n\nFollow in the footsteps of Taylor and Burton and marry in Botswana. Their second wedding took place within the Moorish-style Chobe Game Lodge, in the national park in the north-east of the country. The lodge is famed for its incomparable viewing of elephants, buffalo and antelope. Couples marry on the terrace or while cruising on the Chobe River. The tour operator promises all brides and grooms a \"complimentary mini-bar with unlimited supply of drinks\".\n\nArgo Holidays (020 7331 7095) has three- night all-inclusive wedding packages to Chobe from \u00a32,059 per person.\n\nOnly a few years ago, the red tape surrounding marrying in Italy, made the Maastricht Treaty sound simple. But now you can leave the to-ing and fro-ing between consulates to a handful of specialists.\n\nThe choice of venues can be wonderfully romantic - from a Venetian gondola to a sailing boat off Capri, or a Tuscan castle.\n\nThe Castello Vincigliata near Fiesole, a medieval tower discovered and restored by Lord John Temple Leader in 1840, overlooks Florence. You can exchange vows with an English-speaking Catholic or Anglican priest officiating, enjoy a wedding picnic in an olive grove, or even - if you give enough notice and money - stage a six-course Italian feast with performance by Luciano Pavarotti himself.\n\nWeddings Made in Italy (020 7520 0470) can arrange a wedding package here from \u00a31,989 including a priest and a picnic.\n\nNew to the nuptial scene is Lapland. For skiing couples fancying a touch of synchronised wipe-out, Inghams (020 8780 4433) features weddings on the slopes, followed by a blessing in the parish church of Levi. At \u00a350, the ceremony is something of a bargain - but alcohol in Lapland is far from cheap and unfortunately you can't take your own. Interesting extras include stag or hen sauna-parties, a horse-drawn sleigh ride to church, and - something of a passion-killer perhaps - a honeymoon igloo.\n\nA week in Levi costs from \u00a3398 per person including half board in a three-star hotel, return flights and transfers.",

Supporters ended up raising over $115 million for the A.L.S. Association.\n\nOver two years, money from the challenge has helped fund the research and development of treatment drugs and has been used as prize money to entice people to design technology for people living with the disease, which causes a rapid breakdown in a person\u2019s ability to control muscle movement.\n\nThe association released a chart last year showing where the funds went:\n\n\u2022 $77 million, or 67 percent, went to research.\n\n\u2022 $23 million, or 20 percent, went to patient and community services.\n\n\u2022 $10 million, or 9 percent, went to public and professional education.\n\n\u2022 $3 million, or 2 percent, went to fund-raising.\n\n\u2022 And $2 million, roughly another 2 percent, went to payment processing fees.\n\nThe latest development, announced by the association this week, falls into the research category: It\u2019s the discovery of NEK1, which scientists say is among the most common genes that contribute to the disease and is associated with 3 percent of A.L.S. cases. The discovery, published in Nature Genetics, is the result of a global gene-sequencing effort involving 11 countries and 80 researchers, called Project MinE.\n\nThe challenge money allowed the association to invest $1 million in Project MinE, and \u201cinitiated the U.S. arm of this international effort,\u201d Carrie Munk, a spokeswoman for the association, said.\n\nThe discovery of NEK1 is significant but is not a breakthrough \u2014 some 30 genes tied to the disease have already been identified \u2014 according to Brian Frederick, executive vice president for communications and development for the A.L.S. Association.\n\nMr. Frederick said that the discovery of the gene could eventually mean that \u201ctreatments won\u2019t be limited to one subset of people with A.L.S., but that it might be a more broad group.\u201d\n\nThe movement took the internet by storm in July 2014, and many supporters trace the tipping point to a video posted by Pete Frates, a former college baseball player who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012. Others followed suit, including celebrities from Mark Zuckerberg to Lena Dunham, who consented to having a bucket of water dumped over their heads for a good cause.\n\nThe challenge spread as wildly as it did because the premise involved people reaching out to each other on social media with a simple request: Film yourself getting water dumped over your head or donate money to A.L.S. research. Many did both, but critics disparaged the movement as \u201cslacktivism\u201d or an outright racket.

The findings, published in PLOS Genetics, provide a map of African-American genetic diversity, shedding light on both their history and their health.\n\nBuried in DNA, the researchers found the marks of slavery\u2019s cruelties, including further evidence that white slave owners routinely fathered children with women held as slaves.\n\nAnd there are signs of the migration that led their descendants away from such oppression: Genetically related African-Americans are distributed closely along the routes they took to leave the South, the scientists discovered.\n\nThe importance of that finding is not just historical, said Dr. Esteban G. Burchard, a physician and scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA detailed map of genetic variations in African-Americans will help show how genes influence their risk for various diseases. \u201cThis has tremendous medical relevance,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil recently, most research into the link between genes and disease has focused on people of European descent. \u201cWe\u2019re missing out on a lot of biology and diversity,\u201d said Simon Gravel, a geneticist at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nThe history of African-Americans poses special challenges for geneticists. During the slave trade, their ancestors were captured from genetically diverse populations across a portion of West Africa. Adding to the complexity is the fact that living African-Americans also may trace some of their ancestry to Europeans and Native Americans.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Gravel and his colleagues analyzed the DNA of 3,726 African-Americans who participated in three separate medical studies.\n\nThe scientists were able to pinpoint stretches of DNA in the subjects that originated on different continents. According to their calculations, the ancestors of the average African-American today were 82.1 percent African, 16.7 percent European and 1.2 percent Native American.\n\nDr. Gravel and his colleagues also estimated when those genes were introduced.\n\nWhen two parents from different ethnic backgrounds have a family, their children share long stretches of identical DNA. Over the generations, the stretches get smaller. The lengths serve as a kind of genealogical clock.\n\nMost of the Native American DNA identified by Dr. Gravel and his colleagues in African-Americans occurs now in tiny chunks. The scientists concluded that most of the mingling between Africans and Native Americans took place soon after the first slaves arrived in the American colonies in the early 1600s.\n\nThe European DNA in African-Americans, on the other hand, occurs in slightly longer chunks, indicating a more recent origin. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues estimate that its introduction dates to the decades before the Civil War.\n\nThe scientists gave some attention to the X chromosome in particular because of its role in sex determination. One X chromosome is inherited from mothers; fathers may contribute a Y or X.\n\nThe researchers observed that the X chromosome of African-Americans has a greater African ancestry than other chromosomes. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues believe this variation is explained by European men and African women producing children \u2014 in other words, slave owners raping the women they held captive.\n\nThe databases that Dr. Gravel and his colleagues studied also included information about where the subjects now live. The scientists used this information to help trace the movements of African-Americans through the United States.\n\nThey found very strong genetic connections between African-Americans in the Deep South and those in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nThe genetic similarities in African-Americans tend to cluster along the very train lines that their forebears took as they left the Jim Crow South: the Illinois Central to Chicago, for example, and the Atlantic Coast line up the East Coast.\n\nThe scientists were intrigued to find that European Americans who live in the South now are more closely related to African-Americans in the North or West than to present-day African-Americans in the South.\n\nDr. Gravel has proposed a surprising explanation: \u201cThe first people to migrate out of the South were the ones with the most European ancestry,\u201d he said.\n\nAlondra Nelson, the dean of social science at Columbia University and the author of \u201cThe Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation after the Genome\u201d said she did not think that result contributed much to understanding who left the South or why.\n\nIn the study, she noted, the researchers found just 1 percent more European ancestry in the African Americans who left the South.\n\nDr. Nelson noted that historians are increasingly collaborating on genetic studies like these. But the new study does not include a historian among its authors.\n\n\u201cThe human intentions around escaping racial terror can\u2019t possibly be reduced to genotype,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in understanding the Great Migration, it\u2019s a tremendous lost opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the new study said that the genetic variations of African-Americans across the United States could be important for medical research. Researchers who want to study the influence of genes on diseases in African-Americans must be aware of where their subjects live.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re drawing your cases from Chicago, can you use controls from South Carolina?\u201d asked Eimear E. Kenny, a geneticist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and a co-author of the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study would suggest you have to be very, very careful about that.\u201d\n\nDr. Burchard of U.C. San Francisco said that a better understanding of African-American genetics could also lead to discoveries that could benefit all people. Scientists found a rare genetic mutation in an African-American woman, for example, that lowered her cholesterol levels. That discovery led to a promising drug for heart disease.\n\n\u201cLo and behold, it was relevant to all populations, regardless of race,\u201d said Dr. Burchard. \u201cIt\u2019s relevant if you\u2019re European, if you\u2019re African, if you\u2019re Asian, if you\u2019re pink, white, blue or green.\u201d\n\nAn article on Saturday about a new study of African-American genetic diversity misstated the number of Africans brought to the United States as slaves. Though a precise figure is not known, scholars believe the number to be in the hundreds of thousands, not millions.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 28, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Study Reveals Genetic Routes of African-American Ancestry.

        "text": "Labour has not ruled out the possibility of another referendum on the European Union, whether over continued membership or the terms of Britain leaving the bloc, according to a briefing note circulated among the party\u2019s MPs.\n\nThe 10-page document, prepared by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and Barry Gardiner, the shadow minister for Europe, also lays out how Labour hopes to have a say in Brexit negotiations.\n\n\u201cBritain has now been left in a total mess of the Tory government\u2019s own making,\u201d the document states.\n\nOn the idea of a second referendum, the paper, a copy of which was passed to the Guardian, says that many Labour activists have appealed for a rerun of the referendum, in part because of \u201cthe disinformation of the leave campaign and the dysfunction of the government\u201d.\n\nIt argues that before exit takes place \u201cthere should be the opportunity for some further injection of democracy into this process, so that either the public or their parliamentary representatives are able to vote on the reality of a post-Brexit Britain\u201d.\n\nRelated: Britain's economy shrinking at fastest rate since 2009, says survey\n\nEarlier this month the Labour leadership challenger, Owen Smith, said he would like to see a referendum on any Brexit deal. However, the party\u2019s leadership has previously been less keen, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appearing to rule it out.\n\nGardiner and Thornberry, the latter of whom has also taken the role of shadowing David Davis, the new Brexit minister, stress there are risks in proposing a new referendum or running a general election campaign based on overturning the EU decision or offering a vote on the terms of exit.\n\n\u201cSome colleagues are concerned that this would look like trying to have a second in-out referendum by the back door,\u201d they write.\n\nThe document, titled Responding to the EU Referendum Result, shows continued uncertainty within Labour over how to balance controls on the free movement of EU nationals into Britain against trade with the bloc. On Thursday, France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, told the British prime minister, Theresa May, that staying in the EU\u2019s single market could not happen if the UK imposed control over arrivals.\n\nThe briefing note agrees this balance will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, and that Labour had to accept voters\u2019 concerns over immigration. The document says the party must have a strong voice on the subject but does not yet set out what this will be. It tells MPs: \u201cIt will take time, and much greater consultation within the party, to develop proposals in this area, but that will be our priority for the coming months.\u201d\n\nOther areas are much clearer. The document says Labour deplores May\u2019s lack of guarantee for the status of EU nationals already in Britain, arguing this has \u201ccreated a climate where a small minority of individuals in our society feel it is acceptable to talk in terms of EU migrants living in Britain being told to go home\u201d.\n\nThe document also calls for the party to campaign hard over preserving rights originating from EU rules, such as those over employment.\n\nIt demands a delay in triggering article 50, which would formally set a two-year process for departure. This should not happen, the document argues, \u201cuntil there is a clear plan in place about what the UK will be negotiating for, and how that is going to be achieved, and until there has been some form of consultation on that negotiating plan, and formal approval of it by parliament and/or the public\u201d.\n\nOn a more openly party political note, a section of the document titled Key Lines to Take, urges Labour MPs to say the confusion is the fault of the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cIt was David Cameron who set a wholly artificial timetable for this referendum, believing that internal opposition inside the Tory party would be quelled as a result of his election victory last year,\u201d one reads. \u201cHe was wrong, and we ended up with media coverage of the referendum campaign entirely dominated by the bitter in-fighting within his cabinet.\u201d",

        "text": "It was a coincidence that our trip to Bruges coincided with the Procession of the Holy Blood, which happens every year on Ascension Day. The procession dates from the 13th century and commemorates the return from the Second Crusade of the Count of Flanders, who is said to have brought with him some of the blood of Jesus. We knew that the relic would be paraded through the city in the afternoon, but other than that we had no idea what to expect.\n\nMore than 30,000 people turned up for the procession. We had neglected to reserve a seat in the stands in the main square or a caf\u00e9 chair on the pavement, so we peered out over the crowd while standing on a bench.\n\nWe quickly worked out that the procession involved scenes from the Bible, but without a programme we had to guess which ones they were. Some floats were easy to make sense of (a pharaoh in an elaborate headdress flanked by two pointy golden pillars; a statue of Jesus carried by dozens of Roman soldiers in tiny white shorts), while others were less so (a lounging couple in Arabian dress with a life-size stuffed peacock). There were sheep and donkeys, people waving palm fronds and purple-robed dancers bearing the Star of Bethlehem. It was confusing and colourful and I couldn\u2019t stop watching, even though my legs were cramping and my Bible knowledge is patchy at best.\n\nAfter the death and resurrection of Jesus, actors depicted the arrival of the relic into Bruges in 1150. Numerous knights on horses paraded through the city, followed by a man who discreetly picked up the droppings.\n\nThen the bell in the belfry tower began to toll ominously.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Blood must be coming,\u201d my friend said.\n\nPeople stood silently in reverence as clergymen carrying an elaborate gold reliquary walked by. Whether you believed in the authenticity of the relic or not, it was hard not to get swept up in the pageantry of it all.\n\nThe procession ended with a man on a castle-shaped float pulled by horses playing an intricate set of bells. Their delicate chime mixed with the heavy, rhythmic tone of the bell from the tower. A strangely beautiful song for a strangely beautiful parade.\n\nYour travel writing could earn you \u00a31,000.
