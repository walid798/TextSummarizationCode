## Overview
In this study, we systematically evaluate large language models (LLMs) on four text summarization tasks across different domains, including:

News Summarization: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom datasets
Dialogue Summarization: SAMSum dataset
Scientific Papers Summarization: ArXiv dataset
The study explores the performance of LLMs using multiple prompt engineering techniques, such as zero-shot and in-context learning. Evaluation metrics include ROUGE and BERTScore, among others.

## Prompts
Due to the difference nature of the used datasets we used different prompts for each dataset in ZSL and FSL.
## Results
The results of each experiment are stored in the results/ directory. This includes:

Generated summaries for each dataset
Evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore)
We also include a sample table from the paper displaying reference summaries and generated summaries for qualitative comparison.

## Evaluation_Metrics
The following evaluation metrics were used to assess the model performance:

ROUGE: Measures overlap between generated and reference summaries.
BERTScore: Computes similarity using contextual embeddings.
For details on how each metric is calculated, see code/evaluation/.
